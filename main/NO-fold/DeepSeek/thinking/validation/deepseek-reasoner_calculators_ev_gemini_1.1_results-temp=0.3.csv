0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts: ""thinking about ending my life again.""  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""Never will find love,"" ""everything in my life is crap""), self-loathing (""I hate being myself""), and distress (""mental breakdown"").  
   - Specific method and location: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""  
   - No past actions described (e.g., no mention of prior attempts or initiated acts).  
   - Imminence: Future intention (""I want to go"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""ending my life"" and ""jump off"" (in suicidal context).  
   - Clear desire to die: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" indicates active wish.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method/location: ""jump off"" a bridge.  
   - Preparation implied by stated intention (""want to go to a bridge"").  
   - No tools or notes mentioned, but method/location is explicit.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""thinking about,"" ""I want to"").  
   - ""Again"" references recurring thoughts, not a past attempt.  
   - No description of initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method (bridge/jumping) → **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Indicator"" (desire is explicit, not abstract/unwanted).  
   - Not ""Ideation"" (method/plan specified).  
   - Not ""Attempt"" (no past/initiated lethal action).

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress (""I'm inconsolable"") and a personal statement about imminent death (""I'm going to die soon""). 
   - There is **no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means**. The phrase ""die soon"" suggests despair but lacks concrete suicidal terminology.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (implied by ""inconsolable"" and fatalistic tone). 
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or past actions** are described. 
   - Temporal context (""soon"") implies future imminence but remains vague and non-specific. 
   - The writer’s stated desire focuses on inevitability of death rather than an active wish to die by suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - ""I'm going to die soon"" expresses fatalism/despair but **does not clearly state a desire to die by suicide** (e.g., lacks ownership like ""I *want* to die""). It could reflect hopelessness without suicidal intent. 
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  
   - **Leans toward 'Indicator'** due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None mentioned or implied**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes a future-oriented belief (""going to die soon"") with **no past actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core issue is **distress and hopelessness** without explicit personal desire to die by suicide.  
   - ""I'm going to die soon"" is fatalistic but ambiguous; it could stem from depression/illness without suicidal intent.  
   - **No plan/method** rules out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.  
   - Ambiguity about active suicidal desire meets the **'Indicator' threshold** (per rules: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator"").

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life (""I hate living"") and existential despair (""sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night""). There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and anger, but no references to being a burden, anhedonia, or specific plans/preparations. The language focuses on hating life and questioning existence, with no stated desire for death or suicide. No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die is expressed; phrases like ""I hate living"" convey distress about life but not an explicit wish to end it (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). The thoughts about existence are framed as questioning why one must live, not as a personal intent to act on suicidal urges. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so the ""unwanted thoughts"" consideration doesn't apply. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The content is purely emotional and philosophical, with no actionable elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or initiations. It focuses on ongoing distress, not concrete behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal desire to die or explicit suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I hate living"" indicate dissatisfaction with life, but without suicidal ideation, plans, or actions. Ambiguity exists in whether ""I hate living"" implies a desire to die, but per the rules, if in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'. No elements align with 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no past actions). Thus, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide and a desire to die.
   - It includes a specific method: ""barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which are substances used for lethal overdoses.
   - The plea ""Help me"" and ""Please somebody help me find"" shows active preparation to acquire the means, demonstrating intent to carry out the act.
   - There is no mention of past actions, only current/future intentions.
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself,"" showing explicit suicidal intent.
   - The author expresses a genuine wish to die (e.g., ""help me kill myself""), with no negation or indication of unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal) is mentioned.
   - Preparation is evident in the request for help to ""find"" the substance, indicating active steps to acquire means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (seeking means to act), not past actions.
   - No initiated lethal action is described (e.g., no mention of having taken pills or similar), so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal desire.
   - It includes more than just thoughts (Ideation) because a method and preparation are specified.
   - The lack of a past or recent initiated lethal action rules out Attempt.
   - Therefore, it fits Behavior: explicit suicidal thoughts with a plan/method (barbiturates) and preparation (seeking to acquire them).

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post opens with a direct question about methods: ""Is there a painless way to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm struggling,"" ""I feel worthless""), self-blame (""selfish,"" ""lazy""), anhedonia (""unmotivated,"" ""tired""), and isolation (""stay in my room"").  
   - The phrase ""I want to sleep forever"" metaphorically expresses a desire for death, and ""how to die with certainty and without pain"" references methods but **does not specify any concrete plan, tool, location, or preparation**.  
   - No mention of past actions, attempts, or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer expresses distress about their state but **does not explicitly negate suicidal thoughts or affirm a desire to live**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Is there a painless way to die"" and ""I want to sleep forever"" imply a personal desire to die, framed as seeking escape from pain. Though not phrased as ""I will kill myself,"" the context shows a genuine wish for death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: The question about ""painless ways"" is general and exploratory. No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings and hypothetical questions. **No description of past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""want to sleep forever"") places this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguous/no personal desire).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned—only a general query about methods—so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.  
   - **No initiated action** described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
   - Best fits **'Ideation'**: Explicit personal desire to die (""I want to sleep forever"") without concrete plans.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""want to kill myself,"" ""still want to die,"" and ""should do it anyways,"" indicating a personal desire to die. 
   - It expresses hopelessness (""life is all pointless""), anhedonia (""nothing matters""), and existential despair (""why shouldn't we just kill ourselves"").
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described; only persistent thoughts over a year.
   - Temporal context focuses on ongoing feelings (""for a year straight,"" ""still have this feeling"") without imminent plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""still want to die"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. The author never negates this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: While suicidal desire is clear, there is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The discussion remains philosophical about life’s meaning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes persistent suicidal thoughts over the past year but **no concrete past/current actions** (e.g., ""I tried to...""). Only ideation is referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a **personal desire to die** (""still want to die""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicidal intent). 
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Thus, 'Ideation' fits best: explicit desire to die with thoughts of suicide but no plan or action.

   → **Yes**, explicit desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Desire to turn ""mental pain into physical"" suggests possible self-harm ideation but **no specific method** (e.g., cutting, overdose) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).  
   → **No** plan/method/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""tonight"") but **no description of past/current initiated lethal actions** (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   → Not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit desire to die rules this out.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I just want to get it over with"" (suggesting a desire to end suffering) and fear of ""the pain if I go through with it"" (implying suicidal action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses feelings of abandonment, self-blame (""maybe it's me?""), and a pattern of pushing people away due to expecting rejection (""they will leave so let's get this over with"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""everyone leaves""), resignation (""it still hurts""), and self-deprecation (""I'd leave myself if I could"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" suggests a desire to escape emotional pain but **lacks direct suicidal intent** (e.g., no ""die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

   - ""I'd leave myself"" is metaphorical and lacks explicit suicidal intent; it aligns with feeling trapped by emotional pain, not a wish to die.  
   - **No evidence of suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**. Falls under **Indicator** due to general distress and absence of personal desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains expressions of severe emotional distress: hopelessness (""it's not fixable, there is no hope""), despair, anhedonia, self-loathing, and feelings of being inadequate/broken. 
   - **Crucially, it explicitly states: ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now.""** This is a direct expression of a future suicidal plan with a specific timeline (""at 21"").
   - There are no mentions of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).

   - The phrase ""whether i want to or not"" suggests internal conflict but does not negate the stated plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes.** The phrase ""i plan to kill myself"" is an explicit, direct statement of suicidal intent from the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Plan:** Yes. The author specifies a temporal plan (""at 21""). 
   - **Method/Preparation:** No. No specific means, location, or preparatory actions (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. 
   - The presence of a specific timeline (""at 21"") qualifies as a **plan**, pushing this beyond mere ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The suicidal plan (""kill myself at 21"") is future-oriented. 
   - **No description of a past or recent initiated action** (e.g., taking pills, self-harm). Mentions of current feelings (e.g., anhedonia) are not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit personal desire to die (""plan to kill myself"") is present.
   - **Ideation?** No. While desire is present, the specific future timeline (""at 21"") constitutes a **plan**, moving it beyond ideation.
   - **Behavior?** **Yes.** The combination of explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") and a stated plan (""at 21"") meets the definition. A specific method isn't required for 'Behavior'—a plan suffices.
   - **Attempt?** No. No past or recent initiated lethal action is described.

I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case. Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?I have prolly stopped making sense at this point. But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mention of ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon"" shows a direct expression of suicidal desire but with a stated delay (""5 more years"").
   - Strong emotional indicators: self-loathing (""don't like anything about myself""), hopelessness (""don't see ANY PURPOSE""), isolation, and chronic distress (""crying myself to sleep every night"").
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, notes), or past/current actions.
   - The writer explicitly negates imminent risk (""not any time soon"") while maintaining a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: ""I want to die"" is a clear personal expression of suicidal desire. The delay (""5 more years"") does not negate the underlying wish to die but confirms it is not immediate.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**: No reference to a method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means). The timeline (""5 more years"") is vague and lacks concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). Only future-oriented thoughts with a distant timeline.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: ""I want to die"" is an explicit personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no genuine suicidal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned. The timeline (""5 more years"") is not a specific plan but a general postponement.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent, as no concrete past/recent action is described.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses a current desire to die without plans or preparations, fitting 'Ideation'. The delay in acting does not downgrade the explicit suicidal intent.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to.

I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""the only way out is suicide"") and a specific method (""I've considered hanging"").  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I'm stuck in this rat race""), despair (""things are just crushing""), anhedonia (""I have no interest in doing anything""), and feeling overwhelmed.  
   - A method (hanging) is mentioned, but no preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) or timeline is specified.  
   - The author states they lack the ability to act (""I don't have the guts to do it,"" ""I can't seem to go through with it""), framing the suicidal thoughts as unwanted or unactionable.  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, explicit phrases include: ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I should just make my escape.""  
   - Desire to die is present but conflicted (repeatedly states inability to act).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, a specific method (""hanging"") is mentioned.  
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or imminent timelines are indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intentions** with no mention of past actions. The phrase ""I've considered hanging"" refers to thoughts, not an initiated act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method mentioned = **Behavior**.  
   - Though the author expresses inability to act (""don't have the guts""), the presence of a method overrides ambiguity.  
   - No initiated lethal action (rules out 'Attempt'), and method specification distinguishes from 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""suicidal notes ready.""  
   - Desire: Clear personal intent (""i already know i'm going to kill myself,"" ""i've decided on it"").  
   - Plan/Method: Notes prepared (""got my suicidal notes ready""); method/timeframe implied but not specified (""matter of when and how"").  
   - Temporal context: Future-oriented (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").  
   - Action: No past/initiated lethal action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: ""kill myself"" is a direct phrase; desire is explicitly stated and affirmed (""decided on it""). No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes: Preparations confirmed (""got my suicidal notes ready""). Method/time are pending but actively considered (""matter of when and how"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Future intention only. No description of past/initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire + preparations (notes) = **Behavior**.  
   - Not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit/personal).  
   - Not 'Ideation' (preparations present).  
   - Not 'Attempt' (no initiated lethal action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing, disgust with appearance, and a desire to escape (""wish I could press a button and be someone else"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i still look disgusting""), despair (""i hate everything about myself""), and anhedonia (fatigue around daily routines like getting dressed/makeup).  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focus is on dissatisfaction with identity/appearance, not a wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a desire to die.  
   - The wish to ""be someone else"" implies distress about identity, not a literal desire to end life.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, unwanted or otherwise.  
   → Leans strongly toward *Indicator*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No references** to plans, methods (tools, locations), or preparations (notes, acquiring means).  
   - Actions described (dying hair, changing clothes) relate to self-image struggles, not suicide planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional distress and past efforts to alter appearance.  
   - **No mention** of past/current suicidal actions, attempts, or imminent intentions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core issue is distress about self-image/identity, **not a desire to die**.  
   - Absence of suicidal intent, plans, methods, or past attempts rules out *Ideation*, *Behavior*, and *Attempt*.  
   - Meets *Indicator* criteria: expresses hopelessness and despair but lacks personal suicidal desire.

17,"What are you hoping to gain?. For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves or are in the process of doing so, what do you hope to gain by posting that information here? In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post discusses people who post about intending to kill themselves or being in the process, but it is framed as a question and opinion about others' motivations. The author states that such posts are likely cries for help rather than genuine intent to self-harm.
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods from the author's perspective. Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are absent; the tone is analytical and opinion-based.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide are described by the author for themselves.
   - The author does not express any personal desire to die, imminence of suicide, or unwanted suicidal thoughts; instead, they focus on interpreting others' behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post references phrases like ""kill themselves"" or ""in the process of doing so,"" but these are attributed to other people, not the author. The author does not use direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or express a personal desire for suicide.
   - Suicidal thoughts are discussed in the context of others, and the author explicitly negates genuine intent (""isn't really wanting to hurt themselves""), but this is not about the author's own thoughts. There is no indication of personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned by the author for themselves. The discussion of suicide methods or processes is general and about others, not the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes hypothetical or others' actions, not the author's past, current, or future actions. No initiated suicidal actions by the author are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post involves abstract discussion of suicide (e.g., why people post about it) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from the author. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes general or abstract mentions of suicide without current, personal suicidal intent. There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (personal plan or preparation), or 'Attempt' (personal initiated action). Given the focus on others and the absence of personal risk factors, 'Indicator' is appropriate.

I just want someone to love me and accept me and its never going to happen. I want to be brave enough to kill myself but the past two times ive tried ive failed. Im so tired and sad.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""no point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive""), despair (""Im so tired and sad""), and feelings of being a burden (""every thing you do and every word that comes out of your mouth hurts the people that you love""). It explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" and references past suicidal actions with ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" There is no mention of a specific current plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The temporal context includes current emotional distress and past actions, but no imminent timeframe for future actions (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die with statements like ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" and ""no point in being alive anymore,"" showing a personal wish not to be alive.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not presented as unwanted or resisted; instead, the desire is present but hindered by lack of bravery. This does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to past attempts (""ive tried"") does not include details of a current plan or method. Without evidence of current planning, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes both current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") and past suicidal actions (""the past two times ive tried ive failed""). The past actions are described as concrete, initiated events that were potentially lethal but failed. According to the rules, if a past attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation, even if no current plan is mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.
   - While there is current ideation, the presence of described past suicidal actions (initiated and potentially lethal) shifts the focus to 'Attempt' per the guidelines.
   - There is no current plan or preparation mentioned, so 'Behavior' does not apply.
   - 'Attempt' is appropriate because the post references specific, self-initiated past actions that failed, fulfilling the definition even alongside current distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" indicating direct suicidal language.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I don't want to be alive"").  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or plans are mentioned. ""Killing myself"" is a general statement without details.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I don't want to be alive""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.  
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I don't want to be alive"").  
   - No, there is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, goodbyes, acquiring means) are present.  
   - Therefore, this leans toward 'Ideation' due to the absence of a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current thoughts and feelings, not past events.  
   - No specific, initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity in desire or unwanted thoughts).  
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.  
   - No past or recent initiated actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - The content fits 'Ideation': explicit desire to die with no plan/method.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""desire to kill myself"" and compares current struggles to past suicidal actions.  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""why bother?""), despair (""I just want out""), and perceived futility (""waste your energy"").  
   - Specific method referenced: ""overdose"" (mentioned in past attempts).  
   - Describes **past actions**: ""attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months.""  
   - Expresses a current desire to die (""I just want out... I'd honestly choose [getting hit by a train]"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""desire to kill myself"" and ""Killing myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""I just want out of that tunnel"").  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan/method/preparation** described. The overdose references are **past actions**, not future plans.  
   - Current suicidal thoughts lack specifics (e.g., ""getting hit by a train"" is metaphorical, not a plan).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions**: Details concrete, potentially lethal acts (""attempted an overdose... twice within the past two weeks"").  
   - These were initiated actions (even if failed/interrupted).  
   - Current content expresses ideation without new behavioral indicators.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No current plan/method/preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **Past initiated, potentially lethal actions** (overdoses) → Triggers *Attempt* category per rules (historic actions take precedence over current ideation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense fear, panic, and distress about potential diabetes, DIY HRT concerns, and family dynamics.  
   - Mentions ""I can't live without estrogen"" in the context of dependency on HRT, not as a literal death wish.  
   - Emotional indicators include feeling ""horrified,"" crying, panic attacks, feeling overwhelmed (""it's just too much""), and fear of parental judgment.  
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**.  
   - The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" reflects desperation about access to HRT, not a desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a clear desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not present**; distress is focused on health anxiety and gender dysphoria.

I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""given up in life""), feeling like a burden (""only keep living so I wouldn't torment my family""), and explicit lack of fear of death (""no hell so I'm not scared to die"").  
   - **Key elements**: Explicit desire to die (implied by lack of fear of death), specific future plan (""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April""), and preparations (note written). No past actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""not scared to die"" combined with hopelessness and a stated plan implies a genuine desire to die. No negation of suicidal thoughts. → **Yes** (desire to die is clear).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""a plan, note and date"" (early April). Preparations (note) and temporal specificity indicate a concrete plan. → **Yes** (plan/preparation present).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""will be in early April""). No mention of past/current initiated actions (e.g., no overdose or self-harm attempt). Focus is on planning, not action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die** is evident (aligns with *Ideation*), but **specific plan/preparations** (note, date) elevate it to *Behavior*. No description of initiated lethal actions (rules out *Attempt*).

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me""), despair (""end up dead in a gutter""), anger/agitation (""ready to explode""), self-harm (""cuts all over myself"").  
   - Plans/preparations: Debating checking into a psychiatric ward or killing oneself, but **no specific method/tool/location** described for suicide (e.g., pills, hanging, bridge).  
   - Imminence: ""Haven't even left home yet"" implies no immediate action.  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""kill myself"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  
   - Past actions: Self-harm (cuts) is mentioned, but no described past *suicidal act* (e.g., overdose, hanging attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases (""kill myself,"" ""go through with it and kill myself"") show a clear personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Mentions ""kill myself"" but lacks details on means (e.g., pills, weapon). The plan to ""walk into an ER"" is a *preventive* action (seeking hospitalization), not a suicide plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Future intention: Debating suicide vs. hospitalization, but no initiated action (e.g., ""I took pills but stopped""). Self-harm (cuts) is noted but is not a potentially lethal suicidal act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts are present, but no specific plan/method for suicide is described. The ER plan is a coping strategy, not a suicide plan. Self-harm is a risk factor but doesn’t constitute a suicide attempt. No past/current potentially lethal action is described.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No mention of tools, locations, or preparations for suicide (e.g., ""I have a gun,"" ""going to the bridge"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/recent initiated suicidal act.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire to die is explicit and personal, ruling out vague distress.

26,"Im so tired i can't kill myself. I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it.

I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""can't kill myself"" indicates direct suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific method/location: ""a good clif"" (cliff) 4-5km away, with accessibility noted (""possible to get there"").
   - Emotional indicators: exhaustion (""so tired""), worthlessness (""not special to anything""), distrust of support (""they insist they care but i dont believe it"").
   - Barrier to action: ""i just can't commit to it,"" indicating hesitation but not negation of desire.
   - No description of past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""tried to jump"" or similar).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""can't kill myself"" is a direct personal expression of suicidal desire. The phrasing focuses on inability to act, not lack of desire. No statement rejects the thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: A specific method (jumping from a cliff) and location (4-5km away) are mentioned. Preparation is implied through knowledge of logistics (""possible to get there"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes current/future intention (""can't kill myself,"" ""can't commit to it"") but **no past/initiated action**. Mentions disclosing suicidality but no self-harm act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (cliff) = **Behavior**. 
   - Hesitation (""can't commit"") doesn’t negate the presence of a plan. 
   - No initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Specificity of method distinguishes this from 'Ideation' (general desire without plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""i have nothing going for me""), despair (""i'm tired of everything""), self-loathing (""tired of hating myself""), and isolation (""tired of not having friends"").  
   - Key phrases: ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" suggest a desire to escape suffering but **do not explicitly mention suicide, death, self-harm, or methods**.  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"" are used.  
   - ""I wish I was never born"" implies regret about existence but **lacks a current, personal desire to actively end life**. It reflects passive ideation (distress about being alive) without explicit suicidal intent.  
   - The primary sentiment is **distress about emotional pain**, not a stated wish to die by suicide.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of tools, locations, substances, plans, or preparations for suicide.  
   - Focus remains on emotional exhaustion, not actionable steps toward self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing feelings** (e.g., ""every night,"" ""everyday"") with **no reference to past or recent suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and passive wishes (e.g., ""never born"") but **lacks explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - Without clear suicidal intent, plan, method, or past action, it aligns with **'Indicator'**: expressions of hopelessness and unwanted life circumstances without current suicidal ideation or behavior.

Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself,"" indicating a direct personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include depression, frustration (""shit show,"" ""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family""), and anger (""one last big fuck you"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""can't wait,"" ""gonna be"") with no reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine wish to die as retaliation, not distress about unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""gonna be [dead at funeral]"" show clear desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: While the funeral is mentioned, it describes a hypothetical consequence, not a method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Future intention (""can't wait,"" ""gonna be"") is stated. No past/recent actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is specified (e.g., ""use a gun,"" ""write a note""). The funeral is a consequence, not a method.  
   - **Attempt**: No initiated action described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits 'Ideation'—clear desire to die but no plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post includes key phrases: ""end it all"" (a direct reference to suicide), ""I'm ready"" (indicating preparedness), ""gonna wait a few weeks"" (future timeline), ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" (mention of a specific method, though unspecified), ""goodbye everybody"" (farewell, suggesting preparation for death), and references to past help-seeking (""all ready tried that before"") which did not involve suicidal actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care"") and isolation.
   - Explicit suicide intent: Yes, ""end it all"" conveys a personal desire to die.
   - Plan/method: The author states they know how they will do it, implying a specific method has been chosen, even if not detailed.
   - Preparation: The farewell (""goodbye everybody"") hints at preparatory behavior, but no concrete actions like acquiring means are mentioned.
   - Temporal context: Future-oriented (""gonna wait a few weeks""); no past or recent suicidal actions described. The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past help-seeking, not a suicide attempt.
   - Desire: Clear wish to die with no indication that thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, ""end it all"" is a direct phrase implying suicide.
   - Yes, the author expresses a genuine desire to die (""I'm finally ready to just end it all"").
   - No, the thoughts are not described as unwanted; the author appears resolved.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a method is briefly mentioned (""I already know how I'm gonna do it""), indicating a specific plan is in place, even if not elaborated.
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described, but the method mention suffices for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intentions (waiting weeks to act). The past reference (""all ready tried that before"") is about seeking help, not a suicidal act. No initiated, potentially lethal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - A specific method is mentioned (""I already know how""), moving this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - The method reference aligns with 'Behavior', as it indicates planning. The farewell supports this but isn't decisive on its own.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit due to the explicit plan/method element.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: ""I can't even fucking kill my self. I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"" (direct reference to suicide and a specific method: cutting with a blade).  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I'm a disappointment,"" ""burden,"" ""They hate me""), worthlessness (""My existence screws up everyone's lives""), and perceived burden (""better off without me"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Explicitly references holding a blade as part of suicidal action.  
   - Imminence: Describes a current struggle (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"").  
   - Desire: Expresses a wish to die (""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"") but notes inability to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly states ""kill my self"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it,"" confirming a genuine desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes: Mentions a specific method (""blade"") and describes holding it, indicating preparation/action toward suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a *current* struggle with initiating self-harm (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""). This is an ongoing behavioral effort (holding the tool) but not a completed or interrupted lethal act. No past attempt is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and method mentioned.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific method (blade) and physical interaction with it (holding) go beyond mere thoughts.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific method + preparation (holding the blade).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a *completed* or *interrupted* lethal action (e.g., cutting). The act of holding the blade is preparatory, not initiated self-harm.

People love plastic, and people love plastic people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""depressed 16 year old,"" feeling unloved by family, societal criticism (""People love plastic"").  
   - Explicit death reference: ""how about i die then, is that what you ask for?""  
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or tools.  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts). Temporal context is hypothetical/accusatory (""is that what you ask for?""), not imminent.  
   - Tone is reactive anger/frustration (directed at family/society), not a stated personal desire to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes** – ""how about i die then"" is an explicit personal reference to dying. However, it’s framed as a rhetorical question blaming others (""is that what you ask for?""), not a direct declaration of personal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No** – No mention of plans, methods, tools, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No** – Describes feelings and hypotheticals (""how about i die""), not past/current actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The death reference (""die"") is explicit but lacks a genuine *personal desire to die* (it’s accusatory).  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent initiated action → rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Ambiguity exists: The phrase ""how about i die"" could be interpreted as passive ideation, but its rhetorical framing and lack of clear suicidal desire lean toward **Indicator** per rules:  
     > *""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""*  
     > *""If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly unwanted/not desired, lean toward Indicator.""*  
   - Here, the author expresses distress and uses death rhetorically to confront others, not to state a personal wish to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no hope,"" ""all is lost,"" ""pointless, meaningless""), resignation (""100% confirmed,"" ""nothing anyone can do"").

   - Past actions: ""At least I DID try"" refers to general life efforts, not a suicide attempt.
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""killing myself will happen,"" ""I will be taking my own life"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life"" indicate a clear, current desire to die. No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No: While suicide is confirmed and timeframe implied (before 2023), no specific method, tools, location, or preparations are described. The statement lacks actionable details (e.g., *how* they plan to do it).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Future intention: The post focuses on a future act (""will happen,"" ""will be taking""). No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I took pills""). ""I DID try"" refers to life efforts, not a suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die rules this out.
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned (only intent and timeframe).
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/initiated lethal action.

   - **No**: Mentions a past ""opportunity"" but no method, tools, location, or preparations described. Current ideation lacks planning elements.

I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress: feelings of weakness, embarrassment, hopelessness (""I know it's never gonna happen""), and self-deprecation (""I'm pathetic"").  
   - Mentions feeling trapped in toxic relationships, betrayal, and low self-worth.  
   - **No references** to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Focuses on interpersonal struggles (friendship betrayal, inability to enforce boundaries) and a desire for normalcy/validation, **not** a wish to die.  
   - Temporal context: Discusses ongoing relational conflict and past attempts to set boundaries (e.g., ""I tried at first""), but these are social actions, **not** self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or similar.  
   - Distress centers on relational pain (""I just want things to be normal"") and self-perceived weakness, **not** a desire to end life.  
   - **Conclusion**: No suicidal intent expressed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations for self-harm.  
   - The ""ultimatum"" refers to a social demand (giving a friend ""two weeks to make things right""), not a suicide plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past social actions** (e.g., trying to cut off friends, giving an ultimatum) and current emotional state.  
   - **No description** of past or recent self-harm, suicide attempts, or preparatory acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: The post shows severe emotional distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) and relational turmoil but lacks any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. The core sentiment is a plea for connection/validation (""I just want him to understand"") and self-criticism, not suicidality.  
   - **Not Ideation/Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of explicit suicidal desire, plans, methods, or past self-harm actions rules out other categories.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feeling hollow, sadness, self-hatred (""I fucking hate myself""), worthlessness (""morally abhorrent piece of crap""), isolation, and hopelessness.  
   - Mentions a desire to escape reality (""transport me to a world of my choosing,"" ""illusion land"") and passive suicidal ideation (""I just want to not exist"").  
   - **Crucially, there is no explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm methods**. Phrases like ""kill myself"" are explicitly framed as metaphorical (""metaphorically, unfortunately"").  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, dying, or active desire to die. The closest phrase is ""I just want to not exist,"" which reflects passive ideation but lacks a clear desire for lethal action.  
   - The metaphorical use of ""kill myself"" is negated by context (""metaphorically, unfortunately""), confirming no genuine intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional suffering but **no past or recent suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and passive thoughts of nonexistence but lacks an explicit personal desire to die, plan, or action.  
   - ""I just want to not exist"" suggests passive ideation, but the absence of explicit suicidal intent or plan aligns more closely with **Indicator** (distress without current personal desire to act).  
   - Per guidelines: If ambiguous about genuine suicidal desire, default to **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key elements**: The post contains intense emotional distress (""losing my mind,"" ""breakdown,"" ""hate myself,"" ""worthless,"" ""tired of being alone"").  
   - **Suicide/death mentions**: Explicit phrases include ""want to end it,"" ""put a bullet right through it,"" ""take my own life,"" ""someone please murder me,"" and repeated declarations of ""i just want to die/i hate being alive.""  
   - **Desire to die**: Strong personal desire is evident (e.g., ""i just want to die"" repeated 9 times).  
   - **Method mentioned**: ""put a bullet right through it"" references a specific method (firearm).  
   - **Preparations/plans**: No mention of acquiring tools, setting a date, writing notes, or concrete steps.  
   - **Past actions**: None described.  
   - **Temporal context**: Expresses current despair but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""take my own life,"" ""put a bullet,"" and ""want to die"" confirm a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: ""put a bullet"" implies a method (firearm).  
   - **No preparation**: No evidence of planning (e.g., accessing a gun, choosing a location) or preparatory actions.  
   - **Ambiguity**: The phrase ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"" suggests the writer feels incapable of acting, weakening the case for imminent behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTIONS**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). Focus is on current feelings.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Specific method (""bullet"") is mentioned**, but:  
     - No concrete plan, preparation, or capability indicated.  
     - The statement ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"" explicitly negates current capacity to act.  
   - **Rules for 'Behavior'**: Require explicit planning/preparation. Absence of these elements leans toward *Ideation*.  
   - **No initiated action** rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Final decision**: *Ideation* (strong desire to die + method reference but no plan/preparation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide watch,"" ""take a bunch of pills,"" ""end it,"" ""better if I was dead.""  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""wasn’t made for life,"" ""can’t keep doing this,"" ""loathe myself""), worthlessness (""contribute nothing,"" ""no talents"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: ""take a bunch of pills while everyone’s asleep"" (method: overdose; timing: when others are asleep).  
   - Stated desire: Expresses genuine wish to die (""subjectively better if I was dead,"" ""wish I could end it"") but conflicted due to fear of pain and impact on mother.  
   - No past actions described—only hypothetical future plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" ""better if I was dead."" Desire is personal and current, not negated as unwanted (fear of pain ≠ lack of desire to die).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""take a bunch of pills"" (overdose).  
   - Specific timing: ""while everyone’s asleep.""  
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring pills), but method and timing constitute a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intention (""could take pills""), not a past/initiated action.  
   - No evidence of concrete past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent (""end it,"" ""better if dead"") rules this out.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - **Ideation** requires desire without plan/method.  
     - **Behavior** requires desire + plan/method/preparation.  
     - Here, *specific method (pills) and timing (while asleep)* constitute a plan, leaning toward **Behavior**.  
   - Conflict (fear, guilt) doesn’t negate the plan’s presence.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post primarily discusses the author's concern about a friend who may be suicidal (""Friend may kill himself soon"").  
   - The author references their **own past experiences**: a serious suicide attempt in 2009 and historical suicidal ideation, but explicitly states they are currently in a ""good place"" with no recent ideation.  
   - **No current personal desire to die** is expressed by the author. Their focus is on their friend's situation and seeking advice.  
   - The author mentions their friend has decided to ""commit suicide at some point in the near future,"" but this describes **another person's risk**, not the author's.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT (AUTHOR)**:  
   - The author does **not** express any current personal desire to die, commit suicide, or end their life.  
   - References to past ideation/attempts are framed as resolved (""I am in a good place now"").  
   - The phrase ""I have been suicidal on-and-off"" describes historical struggles, not current intent.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION (AUTHOR)**:  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned for the author themselves. The only method/preparation discussed relates to their past attempt (2009) or their friend's situation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION (AUTHOR)**:  
   - The author’s only described action is a past attempt (2009), which is historical and not indicative of current risk.  
   - There is **no description of recent or imminent personal suicidal actions** by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses distress about their friend’s situation and reflects on their own mental health history, but **lacks any current personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior**.  
   - Past suicide attempts/ideation do not override the absence of **current** risk indicators.  
   - The core of the post is a request for help/support regarding another person, falling under general distress (""Indicator"").

I'm tired of always being afraid and upset over little things, I'm tired of being a lazy bitch with no motivation. I wish I could be so much better than I am so I didn't live every moment in shame. Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions intrusive thoughts using coded language (""lol kermit sewer slide,"" a clear euphemism for ""commit suicide"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""scared therapy won’t work,"" ""tired of always being afraid,"" ""live every moment in shame"") and feeling like a burden (""lazy bitch with no motivation"").  
   - The writer explicitly references unwanted suicidal thoughts (""I still get the... thoughts"") and describes them as persistent but *tempting*, not desired. They emphasize seeking help (therapy) and wanting improvement (""I wish I could be so much better"").  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or timeline** is mentioned.  
   - **No past actions or attempts** are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, suicidal intent is explicitly referenced indirectly via slang (""kermit sewer slide"").  
   - However, the writer frames these thoughts as **intrusive and unwanted** (""Even on days where I’m actually happy I still get...""), expresses active distress about them, and seeks help to overcome them. The primary sentiment is fear of therapy failing, not a genuine wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **ongoing intrusive thoughts**, not a past or imminent action. No initiated suicidal act is referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned but **characterized as unwanted and distressing** (not a current desire to act).  
   - The absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.  
   - The core focus is **distress about mental state and fear of treatment failing**, with suicidal thoughts presented as symptoms rather than intent. This aligns best with 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts + distress without genuine desire to die).

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains strong expressions of self-hatred (""I hate myself so much,"" ""I'm awful""), hopelessness (""I shouldn't exist,"" ""My life is disgusting""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I want to kill myself so badly""). 
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""jump in front of a train"" with details about the desired outcome (""so I would be in pieces""). 
   - There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions. The author discusses hypotheticals (""if I did kill myself"") and expresses hesitation due to practical concerns (belongings, phone) and self-identified cowardice. 
   - The phrase ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" suggests ambivalence but reinforces current suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes.** Direct phrases include: ""I want to kill myself so badly,"" ""wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train."" The desire to die is personal and current, with no negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes.** A specific method (""jump in front of a train"") and outcome (""be in pieces"") are explicitly stated. Practical barriers (handling belongings) are acknowledged, but no preparations (e.g., writing a note, visiting a location) are described as completed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on **future intentions** (""wish I had the guts,"" ""want to push me to go thru with it""). There are **no descriptions of past/initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to jump"" or ""I went to the tracks""). Hesitation exists, but no interruption of an in-progress act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Explicit desire to die + specific method mentioned** = **Behavior**.  
   - The train-jumping method is concrete and lethal. While the author expresses hesitation, the presence of a plan/method exceeds the threshold for Ideation.  
   - No evidence of an initiated action (Attempt) or ambiguous desire (Indicator).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal desire. 
    - Emotional indicators include intense distress (""i cant breathe""), worthlessness (""im useless""), and perceived burden (""everyone would be better off with me dead""). 
    - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
    - No references to past actions, attempts, or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are present. 
    - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**: The phrase ""I want to kill myself"" is an unambiguous declaration of suicidal intent. 
    - **Yes**: The repetition of self-loathing phrases and the burden statement reinforce a genuine desire to die. 
    - **No**: There is no negation of the desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No method/preparation**: The post lacks references to specific means (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparatory steps. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes current emotional agony but **no past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no mention of attempts). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out **Indicator** (which requires no personal suicidal desire). 
    - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
    - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**. 
    - The core elements align with **Ideation**: explicit personal desire to die without a plan or method.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""confinement mental break down,"" indicating distress. It explicitly references suicidal thoughts with a specific method: ""slitting my wrists."" Emotional indicators include ""growing more depressed and feeling more alone,"" showing hopelessness and isolation. 
   - There is a mention of a past thought (""thought about slitting my wrists today"") but no evidence of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) or action taken (""but i didnt do it""). The temporal context is past (""today""), with no imminent plans stated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is implied by the thought, but it is negated by the lack of action; however, there is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions a suicidal method (""slitting my wrists""), which implies a desire to die. The phrase is personal and direct, indicating suicidal intent from the author. There is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or not desired (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, which relates to a suicidal act. However, this is framed as a thought (""thought about"") with no indication of a current plan, preparations (e.g., obtaining a blade), or intent to act. The method is present, but it is described in the context of ideation rather than active planning or behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past thought (""today"") with no action initiated (""i didnt do it""). There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was started (e.g., no attempt made or interrupted). Thus, this does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific method mentioned, which moves it beyond general distress (Indicator). However, since the method is tied to a thought without evidence of planning, preparation, or imminent action, it aligns with 'Behavior' according to the definition: ""mentions (even if only briefly) a specific method"" in the context of suicidal thoughts. The absence of preparation or a stated plan could cause uncertainty, but the explicit mention of a method (""slitting my wrists"") leans toward 'Behavior'. If there were no method, it would be 'Ideation', but the method is specified. No action was taken, so it is not an 'Attempt'.

I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" as a reaction to dental pain and shame over neglected hygiene during past depression.
   - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm actions, or preparations (e.g., no plans, tools, locations, notes).
   - Emotional indicators: shame, regret, hopelessness (""paying the price,"" ""constant pain"").
   - No stated desire to die; instead, the phrasing frames suicidal feelings as an unwanted recurrence tied to distress over dental issues.
   - No temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"") or descriptions of past/current actions toward suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" references suicidal thoughts but does **not** express a current personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die/kill myself""). The wording implies these feelings are intrusive and linked to a situational trigger (dental pain/shame), not an active wish to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No mention** of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., notes), or locations. The focus is on seeking dental advice to address the physical problem.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes feelings ""coming back"" (historical recurrence), with no indication of imminent intent or past/current suicidal actions. The reference to past depression relates to hygiene neglect, not suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress, shame, and pain, with suicidal feelings framed as an unwanted resurgence. There is **no explicit desire to die**, **no plan/method**, and **no description of suicidal actions**. This aligns with 'Indicator' (distress with passive/unwanted thoughts) rather than 'Ideation' (active desire to die). The ambiguity about genuine current suicidal desire also defaults to 'Indicator' per rules.

If you want more information and are interested in helping, I can explain it better in the chat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes a direct statement: ""i'm someone who wants to die."" This expresses a personal desire to not be alive. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or references to past actions like attempts. The context is primarily a request for help with basic necessities, with the suicide mention explaining why the user can't post in other subreddits. Emotional indicators like hopelessness are implied but not detailed. The desire to die is stated without any indication that it is unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""wants to die"" is an explicit expression of a desire to not be alive, indicating personal suicidal intent. There is no negation or statement that the thoughts are unwanted, so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The focus is on the user's state of mind and their logistical issues, not on planning or acting on suicidal thoughts. This absence of concrete plans or preparations rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current desire (""wants to die"") but no past or recent actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). It is not time-bound (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expression of a desire to die (""wants to die"") without any plan, method, or preparation aligns with 'Ideation'. This is distinct from 'Indicator' because the desire is personal and current, not abstract or unwanted. 'Behavior' is not applicable due to the lack of planning elements, and 'Attempt' is not relevant as no actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" indicating preparation for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include determination (""My minds made up"") and concern for loved ones, but the primary focus is on imminent self-harm.
   - Specific preparations are detailed: seeking help to write suicide notes as part of final arrangements.
   - Imminence is clear (""I'm leaving soon"").
   - The writer explicitly rejects intervention (""Don’t say please don’t go. Stay.""), confirming a genuine desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. References to ""suicide notes"" and ""leaving soon"" (in context) directly imply suicidal intent. The phrase ""goodbye letters"" reinforces this as a final act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. ""Writing suicide notes"" is a recognized preparatory step for suicide, indicating concrete planning. No method is specified, but explicit preparations are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes future intentions (""leaving soon"") and current preparations (writing notes). No past or recent initiated lethal action is mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + active preparations (suicide notes) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: Preparations move this beyond mere desire/thoughts.  
   - Distinction from Attempt: No described past/initiated lethal action.

This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long). currently waiting to see my psychiatrist who I don't trust anymore as I TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul in this entire world anymore because of long history of trauma/ptsd and shit but then bc of trauma from a few days ago that literally I told all the 'professionals' about and they didn't care btw it was them fucking me over (cops physically and verbally abused me, and I told the hospital staff and they didn't care and just watched them continue to do it and took part in some stuff too) I'm fucking done. only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now but bc of my city and it's healthcare system and workers and how they view me bc of how much I struggle with sh/suicidality they just treat me like shit or are done with me. I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide date"" (May 14, 2021), indicating a specific future plan.  
   - References ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" (past actions) and states the only reason they didn't die ""last night"" was due to a desire for help, implying a recent near-lethal action was avoided.  
   - Expresses intense despair (""I'm fucking done,"" distrust of professionals) and a conflict between wanting to live if helped and planning suicide.  
   - Mentions preparations/imminence: ""end things v v soon,"" ""save some flowers for me"" (goodbye gesture).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""suicide date,"" ""end things,"" ""didn’t die last night."" Desire to die is clear despite conflicted feelings.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**. Specific date (May 14, 2021), urgency (""before it""), and implied preparation (""save some flowers"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **past attempts** (""8 yrs of constant attempts"") and **recent avoided action** (""only reason I didn’t die last night"").  
   - The ""last night"" reference indicates a concrete, recent, potentially lethal action was initiated but not completed due to circumstance.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Past/recent actions take precedence: ""last night"" describes an initiated, potentially lethal act (interrupted by the author's conflicted desire for help). This fits **'Attempt'** per the definition (recent, self-initiated action).  
   - While future plans (""suicide date"") suggest 'Behavior', the concrete description of a very recent near-lethal action overrides this.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness, despair, and disillusionment with life (e.g., ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35"").  
   - Mentions a specific age-bound death intention (""I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit"").  
   - References existential distress (""heaven distresses me,"" ""God won’t let me disappear"") and feeling trapped.  
   - No explicit mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author states, ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" in a context of despair, indicating a personal desire to cease existing.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned. The reference to dying by 35 is vague and lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""will die by 35"") but **no description of past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The author explicitly expresses a personal desire to die/disappear (""I want to disappear forever"") and a self-predicted death timeline (""die by 35"").  
   - **Not Indicator**: The desire to die is explicit and current, not abstract or unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to die"").  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan/method/preparation described, and no past/recent lethal actions.  
   - Ambiguity about the ""die by 35"" statement leans toward **Ideation** since it reflects intent without concrete planning.

48,"being fat makes it that much harder to kill yourself. idk if hanging myself would even work, i might just break the shower or the door frame 😂 idk if taking these pills would work, it might be enough to make me sick but not die. I'm trying to die not end up brain damaged. Shits difficult 😎",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions methods of suicide (hanging using the shower or door frame, and taking pills) and expresses a desire to die (""I'm trying to die""). Emotional indicators include frustration and hopelessness about the difficulty of succeeding (""being fat makes it that much harder to kill yourself,"" ""Shits difficult""). There is no mention of specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) or past actions. The emojis (😂, 😎) add a tone of dark humor but do not negate the suicidal content. The focus is on the challenges of methods, not on rejecting suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly mentions ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" and ""trying to die,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to die""). Thus, this is not an 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: hanging (with reference to the shower or door frame) and taking pills. The author discusses the feasibility and potential outcomes of these methods (e.g., ""idk if hanging myself would even work,"" ""idk if taking these pills would work""). This constitutes a consideration of plans and methods, even if the author expresses doubt about effectiveness. No explicit preparations are described, but the mention of methods leans toward 'Behavior' according to the guidelines.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and intentions about suicide methods but no past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""I might just break the shower"" and ""it might be enough to make me sick"" are hypothetical and contemplative, not descriptions of concrete actions taken. Therefore, this does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (""trying to die"") rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of specific methods (hanging and pills) indicates planning, which distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (which lacks methods). Although the author expresses uncertainty about the methods, the guidelines state that any mention of a plan or method leans toward 'Behavior', and uncertainty does not downgrade it to 'Ideation'. There is no description of initiated actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

Everything is so much effort and I want to die, but I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up. I'm just so fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything. I don't want to go and have them tell me what I feel isn't real. I don't even really want to go at all, but I also know its safe and maybe I need that right now? I feel like I can't even think straight anymore, I don't know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""want to die"" (explicit desire) and emotional distress (depressed, numb, sick of everything, hopelessness).  
   - Explicitly states **no specific plan** (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"") and negates intent to act (""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up"").  
   - Focuses on uncertainty about seeking help (psych ward) and fear of not being taken seriously.  
   - No references to methods, tools, locations, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I want to die.""  
   - **But** immediately negates desire to act: ""I'm probably not gonna do anything..."" and frames thoughts as unwanted due to fear of failure.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: Explicitly denies having a plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself""). No methods, tools, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current distress and unwanted thoughts**, no past/ongoing suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - ""Want to die"" suggests *Ideation*, **but** the explicit negation of intent (""not gonna do anything""), lack of plan, and framing of thoughts as distressing/unwanted aligns with **Indicator**.  
   - Rules clarify: If suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted and lack desire/plan, use *Indicator*. Ambiguity about genuine desire also defaults to *Indicator*.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""pills"" repeatedly in the context of counting them nightly and regretting not taking ""them all."" This implies a specific method (overdose) and a recurring preoccupation with it.  
   - Expresses despair (""living a life nobody loves or cares for me"") and self-blame (""coward""), indicating hopelessness.  
   - No explicit past action (e.g., ""I took pills"")—only rumination about inaction.  
   - Temporal context: ""every night"" and ""every day"" suggest ongoing thoughts/rituals.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""take them all"" (pills) strongly implies a lethal intent. The regret (""why am I such a coward"") confirms a *desire to act*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Pills (overdose).  
   - Preparation: ""Counting pills"" nightly is a ritual indicating active planning/rehearsal.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *recurring thoughts* about taking pills but no initiated action (e.g., ""I didn’t take them""). Regret over inaction ≠ an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (via overdose) + specific method (pills) + preparation (counting pills nightly).  
   - Not *Attempt*: No past/current lethal action described.  
   - Not *Ideation*: Plan/method is specified.  
   - Not *Indicator*: Genuine suicidal desire is present.

51,The thoughts have been so unbearably strong lately. Idk why but in the past few months my thoughts have been in a major downward spiral. Everyday waking up and making it through the day is such a struggle for me. I've been keeping this a secret from everyone recently since I don't want to end up in the psych ward again. I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""thoughts"" that are ""unbearably strong"" and in a ""major downward spiral,"" indicating emotional distress, hopelessness, and struggle. It references a history of mental health issues (""end up in the psych ward again"") and secrecy due to fear of hospitalization. There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include despair (e.g., ""struggle,"" ""don't know what to do""), but no clear desire to die is expressed. The temporal context is ongoing (""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""everyday""), with no imminent plans or past actions described beyond the general psych ward reference.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar are used. The ""thoughts"" are not specified as suicidal, and there is no expression of a desire to die or not be alive. The distress about thoughts is present, but without clarification that they are suicidal or unwanted in a suicidal context. The mention of avoiding the psych ward implies distress but does not negate or confirm suicidal desire. Thus, no explicit suicide/death intent is present, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on internal struggle and secrecy, not on actionable steps for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current and recent feelings (e.g., ""lately,"" ""past few months"") with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. The psych ward mention is vague and does not describe a concrete, self-initiated suicidal act (e.g., it could relate to general mental health care). No initiated actions are indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt. Ambiguity exists about the nature of the ""thoughts,"" but without explicit suicidal intent or desire, it falls under 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (no desire expressed), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no described actions).

I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""I can't do this anymore,"" ""feel empty, alone, and uncared for,"" and ""lost all will to live."" 
   - Mentions of death/dying: References ""wanting to die"" indirectly (""it sounds so stupid to want to die"") but frames it as a hyperbolic expression of distress rather than a literal intent. Explicitly states the context is frustration over romantic rejections.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or references to past suicidal actions. Focuses on hopelessness (""I don't think I'll ever find my soulmate"") and emotional pain.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or unambiguous desire to die. The closest is ""want to die,"" but it is immediately downplayed as ""stupid"" and attributed to situational distress. The core sentiment is hopelessness, not a stated wish to act on suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Absent. No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes ongoing emotional pain and hopelessness but no past or imminent suicidal actions. Rejections are past events, but no self-harm is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Expresses severe distress and hopelessness, including a fleeting, abstract reference to ""wanting to die,"" but this is explicitly framed as irrational (""sounds so stupid"") and driven by situational factors. The author does not express a genuine, current desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts. Lacks explicit suicidal intent, plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Fits **Indicator** (distress/hopelessness without personal suicidal desire). Ambiguity leans toward Indicator per rules.

53,what kind of impact will my death have on my mother?. I don't want to live anymore and i cant keep living with depression. i don't want to ruin my mum's mental state when i off myself but i can't continue to live for decades to come.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions death and suicide with phrases like ""what kind of impact will my death have on my mother?"" and ""when i off myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to live anymore""), despair (""i cant keep living with depression""), and a sense of being unable to cope long-term (""i can't continue to live for decades to come""). There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) described. The phrase ""off myself"" is vague and does not indicate a concrete method. No past actions or attempts are mentioned. The temporal context is future-oriented (""when i off myself"") but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer expresses a clear desire to die but also shows concern for their mother, which does not negate the personal suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide with ""off myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die with ""I don't want to live anymore"" and ""i can't continue to live."" The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they reflect a current personal desire. This rules out 'Indicator' and confirms suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. ""Off myself"" is a general term for suicide but lacks detail about how it would be carried out. Without any explicit plan or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses future intentions (""when i off myself"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions. There is no mention of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was attempted, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post has explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I don't want to live anymore""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of current desire). The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior.' With no described past actions, it is not 'Attempt.' Therefore, it best fits 'Ideation' as it involves suicidal thoughts and desire without a clear plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions mental illness, inability to afford treatment or work, financial stress, and lack of energy, leading to feelings of hopelessness (e.g., ""what's the fucking point in any of this"").
   - It explicitly references suicide: ""just killing myself"" is a direct phrase indicating personal suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include despair, helplessness, and a sense of being trapped (e.g., ""i'm going to end up getting fed up... and just killing myself"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""i'm going to end up"") but not immediate (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - The author expresses a desire to die as an inevitable outcome (""what's the point in not""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive, framed as a future inevitability due to distress.
   - No, the suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are presented as a resigned conclusion.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or plan details are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are present.
   - The reference to suicide is general and lacks concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""i'm going to end up"") rather than a past or recent action.
   - There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of a past attempt or recent behavior).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""killing myself"") rules out 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' requires a lack of clear current suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The content fits 'Ideation' because it includes a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, but without any plan, method, or preparation.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements include a mention of depression (""Iam depressed af"") and a direct reference to a past suicidal action (""tried to kms yesterday""). ""kms"" is slang for ""kill myself,"" indicating a specific, self-initiated act. There are no explicit details about methods, means, or preparations, but the phrase ""tried to kms"" implies an action was taken. The temporal context is past (""yesterday""). Emotional indicators like depression and frustration are present, but the core focus is on the described action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself), which is a direct reference to suicide. The phrase ""tried to kms yesterday"" expresses a clear desire to die at that time, as it describes an action taken toward suicide. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author is expressing distress without desire; instead, the action implies intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned in the post. The reference is to a past action (""tried"") rather than current planning. Since the focus is on the action itself, this leans toward 'Attempt' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday."" This indicates a concrete, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, even if it was interrupted, failed, or not completed. The word ""tried"" confirms that an action was initiated. This is a key element for the 'Attempt' category.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post does not fit 'Indicator' because it expresses a personal desire to die through a described action, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts or desire—it describes an actual initiated action.
   - It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no mention of current plans, methods, or preparations; the reference is to a past action.
   - It fits 'Attempt' because it describes a past, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author (""tried to kms yesterday""). According to the rules, if a past attempt is mentioned, 'Attempt' takes precedence, even if current distress is present.

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I cant fight anymore""), despair (""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years""), and a feeling of being overwhelmed to the point of questioning existence (""I cant live anymore""). It mentions ""a non painful way to do this,"" which implies suicide but is vague. Emotional indicators include anhedonia (inability to fight) and perceived burden (punishment from a previous life). No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are described. The phrase ""I cant live anymore"" suggests a personal desire to end life, but it lacks imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I cant live anymore"" is a direct personal expression of a desire not to be alive, indicating suicidal intent. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""), so it leans toward genuine desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan (e.g., location, timing), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to ""a non painful way to do this"" is ambiguous and does not constitute a clear plan or method; it remains at the level of thought.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and a general desire not to live, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interventions, or initiated behaviors). It is solely about present feelings.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""I cant live anymore"" is a personal and explicit desire to not be alive, fitting 'Ideation'. However, there is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The absence of any described past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. The emotional distress is severe but coupled with a clear suicidal desire, so it is not merely an 'Indicator' (which would apply if suicidal thoughts were absent or explicitly unwanted). Since the desire is expressed personally and directly, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself next week with drugs,"" indicating a specific method (drugs) and timeframe (""next week""). It also mentions preparation: ""I just have to write a suicide note for my family."" Emotional indicators include references to family being upset and a sense of resignation (""they are supposed to be remembered anyway""), but the focus is on suicidal intent and planning. There is no mention of past actions or attempts; everything is future-oriented.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (""with drugs"") is mentioned. Additionally, preparation is indicated (""write a suicide note""). This goes beyond mere thoughts and includes concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""next week"") with no mention of any past or recent initiated actions. It discusses planning and preparation but not an action that has been started or completed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a specific method (drugs) and preparation (writing a suicide note) means this cannot be 'Ideation' (which requires no plan/method). Since no action has been initiated (only future plans described), it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a plan and preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions extreme fatigue (""i'm always tired""), hopelessness (""life is so cyclic""), lack of motivation, isolation (""it's so lonely""), regret over interpersonal conflicts, and frustration with ineffective treatment (""none of the pills do enough"").  
   - References financial stress, academic pressure, and envy of others' lives.  
   - Key phrase: ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" This suggests a desire to end suffering but **lacks explicit suicide/death terminology** (e.g., no ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - No mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., note-writing), or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - ""Get this over with"" implies a wish to end distress but **does not explicitly state a desire to die** or commit suicide. The phrase is ambiguous (could mean ending life or enduring hardship).  
   - No expression of *unwanted* suicidal thoughts; the focus is on emotional exhaustion.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned. The phrase ""get this over with"" is vague and unspecific.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing struggles, **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no reference to attempts, aborted actions, or self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and weariness with life but **lacks a clear, personal desire to die** or explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Ambiguous phrasing (""get this over with"") leans toward **general distress** rather than active suicidal ideation, especially without a plan/method.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Dominant themes are hopelessness and burden, not a stated wish for death. Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'/'Attempt'; absence of explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Ideation'.  
   - **Rule application**: When ambiguous about suicidal desire, default to 'Indicator'.

59,"I finally went through. I regret everything that led me to this point. I have overdosed. I regret it. I also don't. I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over. I took 500mg Zoloft, so it won't kill me, but it'll punish me for being such a nuisance to society. It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit. I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I have overdosed"" and specifies taking ""500mg Zoloft,"" indicating a self-harm method. Emotional indicators include regret, suffering, feeling like a ""nuisance to society,"" and conflicting desires (e.g., ""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over""). The action is described as already initiated (""I took 500mg Zoloft""), with current symptoms like a headache. The user explicitly states no desire to die, but the overdose is a concrete, recent action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, it expresses a desire for suffering to end, not a clear wish to die (""I don't want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned; instead, the focus is on the action taken. The negated desire (""I don't want to die"") could lean toward 'Indicator', but the overdose action shifts the focus to behavior.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned (""overdosed,"" ""took 500mg Zoloft""), and the action has been carried out, indicating preparation and initiation. This goes beyond mere planning, pointing to 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past/recent action: ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" with symptoms occurring now. This is a self-initiated, potentially harmful act (even if deemed non-lethal by the user). The action is concrete and initiated, aligning with 'Attempt' (e.g., similar to ""I took pills but woke up"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The overdose is a specific, initiated action, making it more than 'Ideation' (which lacks action) or 'Behavior' (which involves planning but not initiated action). The user's ambivalence (e.g., ""I regret it. I also don't"") and stated lack of death desire do not negate the fact that a potentially lethal act was attempted. Past/recent actions take precedence, so 'Attempt' fits best per the definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... even if interrupted or failed."" Here, the action was taken, and its non-lethal outcome doesn't change the classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: ""I'm doing it in the near future"" (implies imminent action), ""knowing I'm going to"" (certainty), ""ready to go"" (preparedness).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel so at peace"" (resignation/resolve, not distress).  
   - Specific plans/methods: No explicit method (e.g., pills, weapon), location, or preparation (e.g., note, means) mentioned. ""It"" is a euphemism likely for suicide but lacks concrete details.  
   - Imminence: ""near future"" suggests urgency but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: Clear intent (""I'm going to,"" ""ready to go"") without ambivalence or rejection of suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""doing it"" and ""ready to go"" strongly imply a self-referential desire to die. The certainty (""knowing I'm going to"") confirms intent. **Yes** (implied desire to die).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method (tools, substances), location, or preparatory steps (e.g., note, acquiring means) specified. ""Spent time with favourite person"" may hint at farewell but isn’t explicit preparation. **No plan/method identified**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""near future""). No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). **Not an attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit personal desire to die is implied, and distress isn’t the focus.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes: Clear desire to die (""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go"") but no plan/method.  
   - **Behavior?** No: Lacks specific plan/method/preparation (e.g., ""using pills,"" ""going to bridge"").  
   - **Attempt?** No: No initiated action described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses a past experience from four years ago when the author was identified as suicidal by their high school.  
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""counselors suck,"" ""what the hell"") but no current despair, hopelessness, or desire to die.  
   - Mentions being suicidal *in the past* but frames it as a resolved/historical issue (""it was 4 yrs ago"").  
   - No references to current suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or imminent actions.  
   - Focuses on criticizing the school's response, not expressing personal current distress or intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal ideation (""i was suicidal""), but **no explicit current desire to die or self-harm**. The phrasing distances the author from that state now (e.g., ""4 yrs ago"").  
   - No indication of *unwanted* current suicidal thoughts; the reference is entirely retrospective.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, or preparations mentioned** for past or present actions. The post only references the school discovering past ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past event** (school response to historical ideation).  
   - **No description of a past or recent suicidal action** (e.g., no mention of an attempt). Only ideation (""was suicidal"") is referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses frustration but lacks **current personal desire to die** → rules out *Ideation*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned → rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No initiated lethal action described → rules out *Attempt*.  
   - References past suicidal ideation abstractly (as a contextual fact) while focusing on systemic criticism → fits **Indicator** (discusses suicide indirectly without current intent or distress).  
   - Ambiguity about past desire vs. current state leans toward *Indicator* per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains direct questions about suicide: ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and explicit statements like ""Might as well just die.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), despair (""unexplainable void and sadness""), self-loathing (""pretty shit person""), and isolation.  
   - Mentions suicidal thoughts as persistent but attributes them to a ""chemical imbalance.""  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations** are described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no reference to initiating self-harm).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""die."" The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""Might as well just die"") without negating it.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned. The suicidal thoughts are general, with no concrete steps or means described.

   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned rules out *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""i should die,"" ""kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), burden perception (""my family doesn't need to raise trash""), self-loathing (""sucking at everything""), isolation (""no friends"").  
   - Plan/preparation: ""I have prepared everything"" (directly stated).  
   - Temporal context: Past intent (""made up my mind a few days [ago]"") and current preparation (""I have prepared everything"").  
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (e.g., ""i should die,"" ""kill myself"") without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" and ""i should die"" are direct expressions of desire to die. No indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I have prepared everything"" explicitly indicates concrete preparations for suicide, even without method details.

   - **No initiated lethal action described** (e.g., no mention of starting/attempting the plan).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** base).  
   - **Preparation (""prepared everything"") elevates to Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""vanish without a trace"" and ""no one will find my body,"" implying death.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), feeling burdensome (""they never seemed to enjoy my company"").  
   - **Specific method**: ""pistol"" for suicide; **preparations**: Emptying bank account, leaving belongings, planning to walk to a secluded spot with only essentials.

   - **Desire**: Explicit wish to die (e.g., ""vanish"" linked to undiscovered body).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit statement: ""I want to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is shit,"" ""we all just fake it till we die""), despair (""I give up now""), isolation (""no one cares""), and identity crisis (""I don't recognise myself anymore"").

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal for about 10 years"" and references a potential future action with ""when i do do it,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts and intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i dont want the existance ive got""), despair (""i feel like im just rotting away""), feeling disconnected, and being a burden on others.
   - Specific plans/preparations are described: the user has ""decided the woodland where i would do it"" and plans to ""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers."" This shows consideration of a method and location, as well as steps to manage the aftermath.
   - References to past actions include historical self-harm (e.g., scratching and punching as a child) and help-seeking (e.g., hotlines, doctors), but no concrete, initiated suicidal actions are described. The user states, ""ive not gone and got a rope,"" confirming no recent preparations or attempts.
   - Imminence is implied with ""im on the edge"" and triggered by events, but the user also acknowledges the feelings are temporary (""i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks""), reducing immediacy.
   - The desire to die is present (""i dont want the existance ive got""), but there is ambivalence due to concerns about others and a stated intent to seek help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal"" and implies a desire to die with phrases like ""when i do do it"" and ""i dont want the existance ive got."" Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are described as persistent, with planning elements.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific plan is mentioned: the ""woodland"" location and the method of leaving notes to warn others. Preparations include pushing people away to facilitate the act. This goes beyond general ideation and constitutes planning behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing suicidal thoughts and future intentions but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. Historical self-harm is noted, but it is not described as a suicide attempt. The planning (e.g., deciding on the woodland) is prospective, not an action that has been carried out.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts rule out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a specific plan (woodland location and notes) and preparations (pushing people away) elevates it beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of an actual attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent with stated plans and preparations.

   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal"" and includes emotional indicators like feeling ""desperate,"" ""hopeless,"" and expressing a sense of isolation (""no one cares,"" ""no one to help me stay alive""). It references a specific timeframe with ""tonight's the night I guess,"" indicating imminence. There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions initiated (e.g., a prior attempt). The desire to die is implied through phrases like ""help me stay alive"" and ""no one will miss me,"" but there is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., stating they don't want to act on them).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and implies a desire to die through ""tonight's the night"" and ""help me stay alive,"" which suggests a current personal wish to not be alive. There is no statement indicating these thoughts are unwanted or that the author resists acting on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, jumping, or goodbyes). The phrase ""tonight's the night"" indicates temporal imminence but lacks concrete details about how the act would be carried out. Without an explicit plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. The reference to calling a hotline is a help-seeking behavior, not a suicidal act. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was started.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""tonight's the night""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of explicit suicidal intent). However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. Since no past or recent suicidal action is described, it cannot be 'Attempt'. Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts with desire but no actionable plan.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions a method: ""cutting an artery"" and using ""oxy"" (likely OxyContin) to reduce pain during the act. 
   - The phrasing (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain a lot when cutting an artery?"") indicates a practical inquiry about facilitating a suicidal act. 
   - The author expresses distress about having no one else to ask, but the core focus is on optimizing a method. 
   - There is no mention of past actions, preparations, or temporal immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. The post directly references a lethal method (cutting an artery) in a first-person context, implying a personal desire to die. The question presupposes intent to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. A specific method (""cutting an artery"") and a means to facilitate it (""oxy"") are explicitly mentioned. The question centers on refining the method’s effectiveness.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No past or recent initiated action is described. The post discusses a hypothetical/future scenario (""*wouldn't* taking oxy lessen the pain""), not a completed or interrupted attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses suicidal intent and details a specific method (artery cutting + oxy), satisfying the criteria for **Behavior**. 
   - There is no evidence of a past or ongoing attempt (e.g., ""I tried this yesterday""), ruling out 'Attempt'. 
   - The specificity of the method distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (general desire without plan).

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses a friend's prediction that the author will die by suicide, which has caused emotional distress. The author expresses hurt, feelings of betrayal, and relationship conflict, but there is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, self-harm, or specific methods from the author. Key elements include:
     - Mentions of suicide only appear in quoted statements from the friend (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""), not as the author's own intent.
     - Emotional indicators focus on feeling hurt, undervalued, and conflicted about the friendship, with no signs of hopelessness, despair, or personal suicidal ideation.
     - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for suicide are expressed by the author.
     - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts by the author; instead, the author emphasizes fighting mental illness (BPD and CPTSD).
     - The author's stated desire is to seek advice on handling the interpersonal issue, not to express any wish to die. The tone is one of seeking validation and coping strategies.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No, the author does not explicitly mention personal suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or phrases like ""kill myself"" in a self-referential context. Suicide is discussed only as a hurtful comment from the friend, and the author explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" indicating no personal desire for suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No, there is no mention of any plan, method, tool, location, or preparation for suicide by the author. The only references to suicide are external (from the friend) and not actionable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past conversation and ongoing emotional fallout, but there is no description of any initiated suicidal action (past or present) by the author. The focus is on the friend's words and the author's reaction, not on personal behaviors or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows general distress about a relationship and mental health struggles, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. Mentions of suicide are abstract and attributed to another person, with the author actively distancing themselves from it. This aligns with 'Indicator', which covers distress or discussions about suicide without personal intent. It does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (no desire to die expressed), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no described actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post describes the author being at a window with scissors, feeling like they are about to cut the screen and jump out. There is a plea for help (""please please please help me""), expressions of helplessness (""i dont know what to do""), and context about being a teen with family asleep.
   - Emotional indicators: High distress, despair, and a sense of immediacy (""right now,"" ""im about to"").
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: Jumping out of a window is a specific, potentially lethal method for suicide. Scissors are mentioned as a tool to facilitate this action (cutting the screen).
   - Specific plans/methods: The method (jumping out) and means (scissors) are explicitly stated. Preparation is indicated by being at the location with the tool in hand.
   - Imminence: The phrases ""right now"" and ""im about to"" convey immediate risk.
   - Stated desire: While there is no explicit phrase like ""I want to die,"" the description of impending action implies a current personal risk. The plea for help suggests ambivalence but does not negate the suicidal intent indicated by the behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, the action described (jumping out of a window) is inherently suicidal and implies a desire to die. The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them; instead, they express being on the verge of acting. Thus, this is not a case of unwanted thoughts alone, so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (jumping out after cutting the screen) and means (scissors) are mentioned. The author is actively preparing (""im at my window right now with scissors""), indicating they are in a state of readiness to act. This presence of method and preparation aligns with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current, imminent intention (""im about to"") but no past or initiated action. The author has not yet cut the screen or jumped; they are expressing an impending act. Therefore, this does not qualify as 'Attempt' (which requires an initiated, potentially lethal action).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') because it includes a personal, imminent suicidal plan with specific details.
   - It exceeds 'Ideation' (desire without plan) due to the explicit mention of method (jumping) and preparation (being at the window with scissors).
   - It does not meet 'Attempt' because no action has been initiated (e.g., no description of cutting or jumping having occurred).
   - The presence of a plan, method, and preparation fits the 'Behavior' category. The plea for help does not change the classification, as the focus is on the expressed suicidal behavior.

Final decision: 'Behavior' is the most appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific method: ""overdose on iron pills.""  
   - Expresses emotional distress: ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it.""  
   - States a future intention: ""i'm gonna overdose..."" (implicitly imminent).  
   - No indication of past actions or preparations beyond the stated plan.  
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to do this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Overdose"" implies a lethal self-directed act. The phrase ""i'm gonna overdose"" expresses clear intent to die to escape pain.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A specific method (""overdose on iron pills"") is explicitly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""gonna"") with a specific method.  
   - No mention of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method mentioned → Rules out *Indicator* (no desire) and *Ideation* (no plan).  
   - No description of an initiated past/recent action → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Behavior*: Suicidal intent with a plan/method (iron pills).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""im going to kill myself one day"" and expresses intense despair, hopelessness (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), and a desire to escape (""i just want to disappear... run away to a forest and fucking die"").  
   - Mentions specific life stressors (deferred from dream school, abusive parents, social isolation, bullying).  
   - No specific suicide method, plan details, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or imminent timeline like ""tonight"").  
   - No past suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  
   - The desire to die is personal and current (""i just want to... die""), but the only deterrent is a slim hope for future escape via college.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""im going to kill myself one day"" and ""i just want to... fucking die.""  
   - The desire to die is not framed as unwanted/intrusive thoughts; it’s expressed as a genuine wish.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While ""run away to a forest and fucking die"" implies a vague method (exposure/starvation?), it lacks specificity. No mention of acquiring means, researching methods, or concrete preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""one day"") and current distress. No description of past/initiated suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out—no plan/method/preparation details.  
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out—no past/recent initiated actions.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best—clear desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""fucking die"") with no plan/method. The deterrent (college hope) doesn’t negate the expressed suicidal intent.

I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and a persistent desire to die. Key elements include:
   - Explicit mentions of suicidal ideation (""kill myself,"" ""end it all"") but with a stated inability to act (""don't have the heart/bravery"").
   - Strong desire for death via external means (""hoping to be murdered,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me"").
   - Emotional indicators: despair (""losing more hope""), anhedonia (""numb to all emotion""), self-loathing (""useless,"" ""defective""), and recurrent crying.
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools/locations for self-harm), or preparations (e.g., notes) by the author. The reference to ""walk[ing] through sketchy areas"" reflects passive hope for murder, not active planning for self-harm.
   - No description of past or imminent self-initiated suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, the author explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""end it all,"" confirming a desire to die.
   - However, they **explicitly negate personal action** (""don't have the heart/bravery""), framing their desire as passive (""hoping to be murdered"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**. While death is desired, there is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation for self-initiated suicide. The wish for murder/assisted suicide relies on external factors.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes ongoing emotional suffering but **no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempt to overdose, jump, etc.). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a **genuine desire to die** (suicidal ideation) but explicitly **rejects personal agency** due to fear/cowardice. 
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** for self-harm is present. 
   - The passive hope for death via murder/assisted suicide does not constitute a plan or behavior initiated by the author. 
   - Thus, this aligns with **Ideation** (explicit desire to die without a specific plan/preparation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes explicit mentions of death/dying (""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""See you all on the other side"") and strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I always felt unwanted,"" ""8,000 days of this shithole,"" ""I can't take no more"").
   - There is no specific mention of suicide methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., previous attempts).
   - The temporal context implies future intention (""I think I'm going to leave,"" ""See you all on the other side""), but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete plan is stated.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""glad I'm going to die"") without indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly conveys a personal desire to die through statements like ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" and ""See you all on the other side."" There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit intent is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. Phrases like ""I think I'm going to leave"" and ""See you all on the other side"" are vague and lack concrete details about how the act would be carried out. With no plan or preparation indicated, this leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions and general despair, with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). The reference to ""8,000 days"" reflects on life lived, not a countdown to action. Thus, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a clear personal desire to die, placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire). However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. Per the rules, if no plan/method is present, 'Ideation' is appropriate. The writer's intent is explicit but not actionable, fitting the 'Ideation' definition (e.g., ""I want to die"" equivalents without a plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including sadness, anxiety, depression, hopelessness (e.g., ""tired of only feeling sadness,"" ""tired of being a burden,"" ""my soul is hurting""), and feelings of being overwhelmed (e.g., ""I don't think I can do it anymore""). It references unsuccessful coping mechanisms (medications, inebriation) and external stressors (abusive mother, unsupportive relationships). The phrases ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""wave the white flag"" suggest a desire to escape suffering but do not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances for suicide), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past suicidal actions are described. The emotional tone is one of despair and exhaustion, with a stated desire for happiness (""I still want happiness"") indicating ambivalence rather than a clear wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent). The desire expressed (""don't wanna be here"") is vague and contextualized as fatigue from emotional pain, not a clear statement of wanting death. The author explicitly states a continued desire for happiness, which leans against genuine suicidal intent. Therefore, suicidal thoughts, if implied, are not confirmed as a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No indication of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. References to medications and inebriation are about treatment or coping, not means for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing struggles and past attempts at coping/treatment (e.g., ""tried every antidepressant,"" ""tried every way to cope""), but no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no initiated self-harm or attempts). All content relates to current emotional states, not concrete suicidal behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, or action. Phrases like ""don't wanna be here"" and ""wave the white flag"" are ambiguous and could reflect general despair rather than active suicidal ideation. Given the absence of explicit suicidal intent and the rule to choose 'Indicator' in cases of ambiguity, this aligns with 'Indicator'. It does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (which requires clear desire to die) or higher categories due to no plan/behavior or past attempt.

   - The explicit desire to die (""I have to kill myself"") places this beyond *Indicator* (which lacks personal suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past/initiated lethal action rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The author expresses a wish to ""donate my life"" to someone else's deceased mother, explicitly states ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" and links this to making others happy. No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I don't deserve, nor want to live""), despair, and self-sacrificial ideation (prioritizing another's life over their own).  
   - Plans/methods/preparations: No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The ""donate life"" concept is abstract and metaphorical.  
   - Past actions: No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - Desire: The author clearly states a personal desire to not be alive (""I don’t want to live"") but frames it altruistically.

   - No explicit use of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct synonyms.

   - Describes a current wish/desire, not a past or recent action. No initiated suicidal act (e.g., no mention of trying to harm themselves).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (""I don’t want to live""), placing this beyond **Indicator** (which requires no genuine desire to die).

I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds. I'm quitting therapy. Talk about a waste of time and energy. Fuck weight loss. Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon,"" expressing a clear desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""healing is a joke,"" ""family is a joke""), despair (""tired of it""), and anhedonia (abandoning therapy/meds).  
   - Specific actions: Stopping antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and blood pressure meds; quitting therapy; embracing unhealthy habits (soda/junk food) to hasten death.  
   - References to means: Implied method via self-neglect (stopping meds + unhealthy lifestyle) and hoping to contract COVID as a passive lethal means.  
   - No explicit past suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"")—only current/future intentions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" show a personal, current desire to die. No negation of this desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Stopping critical medications (antidepressants, BP meds) and quitting therapy are concrete preparations that could hasten death. Hoping for COVID as a lethal agent implies a method (passive self-harm via illness).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""stopping all my meds today,"" ""quitting therapy""). No past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I took pills""). Actions are preparatory, not initiated attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**not Indicator**).  
   - Preparations/methods present (stopping meds, embracing harmful habits, hoping for COVID) → **Behavior**.  
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action → **not Attempt**.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements include expressions of emotional distress: ""I just want to disappear"" and ""to be free from all this pain."" There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""free from all this pain""), but there is no reference to plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or imminence. The desire expressed is for relief from suffering, not an explicit wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""disappear"" is vague and could imply a metaphorical escape rather than a literal desire for death. There is no clear statement of a genuine wish to die (e.g., ""I want to be dead""). The focus is on ending pain, not on suicidal intent. Since suicidal thoughts or death are not explicitly mentioned or desired, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The absence of any planning element supports 'Indicator' or 'Ideation', but without explicit suicidal desire, it aligns more with 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings of distress with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no mention of an initiated suicide attempt). It also lacks future intentions with concrete steps. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and a desire to escape pain but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. Phrases like ""disappear"" are ambiguous and could indicate emotional turmoil without suicidal ideation. Since there is no explicit wish to die, no plan, and no action, it fits 'Indicator'. If there were any doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', the guidance is to choose 'Indicator' when suicidal desire is ambiguous or not explicitly stated.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""plan for suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators include distress and a direct question about reasons not to commit suicide, implying internal conflict but not explicitly stating hopelessness or despair.
   - There is no specific method, tool, location, or substance mentioned (e.g., no details on how they would kill themselves). The phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" indicates an intention to formulate a plan but does not describe an existing plan or preparation (e.g., no notes, means acquisition, or goodbyes).
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors are present.
   - Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""); the ""Goodnight"" is a sign-off unrelated to suicide timing.
   - The writer expresses a desire to die through the rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" and the need for a plan, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" showing clear personal suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., questioning reasons against suicide implies openness to the idea).
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no ""I don't want to die""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no notes, acquiring means, or farewells). The statement ""I just need a plan"" confirms the absence of a current plan and is aspirational rather than descriptive of existing preparations.
   - Since no plan or preparation is present, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and future intentions (e.g., needing a plan) but no past or recent actions.
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, even if interrupted or failed) are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""plan for suicide""), placing it beyond 'Indicator', which requires no clear desire.
   - However, the lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior' (e.g., ""I need a plan"" is not equivalent to having one).
   - No past or recent actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - This aligns with 'Ideation': explicit desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no plan or preparations.

Final Classification: 'ideation' best fits, as the core elements are desire and thoughts without concrete planning.

82,"I need to find someone who relates. Does anyone else find themselves almost uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself""? I say other things like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to my most recent failed attempt) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"". It's almost like Tourettes but I know it's not. I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (referencing a ""most recent failed attempt""), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and a description of putting a finger gun in the mouth to simulate suicide. Emotional indicators include distress about uncontrollable thoughts and seeking relatability (""Does anyone else relate?"", ""am I crazy?""). There is a clear reference to a past suicidal action (""failed attempt""). No specific future plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for current intent; the finger gun gesture is described as a compulsive behavior, not a plan. The temporal context focuses on past events (the attempt) and current intrusive thoughts/behaviors, with no imminent timeline for future action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and references a past suicide attempt, indicating a historical desire to die. However, the current uncontrollable utterances (""I'm going to kill myself"") are framed as intrusive and distressing (like ""Tourettes""), which may suggest they are not fully endorsed as a current desire. But the writer does not explicitly negate the desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""), so explicit intent is present historically and in the phrasing.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for a future suicide is described. The finger gun gesture simulates a method but is presented as a compulsive behavior, not part of a plan. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is vague and part of uncontrollable speech, not a detailed plan. The only concrete method/preparation reference is tied to the past attempt.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: a ""failed attempt"" (implied by ""I wish I stayed in the car""), which was a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was not completed. This meets the 'Attempt' definition. Current content involves expressions of suicidal thoughts and compulsive behaviors, but no initiated action is described for the present or future.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The reference to a ""most recent failed attempt"" is a clear, concrete past suicidal action that was potentially lethal, fitting the 'Attempt' category definition. This takes precedence over current ideation or behavior, as per the rules. While there are expressions of suicidal thoughts and compulsive behaviors (which could lean toward 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'), the past attempt is explicitly described and dominates the classification. There is no ambiguity about the past action being an actual attempt (not just thinking about it). Thus, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal.""

   - Describes lifelong trauma (abuse, bullying) and current distress.  
   - No reference to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - The desire to die is personal and current, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or imminent timelines.  
   - Focuses on emotional pain and structural barriers (e.g., lack of money for surgery), not actionable plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes historical abuse and ongoing distress, **no** reference to initiated suicidal actions (past or recent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: ""endless torment,"" isolation, feeling unheard, hopelessness about the future (""Is this my life now?"").  
   - Explicit suicidal desire: ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.""  
   - No specific method, plan, timeline, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, notes).  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - Focuses on current despair and a stated preference for death over ongoing suffering.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself"" as a personal desire. The phrase ""I'd rather kill myself now"" expresses a clear wish to die to escape pain.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/plan**: While suicidal intent is explicit, no tools, locations, substances, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase is a declaration of preference, not a concrete plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No past/recent actions**: Describes emotional pain but no initiated self-harm or suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (""kill myself""), ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of method/preparation/plan rules out *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger."" These directly reference suicide and a specific method (firearm).
   - Emotional indicators: Fear (""I'm scared""), conflict about leaving pets/friends, persistent urges (""every single day I still have the urge""), hopelessness (""I'm too much of a pussy to just pull the trigger"").
   - Method specified: Firearm (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").
   - No preparations mentioned (e.g., no note, accessing a gun, or location plans).
   - No past actions: Explicitly states inability to act (""I can never bring myself to actually do it"").
   - Desire: Expresses a wish to die (""I want to kill myself"") but is conflicted due to fear/attachments.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""blow my brains out"" show a personal desire to die. The conflict (fear/attachments) doesn't negate the expressed desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Method mentioned: Firearms (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").  
   - No evidence of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) or imminent timeline.  
   - Method alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' without explicit planning/preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes ongoing urges and thoughts but explicitly denies action (""can never bring myself to actually do it"").  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no attempt to use the method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") and a method is referenced, but there is no indication of planning/preparation (e.g., securing a gun, choosing a time/location). The conflict and inaction reinforce this.  
   - Not 'Indicator': Suicidal desire is explicit and personal.  
   - Not 'Behavior': No plan/preparations beyond mentioning a method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct phrases like ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" and ""end my horrible life,"" indicating a strong desire for death. Emotional indicators include ""horrible life"" and ""i beg of you,"" showing despair and desperation. There is a specific plan implied: the author offers to DM their address to facilitate being murdered, which serves as both a method (murder by another person) and a preparation (providing location details). No past actions are mentioned; the focus is on immediate future intent (""please come here,"" ""i'll dm"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my horrible life."" The author personally wants to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (being murdered) is mentioned, and a preparation (DMing the address) is offered. This constitutes a plan to carry out the suicidal intent, even though the method involves external action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""i'll dm,"" ""please come here"") but no past or recent initiated actions. There is no description of a concrete, self-initiated lethal act that was carried out, so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator.' The presence of a specific method (murder) and preparation (sending address) elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which requires no plan/method). As no actual action has been initiated, it is not 'Attempt.' Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post includes both suicidal desire and elements of planning/preparation.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions significant distress: job insecurity, family issues, isolation, hopelessness (""I don't see a way out""), and passive death-related thoughts (""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"").  
   - Explicitly negates suicidal action: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a desire to die.  
   - Death is mentioned passively (""I haven't been afraid of dying"") but framed as *unwanted* (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen""). The phrase ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" suggests hopelessness, not active suicidal desire.

   - **None present**. No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress but **no past/current suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is hopelessness and passive ideation (e.g., ""things would be better if I didn't have to try""), but the author explicitly rejects acting on it. This aligns with 'Indicator' due to the absence of a personal desire to die and the clear negation of intent. Vague references to death/dying without suicidal intent further support this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep emotional distress (""crushed and empty,"" ""back to square one""), hopelessness (""can't keep getting false hope""), and explicitly mentions escalating ""suicidal thoughts."" The author references a desire to escape (""erase my memories,"" ""collapse and let go"") but does not describe any specific suicide method, plan, preparation, or past/current self-injurious actions. The phrase ""help me please"" and the acknowledgment of intermittent hope (""maybe I can power through"") suggest ambivalence about acting on suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. The author explicitly states ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" confirming personal suicidal ideation. The context of despair (""i just want to collapse and let go"") reinforces a desire to escape suffering, though the plea for help complicates intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No. There is no mention of a plan (e.g., time, method, tools), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or suitable locations. The focus is on internal thoughts and emotional pain.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: No. The post describes escalating thoughts and distress but no past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). References to ""false hope"" and past neutral feelings are emotional reflections, not behavioral reports.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts with a desire to escape suffering (""I just want to collapse"") align with **Ideation**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - Absence of initiated self-harm actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress and hopelessness are present, explicit personal suicidal thoughts move this beyond **Indicator**. The plea for help does not negate the expressed desire linked to suicidal ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit mention of suicide: ""planning to kill myself tonight.""
    - Temporal context: Imminent (""tonight"").
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Everyone who could help me is asleep""), isolation (""my problem, my illness""), and farewell (""Rest In Peace ya'll"").
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) or concrete preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.
    - No description of past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Explicit statement: ""kill myself"" confirms a current, personal desire to die. The writer does not express these thoughts as unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - A plan is implied by ""tonight,"" indicating timing/intent to act imminently. However, no specific method, tools, locations, or concrete preparations are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Focuses on future intent (""tonight""). No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and imminent timing (""tonight"") surpass the threshold for 'Indicator'. 
    - The absence of a specific method/preparation means it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. The implied plan (timing) is insufficient without method details; per rules, ""if unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"". 
    - No past/recent concrete suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' is ruled out. 
    - Thus, **'Ideation'** fits best: explicit desire to die with future intent but no plan/method/preparation details.

   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""I’m starting to think""), not past actions.  
   - **No initiated action**: No reference to past/current concrete suicidal acts (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""suicide is the only thing,"" ""I need to leave"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated.  
   - **Not Behavior**: Absence of specific plans/methods rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated actions.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal; not abstract/unwanted thoughts.

No one is going to convince me otherwise. But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""hanging myself"" as the method, and the author discusses ""practicing"" this method, including past actions (""I practiced"") and future intentions (""I'm going to keep practicing""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""My life is fucked now,"" ""There's no turning it around""), worthlessness (""I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die""), and anhedonia except for thoughts of death (""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy""). The author expresses a strong desire for death as relief (""I take great solace knowing that this pain... will be over soon"") and actively resists intervention (""I don't want anyone to take this away from me""). Preparations are evident through repeated practice to overcome survival instincts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly mentions ""hanging myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""I will succeed""). The suicidal thoughts are not portrayed as unwanted; instead, they are embraced and associated with happiness.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (hanging) is mentioned, and there are clear signs of preparation, including past practice (""I practiced""), ongoing training (""I'm going to keep practicing, train myself""), and intent to overcome physiological barriers (""break this natural survival instinct""). This indicates active behavioral steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references past actions (""I practiced"") and future intentions (""I will succeed""). The past action of practicing hanging is a self-initiated behavior, but it is framed as preparation (training to build tolerance) rather than a concrete, potentially lethal suicide attempt (e.g., no indication it was interrupted or failed due to lethality). The primary focus is on future plans, with no description of a past event where death was imminent or attempted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire and thoughts (leaning toward 'Ideation'), but the presence of a specific method (hanging) and detailed preparations (practicing and training) shifts this to 'Behavior'. The past practice is part of the preparation process, not a described suicide attempt (as it lacks elements of initiation with lethal intent or interruption). There is no ambiguity about the desire to die, and 'Behavior' fits due to the planning elements. Rules emphasize that if a plan/method is present, it is 'Behavior', and if unsure, default to 'Ideation'—but here, the plan and preparation are explicit.

92,"Snapped at my dog. I know i'm a piece of shit. My dog is 14. She always barks and growls at me if i walk by when someone else is eating. My family always says its because she sees me as 'weak' because i was scared of dogs when we first got her. That makes me feel like absolute shit and its all i can think of every time this happens. Tonight it happened twice. the first time i screamed at her to shut up and the second time i screamed i would kill her and whipped a blanket at her. My mom was there and she said i scared her. I feel like one day i will hurt someone i care about. I dont want to get into any relationships (not that i would anyway) because i can snap like this.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense guilt, self-loathing (""piece of shit""), fear of harming others (""one day i will hurt someone""), and hopelessness (""I want to die. I want to disappear""). 
    - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I want to die"" and ""one day i will take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone"" (implying suicide as a solution).
    - No specific method, plan (tools, location, substance), or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""take myself away"" is vague and lacks concrete details.
    - No past suicidal actions or attempts are described. All references are to future intent (""one day"").
    - The desire to die is directly stated and not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. The author explicitly states ""I want to die"" and implies suicide (""take myself away from here"") to prevent harming others.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No**. While suicidal intent is clear, no method (e.g., pills, gun), plan specifics, or preparations are mentioned. ""Take myself away"" is nonspecific.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes a future intention (""one day i will"") with no indication of past/current concrete actions. No initiated suicidal act is reported.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and suicidal intent (""take myself away"") confirm **Ideation**. 
    - The absence of any method, plan, or preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
    - No past/current suicidal actions rule out **Attempt**. 
    - While distress is present, the explicit personal desire to die moves this beyond **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions feeling ""like trash,"" not wanting to exist, hopelessness (""no purpose,"" ""disappointment""), and distress from isolation during lockdown.  
   - Explicitly denies suicidality: ""I'm not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish.""  
   - No references to death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focuses on emotional distress and existential uncertainty without expressing a desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die.  
   - The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" is tempered by an immediate denial of suicidal intent (""I'm not suicidal or something"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **explicitly rejected** and labeled as ""selfish,"" indicating distress about *unwanted* feelings rather than a genuine wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No mention** of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggles but **no reference to past/current suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and passive thoughts of nonexistence but **actively negates suicidal desire**.  
   - Lacks explicit suicidal intent, plans, methods, or actions.  
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** due to the absence of personal suicidal desire and the explicit rejection of suicidality.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and actions: ""I want to take my life,"" ""The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating,"" and crucially, ""I attempted suicide last week.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""), worthlessness (""useless,"" ""no use to society""), and despair.  
   - Specific preparations are noted: drafting a suicide note (though not finalized/used).  
   - A **past suicide attempt** is explicitly described: ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed.""  
   - The author expresses a persistent desire to die but also references barriers (e.g., societal pressure, family intervention).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I want to take my life,"" ""taking my own life,"" and ""suicidal."" The desire to die is personal and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Preparations (drafting a note) are mentioned. However, the core focus is on the **past attempt**, not future plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key detail**: The author describes a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed."" This is a past act that was interrupted (by failure) but was initiated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes suicidal ideation (""I want to take my life"") and preparation (note drafting), but the **defining factor is the description of a past suicide attempt**.  
   - Per the rules: A past potentially lethal action takes precedence over current ideation/behavior. The attempt was recent (""last week"") and concrete.  
   - Thus, this meets the **'Attempt'** definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... potentially lethal, even if interrupted or failed.""

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post asks about a lethal dosage of Valium (""How much valium does it take to kill you?""), explicitly mentioning a method (overdosing on medication).
   - It expresses a desire for the ""nightmare to end"" (emotional despair/hopelessness).
   - The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates the author has *already taken Valium* with suicidal intent but fears the dose was insufficient for lethality. This describes a **concrete, self-initiated action** (ingesting pills).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. The question about lethal dosage and ""kill you"" (implied self-reference) shows explicit suicidal intent. ""I just want this nightmare to end"" confirms a desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. Valium is specified as the method. The phrase ""taken enough"" confirms **preparation/action was taken**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The phrase ""I haven't taken enough"" describes a **past/recent action** (ingesting pills) initiated by the author. This is a potentially lethal act that was carried out but may have failed (due to insufficient dosage).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes a **specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (taking Valium). This meets the definition of **Attempt** (a past/very recent initiated action, even if it failed or was interrupted). The presence of a method (Valium) and preparation (taking pills) further supports this. While there is current distress (""I just want this nightmare to end""), the concrete past action takes precedence for classification.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly references multiple past suicide attempts: swallowing bottles of sleeping pills at age 16 (with a suicide note), using a razor on their neck, and overdosing on prescriptions (both in November 2020).  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to live at all"") and distress over surviving near-death events.  
   - Specific methods are described (pills, razor, prescription overdose), and preparations are noted (suicide note).  
   - The motorcycle incident is framed as accidental, not suicidal.  
   - The temporal context is retrospective: all suicidal actions are clearly in the past.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the author states ""I don't want to live at all"" and explicitly labels past incidents as ""suicide attempts.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (pills, razor, overdose) and preparation (suicide note) are detailed for past attempts.  
   - **However, no current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - All described suicidal actions are **past events**:  
     - Pills/note at age 16 (initiated, required hospitalization).  
     - Razor cut in November 2020 (initiated, no lasting injury).  
     - Prescription overdose in November 2020 (initiated, survived).  
   - These are concrete, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post details **past suicidal actions** that were initiated and potentially lethal (e.g., swallowing pills, cutting neck, overdosing).  
   - While current distress (""I don't want to live"") suggests ongoing ideation, the **Attempt** category takes precedence because:  
     - The post centers on describing concrete past suicide attempts.  
     - The rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts [...] it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - No current plan/method/preparation is indicated, ruling out *Behavior*.  

**Conclusion**: The post meets the **Attempt** definition due to detailed descriptions of past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent: ""Tell me why I shouldn't kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" and ""I just need someone to push me one more inch.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""All failing,"" ""I'm fucking everything up now"") and despair.  
   - Specific method/preparation: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight.""  
   - Action taken: The author describes initiating a potentially lethal act (""Right before I passed out, I stopped, pulled it off"").  
   - Temporal context: The event occurred ""tonight"" (very recent), and the author states they are ""so close to just doing it"" (current intent).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and expressions of desire to die (e.g., ""I'm ready to be done"").  
   - The author does not negate or express unwanted thoughts; instead, they seek validation (""Tell me why I should"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Using a belt around the neck against a doorknob.  
   - Preparation/action: The author physically placed the belt and initiated the act.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **very recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (using the belt) that was interrupted by the author themselves (""I stopped"").  
   - This qualifies as an *initiated suicide attempt*, even though it was aborted.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent and a method aligns with 'Behavior,' **but** the description of a **concrete, initiated action** (""I put a belt..."") moves this to 'Attempt'.  
   - The act was potentially lethal (asphyxiation via ligature) and occurred very recently (""tonight"").  
   - Current distress/ideation (""so close to just doing it"") does not override the **past/recent initiated action**.  
   - Rules prioritize 'Attempt' when a potentially lethal action has been initiated, even if stopped.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" directly, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include ""scared,"" ""too tired of life"" (suggesting hopelessness and despair), and fear of legal consequences (""suicide is illegal here so if I fail I might get arrested or fined""). 
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no notes, means, or timing details). The focus is on the internal conflict between feeling tired of life and being too scared to act. The writer explicitly references barriers to action (fear and legal repercussions), implying no current intent to carry out suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - The desire to not be alive is implied (""too tired of life""), but it is coupled with a clear negation of intent (""too scared to kill myself"") and external deterrents (fear of arrest/fines). The writer emphasizes not wanting to act due to these fears, which aligns with unwanted thoughts rather than a genuine current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present. The discussion of failure (""if I fail"") is hypothetical and not tied to any concrete plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no initiated suicide attempts). The mention of ""if I fail"" is conditional and future-oriented, not describing any actual behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and distress (""too tired of life""), but the explicit statement of fear and barriers to action (""too scared,"" legal concerns) indicates these thoughts are unwanted and not accompanied by a current personal desire to die. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes mentions of suicidal thoughts when explicitly negated or presented as undesired. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior,' and no description of past actions, ruling out 'Attempt.' Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (due to the fear-based negation) also defaults to 'Indicator' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and existential despair (e.g., ""human life has no fucking purpose,"" ""rotting away"").  
   - Explicit future action: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good"" indicates a planned suicidal act.  
   - Specificity: Mentions a timeframe (""April"") and implies preparation (""taking a trip""), though no explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) is stated.  
   - Desire to die: ""end this bullshit for good"" conveys clear intent to terminate life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""End this bullshit for good"" is a direct expression of intent to die, framed as a solution to suffering.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Plan: ""Taking a trip in April"" implies purposeful preparation for suicide.  
   - Though no method is specified, the trip's stated purpose (""to end this..."") confirms it as part of a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future plan (April), not a past action. No initiated lethal act (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit desire to die and future plan move beyond general distress.  
   - **Ideation?** No. The trip signifies concrete planning/preparation.  
   - **Behavior?** Yes. Specific plan (trip in April) with intent to die.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No past/recent initiated lethal action described.

   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""no body cares,"" ""i have no one left to turn to""), anhedonia (""no motivation to even get up""), and feelings of worthlessness (""iv fucked myself over"").  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is stated: ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything.""  
   - Specific methods are mentioned (overdosing on meds, being hit by a car), but **no plan, preparation, or imminent timeline** is indicated (e.g., no reference to acquiring pills, going to a location, or setting a timeframe like ""tonight"").  
   - No past actions (e.g., prior attempts) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the author directly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds,"" indicating a personal wish for death. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (OD, car accident) are mentioned hypothetically (""wish""), but **no evidence of planning, preparation, or means acquisition** (e.g., no ""I have pills ready"" or ""going to the bridge"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **current feelings and wishes**, not past actions. There is **no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act** (e.g., ""I tried to OD last night"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a **clear desire to die** (""wish I could..."") with explicit suicidal methods, placing this beyond *Indicator* (which lacks personal suicidal desire).  
   - However, the methods are framed as passive wishes (""wish I could"") with **no plan, preparation, or imminent intent**, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - With **no past or recent initiated action**, *Attempt* does not apply.  
   - Thus, **Ideation** fits best: explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but no actionable plan or preparation.

101,"If your attractive and you complain about how depressed you are, go fuck yourself. Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning because at least I have that because appearance, which is totally determined by chance, is the thing that has by far the biggest difference in ones life. I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger, resentment, and hopelessness focused on the author's perceived physical unattractiveness and its lifelong negative impact. 
   - Key emotional indicators: despair (""daily torture""), hopelessness (""unwanted in literally all facets of life""), envy (""I would never stop smiling""), and worthlessness.
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). 
   - The phrase ""jump out of bed every morning"" is metaphorical (contrasted with current inability to do so) and not a reference to suicidal action. 
   - The author expresses a wish to have been born attractive (""I would give everything..."") but **no personal desire to die or end their life**. Distress stems from perceived injustice, not active suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No**. The post contains no direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent. The distress is centered on life circumstances, not a wish to cease existing.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No implied or explicit plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - **No past or recent actions** described. The post discusses ongoing emotional suffering and hypothetical scenarios (""if I were attractive""), but no concrete self-harm events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks explicit personal desire to die**, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. 
   - Metaphorical language (""jump out of bed"") does not indicate suicidal behavior. 
   - Falls under **'Indicator'**: Expresses profound despair and anguish about life circumstances without expressing current suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior.

102,'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""me being suicidal"" and explicitly states past actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" It also references emotional distress (e.g., feeling dismissed due to age, abuse, severe mental illness, and frustration with ignorance). However, the core focus is on the description of multiple past suicide attempts.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Direct phrases like ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself"" are used.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and frustration are present but secondary to the explicit suicide references.
   - Specific plans/methods: Not mentioned for current intentions; the post emphasizes past actions (""tried to kill myself"").
   - References to past actions: Clear description of initiated, potentially lethal actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" indicates concrete past attempts.
   - Imminence: No current or future time frame stated; the attempts are historical.
   - Desire: The author identifies as currently suicidal but does not express that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the primary evidence is the past behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die in the context of past actions. There is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or not acted upon currently.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is described. The post focuses on past attempts, which imply methods were used but are not specified here. For the current state, only suicidal thoughts are mentioned without a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past events: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" confirms specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions that were carried out (even if they failed or were interrupted). This is a historic account of attempts, not current ideation or planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal desire and references to past actions, not just thoughts. According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when past concrete, potentially lethal actions are described, even if current ideation is present. Here, the detailed account of multiple attempts (""tried to kill myself 8 times"") clearly fits the 'Attempt' definition. It does not meet 'Behavior' because no current plan or preparation is indicated, and 'Ideation' is overruled by the past actions. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the explicit suicidal intent and actions.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""i'm better off dead,"" which is a direct reference to death and implies a personal preference for not being alive.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration or irony (e.g., contrasting advice about removing sources of sadness with others' reactions to the author's statement), but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden is described.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The desire for death is stated (""i'm better off dead""), but the context includes others' negative reactions (""no don't do that"") and a "":D"" emoticon, which could suggest sarcasm or distress. However, the author does not explicitly state that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to die (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""better off dead"" is a clear expression of a personal desire to not be alive, framed in a context of despair (comparing life situations).
   - There is no explicit negation of the desire (e.g., the author does not say they do not want these thoughts). The focus is on others' reactions, not on the author rejecting the idea.
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' because the author personally expresses a wish to be dead.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied.
   - This absence means the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a general, ongoing feeling or statement (""when i say""), not a past event or recent action.
   - There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to trying something and failing or being stopped), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key phrase ""i'm better off dead"" is an explicit personal expression of a desire to die, placing this above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire). The sarcastic tone (:D) and others' reactions do not negate the expressed desire, as the author does not disavow it.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits 'Ideation' best: it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive, without specifics on how or when it might happen.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific method: ""took 44 paracetamol"" (acetaminophen overdose).  
   - Describes physical symptoms indicating active harm: ""stomach hurting badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking,"" occurring ""almost an hour ago.""  
   - Expresses ambivalence: ""i dont think i want to die,"" but also ""something is stopping me cllng 999"" (barrier to help-seeking).  
   - References self-blame: ""i feel like a burden,"" ""i did this to myself.""  
   - No explicit suicide terminology (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""), but overdose implies intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Ambiguous desire: ""i dont think i want to die"" suggests conflict, but the act (overdose) indicates lethal intent. **Leaning away from 'Indicator'.**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Specific method and quantity**: ""44 paracetamol"" (preparation/action taken).  
   - **Initiated action**: Overdose occurred ""almost an hour ago,"" with active physical symptoms.  
   - **Barriers to help**: ""something stopping me cllng 999"" reinforces the action was intentional.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: Took pills an hour ago, symptoms ongoing.  
   - Action was concrete and life-threatening (paracetamol overdose can cause fatal liver damage).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** criteria met: Concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (overdose) with physical consequences.  
   - Ambivalence (""i dont think i want to die"") doesn’t negate the initiated act.  
   - Past action takes precedence over current uncertainty.  
   - Rules: Focus on the author’s action (overdose), not just thoughts.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to end it,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide, indicating a personal desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include despair, as seen in the repetition of the phrase, but no specific emotions like hopelessness or anhedonia are detailed.
   - There is no mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations; in fact, the author states ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" explicitly denying any plan or means.
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or preparations are present.
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - The desire to ""end it"" is expressed, but the lack of a plan or method suggests uncertainty, not an explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted. The primary sentiment is the desire itself, not distress about having unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, ""I want to end it"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent, equivalent to phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself"" in common usage.
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to end it"") without negation of the desire; the uncertainty is about execution, not the wish itself.
   - There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not want to act on them (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to""). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The author explicitly states they have ""no idea how, when or anything else,"" ruling out any plan.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is a desire to die but no indication of a plan or method, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""I want to end it"") but no specific timeframe.
   - No description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interruptions, or failures). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""I want to end it""), which qualifies it for 'Ideation' or higher.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - The author does not express that the thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that would make it 'Indicator'; instead, the focus is on the desire itself.
   - Rules clarification: If desire is present but no plan/method, choose 'Ideation'. Since the author states no knowledge of ""how, when or anything else,"" this confirms the absence of a plan.
   - Final category is 'Ideation' based on explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan.

I'm really trying but it feels completely hopeless bc I know I should be fine. but I'm just not.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - **Key Elements:** The post describes emotional distress (exhaustion, hopelessness, feeling like a ""robot""), frustration with cyclical mental health struggles (""vicious cycle of highs and lows""), perceived lack of support (""I just want someone to care""), and self-criticism (""I know I should be fine. but I'm just not"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide/Death Mentions:** None. No references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods.  
   - **Emotional Indicators:** Strong hopelessness (""feels completely hopeless""), anhedonia (""can't just enjoy my life""), and feelings of isolation/burden (""relying on me for stability"").  
   - **Plans/Methods/Preparations:** None mentioned.  
   - **Past Actions:** No references to past suicidal actions, attempts, or preparations.  
   - **Temporal Context:** Focuses on current emotional state and ongoing struggles; no imminent threats or time-specific plans.  
   - **Stated Desire:** Expresses distress and emotional pain but **no desire to die**. The closest reference (""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"") frames the struggle as involuntary, not a wish for death.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Explicit Phrases?** No mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.  
   - **Desire to Die?** No statements expressing a wish to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - **Unwanted Thoughts?** While distress is evident, there are no explicit suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted) to evaluate.  
   - **Conclusion:** Lacks explicit suicidal intent. Leans toward **Indicator**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **Method/Plan Mentioned?** No references to tools, locations, substances, or plans.  
   - **Preparations?** None described.  
   - **Conclusion:** No evidence of planning. Rules out **Behavior** or **Attempt**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - **Past/Future Actions?** No description of past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) or imminent future actions.  
   - **Conclusion:** Rules out **Attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses **severe distress, hopelessness, and emotional overload** but lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past actions.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I should be fine. but I'm just not"" and ""feels completely hopeless"" highlight despair but not ideation.  
   - **Why not Ideation?** No expressions of wanting to die or suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I wish I wasn’t here"").  
   - **Ambiguity Resolution:** Where hopelessness exists without explicit suicidal desire, **Indicator** is the default.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past struggles: severe depression, bipolar breakdowns, feeling ""almost abusive,"" and physical symptoms like daily vomiting for 2 years.  
   - References ""rock bottom"" metaphorically (""there's nothing lower but death"") but frames it as a past experience they’ve moved beyond.  
   - Expresses current improvement (""last 2 years since I've been way better""), self-acceptance, and hope (""stay positive and stay safe"").  
   - No explicit desire to die, suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or personal desire to die.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past hardships** (depression, breakdowns) but **no concrete suicidal actions** (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  
   - ""Almost being abusive"" refers to behavioral tendencies, not self-harm or suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Distress and hopelessness are present but **lack personal suicidal desire**, plans, or actions.  
   - ""Rock bottom"" analogy is abstract; post emphasizes recovery and hope.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses distress and past struggles but no current/active suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""ending it soon"" and ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" (likely a typo for ""overdosing""), indicating a specific method.  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt, overwhelm, fear of pain, and hopelessness (""i dont know what else to do"").  
   - A plan is mentioned: ""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" as the ""go-to plan,"" with timing uncertainty (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").  
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on future intent.  
   - The desire to die is explicit (""plan on ending it soon""), though fear of pain is noted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""ending it"" implies suicide, and the method (overdosing) confirms suicidal intent.  
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die, despite fear of pain.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") and plan (""go-to plan"") are explicitly stated.  
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring pills) are mentioned, but the method is concrete.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""soon,"" ""tonight or this week"") but **no past or recent initiated action** (e.g., no attempt described).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No—explicit desire to die and a plan are present.  
   - **Ideation?** No—while desire is clear, the specific method/plan elevates it beyond ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions explicit suicidal intent: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness/despair: ""I feel like shit,"" ""some people are born/meant to be fucked up.""  
   - Specifies a method (gun) but **explicitly states lack of access** (""If I had a gun"").  
   - No preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) or imminent timeline.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (relapse refers to pornography, not self-harm).

   - Yes: Directly states ""I'd kill myself"" with a clear desire to die to avoid future suffering.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past relapse (pornography) but **no past or recent suicidal actions**. Suicidal thought is current but not acted upon.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"") → rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Method (gun) is specified but hypothetical/conditional, with **no plan/preparation** → *Behavior* requires explicit planning elements, which are absent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and explicitly states ""i just wanna kill myself,"" indicating a personal desire related to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""impossible to avoid,"" ""my lungs are destroyed,"" ""im gonna get lung cancer""), despair about the situation, and concern for others (""my poor baby brother is gonna get it too"").
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past suicide actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors are present.
   - The expression ""i just wanna kill myself"" conveys a current desire but lacks temporal imminence (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the phrase ""kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""i just wanna kill myself before i have to see him or myself get it"") in the context of avoiding future suffering.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied for carrying out suicide.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described.
   - Since there is desire but no plan/method, this aligns with 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a desire to die but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or failures).
   - The focus is on the present emotional state and future fears, not on any initiated lethal behavior.

   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

111,My last time posting on this account. I've got a suicide plan. Hello. I've finally got a plan on how i can kill myself and after thinking it over i'm pretty sure this will work. I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" ""plan on how I can kill myself,"" ""this will work,"" ""doing it next week.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""worthless existence,"" ""past years have been shit,"" excitement about ""finally moving on.""  
   - Plan/preparation: Clear statement of having a plan, confidence it will work, and a timeline (""next week"").  
   - Imminence: Action planned for ""next week,"" not immediate but specified.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""excited to finally move on""), with no indication thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" ""I plan on doing it."" Genuine desire to die is evident (""excited to move on"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A specific plan is confirmed (""I've finally got a plan""), and preparations are implied (e.g., evaluating its effectiveness, setting a timeline). Though no method is detailed, the explicit mention of a plan qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""next week""). No past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of trying/stopping a method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + confirmed plan/preparation → 'Behavior' (per rules: ""mentions a plan to commit suicide"" even briefly).  
   - No initiated action → not 'Attempt'.  
   - Plan specificity overrides ambiguity about method → 'Behavior' (not 'Ideation').

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide attempt (""attempted suicide in the past many years ago"").  
   - Expresses recurrence of suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again"").  
   - Describes severe distress (hopelessness due to chronic pain, guilt about seeking help).  
   - **No explicit current desire to die**; instead, focuses on seeking support (wife, appointments, friend).  
   - **No mention of a current plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline** for suicide.  
   - Past attempt is explicitly historical (""many years ago""), not recent or ongoing.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No *current* explicit statement of desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die now"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but framed as recurrent struggles, not active intent.  
   - **No** genuine wish to die expressed in the present context; instead, emphasis is on guilt and seeking help.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned.  
   - Past attempt is referenced but not indicative of current behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past attempt described (""many years ago"") – **not recent or initiated now**.  
   - **No current or recent concrete action** (e.g., overdose, self-harm) described.  
   - Focus is on emotional distress and help-seeking, not imminent risk.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Recurrent suicidal thoughts + past attempt indicate severe distress but **no current plan/method** → Not 'Behavior'.  
   - Past attempt is historical → Not 'Attempt' (requires recent/concrete action).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but **unaccompanied by current desire, plan, or preparation** → 'Ideation' (explicit personal thoughts of suicide without plan).  
   - Distress and guilt are prominent, but suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated → Not 'Indicator' (which requires absence of personal desire/thoughts).

113,"Dont even feel like a person anymore. I can't socialize well and that's the main fucking part of being in a society. It's pushing away the most important people in my life like my bf and I can't even bring myself to tell him that I'm suffering. I'm afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave. In which case I think I would go insane. I have so many issues that I don't tell anyone and I've never felt like that's been an option for me. I don't even open up to my best friends about my depression and thoughts of sh. I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best. It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feelings of inadequacy (""dont even feel like a person""), isolation (""can't socialize well""), fear of abandonment (""afraid he won't want baggage like me""), and hopelessness (""It's getting to be too much"").  
   - Mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) as a coping mechanism but explicitly states she avoids cutting to hide it from her boyfriend.  
   - **No explicit mention of suicide, death, dying, or desire to die**. Self-harm (sh) is referenced as a coping strategy, not a suicidal act.  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or timeline for suicide**. The focus is on internal suffering and inability to cope/open up.  
   - **No description of past/current suicidal actions or attempts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Self-harm (""sh"") is mentioned but framed as a withheld coping mechanism, not a desire to die. The phrase ""I can't even cope in the way that works best"" suggests distress about *losing* a coping outlet, not suicidal intent.  
   - **Leans toward 'Indicator'**: Distress is central; suicidal desire is absent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None present**. References to self-harm (cutting) are past-tense coping strategies she feels unable to use now. No tools, locations, or suicide plans are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **ongoing emotional struggles**, not past/current suicidal actions. Avoidance of self-harm is noted, but no initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of a prior suicide attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post reveals severe distress, depression, and self-harm ideation as coping—but **no expressed desire to die, no suicide plan, and no suicidal behavior/attempt**.  
   - Self-harm (sh) is distinct from suicide; here, it’s presented as a maladaptive coping mechanism, not a pathway to death.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: The author expresses anguish and unwanted thoughts (of self-harm) but lacks explicit suicidal desire, plan, or action.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions death and dying (""when I die"", ""if I'm dead"") and expresses a desire for death as a means to end pain (""my pain is finally over"", ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). It conveys hopelessness and a belief that death is the only solution to suffering. There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), or past actions. No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The writer expresses a personal desire to die for relief, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a personal desire to die through phrases like ""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This indicates a genuine wish to not be alive to end pain, with no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Therefore, explicit suicidal intent is present, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied. The post focuses on the rationale for death (ending pain) but lacks concrete planning elements. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses death in a future context (""when I die"") but does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions). It is entirely prospective, with no indication of initiated behavior. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows a clear personal desire to die, which aligns with 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method). It does not fit 'Indicator' because the distress includes a direct expression of wanting death, not just general unhappiness or abstract discussion. 'Behavior' is ruled out due to the absence of any plan or preparation details. 'Attempt' is not relevant as no past actions are described. The post expresses suicidal ideation through the author's stated need for death to achieve happiness.

115,I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't care about anything anymore,"" ""my life is all downhill,"" ""I have nothing in my life""), despair, and a stated lack of desire to live (""I don't want to live"").
   - There is no specific mention of a method, tool, location, or substance for suicide (e.g., ""take the leap"" is metaphorical and not a clear reference to a method like jumping; it emphasizes the decision rather than a plan).
   - No preparations are described (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - The post references a past delay (""you guys helped me stay here about a month longer"") but no past or recent suicidal actions.
   - The desire to die is clear and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.
   - Imminence is implied by ""finally decided"" and ""goodbye,"" but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I don't want to live"").
   - There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""), so this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or strongly implied. ""Take the leap"" is an idiom for committing to a decision and is not a clear reference to a suicide method like jumping.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means, or farewell actions beyond the general ""goodbye"" in the post).
   - Without an explicit plan or preparation, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current intention or decision (""finally decided"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, even if interrupted or failed).
   - The focus is on future intent, not concrete past behavior, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""I don't want to live""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the content fits 'Ideation', which involves explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die without specific plans or preparations.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""goodbye,"" which imply suicidal intent. The author expresses a desire for death (""i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"") and reflects on life, indicating hopelessness about the past year. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations like writing a note. The temporal context is future-oriented (""before i end it all""), with no description of past or recent suicidal actions. The emotional tone suggests acceptance and resolve, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits,"" which are direct euphemisms for suicide. The author expresses a clear desire to die (""i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"") with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" could be interpreted as a preparatory act, but it is not an explicit suicide preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). Without a clear plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""before i end it all"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. The author has not taken any concrete steps yet; they are only planning to act after playing the game.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire and intent, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts). The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. With no description of past or recent initiated actions, it is not an 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation'—expressing a desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no concrete plan.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post is written by someone expressing concern about a friend they met online.  
   - The friend reportedly attempted suicide (""tried to kill herself"") and is now under restrictions.  
   - The author states they are scared and asks how to check if the friend is okay.  
   - **Key elements**: No mention of the author's own suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, methods, preparations, or actions. Focus is entirely on the friend's situation and the author's worry/helplessness. Emotional indicators (fear, concern) relate to another person, not the author themselves.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author does **not** express any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or intent. Phrases like ""I need help"" and ""I'm scared"" reflect distress about another person.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the author. The only references are to the friend's past attempt.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The author describes no personal past or recent suicidal actions. The only action referenced is the friend's past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses **general distress** (fear for a friend's safety) but **no personal suicidal desire, plan, or action**.  
   - Mentions of suicide are about a third party, not the author.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress without personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I will hang myself now"" and ""kill me,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide by hanging.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to be alone anymore""), despair about lifelong isolation and bullying, and anhedonia (e.g., sitting alone daily). Self-harm is mentioned as no longer effective, adding to distress.
   - Specific method and preparation are present: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"" shows active seeking of means for hanging, and weight (44kg) is noted to assess lethality.
   - Imminence is high with ""now"" and the immediate search for tools.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, action is being taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""hang myself"" and ""kill me.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I will hang myself now"").
   - No, suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; the writer is actively pursuing the act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (hanging) is mentioned, and preparation (""looking for something that I can tie"") is described.
   - This indicates concrete steps toward carrying out suicide, moving beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intention (""I will hang myself now"") and real-time preparation.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal action is described; self-harm is mentioned but framed as ineffective history, not a concrete suicide attempt. The current behavior is preparatory, not yet acted upon.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit suicidal intent and desire to die rule out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a specific method (hanging) and active preparation (searching for tools) elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - No initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., a described attempt) is present, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post shows suicidal thoughts with a plan and ongoing preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""shattered,"" ""miserable,"" ""can barely function,"" ""ripped apart,"" and ""can't stop shaking.""
   - Mentions not knowing ""how to live anymore"" and hopelessness about functioning.
   - **Explicitly states**: ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" directly negating a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, dying, or killing oneself.

   - Absence of suicidal thoughts/ideation, plans, or behaviors.  
   - Fits 'Indicator' definition: expressions of distress without personal desire to die or suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense frustration and despair about a stressful work situation. Key elements include:
   - Explicit mention: ""I just want to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?""), feeling trapped (""I want out now""), and perceived lack of control.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Temporal context: Desires are expressed as current (""I want out now"") but lack immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The writer’s desire is explicitly stated (""I want to kill myself,"" ""I want out"") without negation or indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post opens with a personal expression: ""AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""DIE"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""you have no skills valuable to other people""), despair (""everyone hates themselves""), and references to suicidal thoughts as a ""cope"" or ""distraction.""  
   - Methods are described in detail (e.g., ""nitroglycerin,"" ""power plants,"" ""extension ladders,"" ""wire cutters""), but these are framed as hypothetical advice to the reader (""you""), not the author.  
   - The author explicitly states the reader ""will never do it"" and labels suicidal thoughts as a fantasy, distancing themselves from acting.  
   - No personal past actions, preparations, or imminent plans by the author are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the author personally states, ""I WANT TO DOIE [DIE].""  
   - However, the post immediately shifts to addressing ""you"" (the reader) and frames suicidal thoughts as unwanted (""suicidal thoughts are a cope... you will never do it""). The author’s personal expression of desire is not reinforced; instead, it is contrasted with assertions of inaction.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are discussed (nitroglycerin, power plants), but **only in the context of advising the reader**, not as the author’s personal plan. The author states ""you will never do it,"" undermining intent.  
   - **No evidence** the author has a plan, method, or preparation for themselves.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions by the author are described.  
   - Violent suggestions are future-oriented but directed at the reader, not the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a fleeting personal desire to die (""I WANT TO DOIE"") but immediately invalidates it as a ""cope"" and emphasizes inaction (""you will never do it"").  
   - The detailed methods are hypothetical and generalized (addressing ""you""), not tied to the author’s intent.  
   - Since the suicidal thought is framed as unwanted and unactionable by the author, and no personal plan/action exists, this aligns with **Indicator** (distress about suicidal ideation without genuine personal desire/plan to act).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe bullying directed at the author's friend, including threats (""go kill yourself,"" ""it's gonna be the fucking end of you"") and harassment.  
   - The **friend's reactions** include being ""mentally disturbed,"" constantly tired, refusing to eat/go out, and feeling overwhelmed.  
   - **No explicit mentions** from the friend of personal suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. The only suicide-related content is the bully's words (""go kill yourself""), not the friend's own expression.  
   - Emotional indicators (distress, overwhelm) are present but lack personal suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**: The friend does not express any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or intent. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is attributed to the bully, not the friend.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: There is no mention of the friend having a suicide plan, method, or engaging in preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No**: The post describes the friend's emotional state and behavioral changes (e.g., withdrawal) but **no initiated suicidal actions**, past or present.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The friend exhibits distress (tiredness, overwhelm, social withdrawal) and is impacted by bullying, but **there is no personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from her**. The suicide-related phrase (""go kill yourself"") is solely the bully's words, not the friend's sentiment.  
   - This aligns with **Indicator**: General distress without explicit personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), isolation (""people don’t get my pain""), self-loathing (""loser, ugly""), burden (""alone"").  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself"" explicitly stated.  
   - Preparation/plan: None mentioned (e.g., no notes, tools, or imminent timing).  
   - Desire to die: Explicit (""I want to hang myself so bad"") but conflicted (""holding on a bit because I have a small piece of hope"").  
   - Past actions: None described (e.g., no initiated attempts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I want to hang myself.""  
   - Desire is clear despite conflicted hope; not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned: ""hang myself.""  
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, setting a time) described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future intentions (""I want to hang myself"").  
   - No past/initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (""hang myself"") = **Behavior**.  
   - No preparations or imminent timeline, but method specificity overrides Ideation.  
   - No past actions, so Attempt is ruled out.  
   - Hope mentioned doesn’t negate the explicit suicidal intent with method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions multiple past suicide attempts (""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?""). 
   - It also expresses a current desire to attempt suicide (""still want to attempt again""), countered by a stated reason to stay alive. 
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation for future suicide is described (e.g., tools, location, timing). 
   - The writer references barriers to seeking help (financial/health concerns) but no imminent suicidal action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""Attempted"" directly references suicidal actions, and ""still want to attempt again"" confirms current suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific plan/method for future actions**: While past attempts are acknowledged, no details about methods for those attempts or new plans are provided. The current desire (""still want to attempt"") lacks any described plan or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **concrete past actions** (""attempted last night,"" ""15th time"") that were initiated and potentially lethal. The reference to a recent attempt (""last night"") is unambiguous. Current suicidal desire exists but lacks initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past potentially lethal actions (attempts) dominate the post, satisfying the 'Attempt' definition. Current ideation (""still want to attempt"") is present but does not override the focus on **concrete past actions**. No plan/preparation for future suicide elevates it to 'Behavior,' so 'Attempt' takes precedence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""at the end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling,"" ""sad,"" ""scared,"" and hopelessness (""I don’t see a reason"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to not wake up (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don’t wake up"").  
   - References past experiences (""as I’ve done this before, I know I’ll wake up"") but **no specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, or notes).  
   - Describes fear of acting (""too scared to go all the way through"") and not wanting to burden friends.  
   - No description of a concrete, initiated suicidal action (e.g., taking pills, cutting).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**, the desire to die is explicit: ""I hope I don’t wake up"" indicates a wish to not be alive.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method** (e.g., pills, hanging) or **preparation** (e.g., note, acquiring tools) is mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""go all the way through"" vaguely references action but lacks specificity about means or plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past experiences (""done this before"") imply prior distress or ideation but **no description of a concrete past suicidal action** (e.g., ""I took pills"").  
   - Current feelings of fear and hopelessness are emphasized, but no imminent plan or initiated behavior is stated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""I hope I don’t wake up"") → Rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** mentioned → Rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No description of a past/current initiated lethal action** (e.g., overdosing) → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits **'Ideation'**: Expresses personal suicidal desire (""hope I don’t wake up"") without specifics on method or plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have ran out of chances""), despair (""everything is gone""), and burden (""you should've never given me your time"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past action: ""tried to pass a week ago,"" ""swallowed [bleach],"" ""vomited,"" ""heartburn.""  
   - Explicit method: ""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it.""  
   - Preparation: ""leave a note for my parents.""  
   - Emotional context: Depression, suicidal episodes, but current state is ""a little okay now.""  
   - Imminence: Past event (""a week ago"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""tried to pass,"" ""suicide episode,"" ""last breath.""  
   - Clear desire to die at the time: ""thought that was the last breath.""  
   - No negation of intent during the event.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""swallowed [bleach].""  
   - Preparation: ""leave a note.""  
   - Tools: ""bleach.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past, concrete, self-initiated action**: Swallowing bleach, resulting in vomiting and heartburn.  
   - Action was potentially lethal (bleach ingestion).  
   - Outcome: Interrupted by vomiting (survived).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post describes a **past, potentially lethal suicidal action** (ingesting bleach).  
   - Despite current improvement (""a little okay now""), the detailed account of the initiated action meets the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - Rules: Past attempts take precedence over current ideation/behavior.  
   - Not 'Behavior' (current/future plan) or 'Ideation' (desire without action).

I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I still want to die"" and ""the only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents,"" indicating a personal desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""lost all will to live""), despair after a sibling's death, and worsened anxiety/depression. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). No past suicidal actions are described—only coping efforts like ""tried to pull through."" Imminence is not specified (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire to die is genuine but restrained by concern for parents; it is not framed as unwanted thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want these thoughts"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""want to die"" directly expresses a personal desire to not be alive in a context of despair. The writer does not negate or express distress about the thoughts being unwanted; instead, they acknowledge the desire but cite an external barrier (parents). Thus, explicit intent is present, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, substances, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is on the internal desire and emotional state, with no indication of planning or steps taken. This absence rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event (sibling's death and emotional aftermath) and current feelings (""I still want to die""), but no concrete, initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no reference to an overdose or self-harm attempt). The phrase ""tried to pull through"" refers to coping, not a suicide attempt. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""want to die"") places this in 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' (which would require ambiguous or unwanted thoughts without genuine desire). The lack of any plan, method, or preparation distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. No past or recent suicidal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" – explicit reference to suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths,"" ""darkest corners,"" and feeling ""worse off than before"" imply hopelessness.
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring tools) is mentioned. The reference to taking ""a few tabs of acid"" is framed as a coping attempt, not a suicide method.
   - The outcome contingency (""if it helps... if it doesn't"") suggests passive acceptance of potential worsening, but no active plan or imminent action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Stated desire: The writer expresses enduring suicidal ideation but frames LSD as an alternative intervention. The phrase ""my end will only get nearer"" implies resignation rather than active intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" and ""my end will only get nearer,"" confirming personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No specific plan/method**: Acid (LSD) is mentioned as a potential coping tool, not a suicide method. No details about how suicide would be carried out (e.g., ""overdose on acid"").  
   - **No preparation**: No references to acquiring means, writing notes, or final acts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes ongoing suicidal thoughts (""months on end"") and a future experiment with LSD.  
   - **No past/recent action**: No description of an initiated suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (suicidal thoughts) places this above *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of a specific plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a concrete past/recent action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is persistent suicidal ideation without actionable steps, fitting *Ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions stealing and consuming the dog's prescription hydrocodone mixed with alcohol to ""feel ok for one night,"" indicating substance misuse as a coping mechanism for distress. Emotional indicators include ""hit a new low,"" ""haven't felt ok in a while,"" and ""not sure what to do,"" showing hopelessness and despair. There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific suicidal methods. The actions (stealing hydrocodone and drinking) are described as recent (""tonight"") and focused on alleviating distress, not ending life. The writer's stated desire is to feel better temporarily, with no expression of a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die or not be alive is expressed; the focus is on seeking temporary relief from distress.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication of them being unwanted or negated.
   - Conclusion: Lacks explicit suicidal intent, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Substances (hydrocodone and alcohol) are mentioned, but they are used for coping (""to feel ok""), not as part of a suicidal plan, method, or preparation.
   - No signs of suicidal planning (e.g., acquiring means for suicide, writing a note, or selecting a method/location).
   - Conclusion: No suicidal plan or preparation evident, supporting 'Indicator' or 'Ideation' but not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes past/recent actions (stealing hydrocodone and drinking tonight), but these are framed as coping mechanisms, not suicidal acts.
   - No description of a specific, potentially lethal suicidal action that was initiated (e.g., no mention of taking substances to die). The behavior is risky but not suicidal in intent.
   - Conclusion: Actions do not constitute a suicide attempt; they are substance misuse for distress relief.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal desire to die or explicit suicidal thoughts, fitting 'Indicator'.
   - No suicidal ideation (desire to die) is present, so not 'Ideation'.
   - No plan, method, or preparation for suicide, so not 'Behavior'.
   - No initiated suicidal action, so not 'Attempt'.
   - Ambiguity: While substance misuse is dangerous, it is not presented as suicidal, and the writer's intent is to ""feel ok,"" not to end life. Rule: If in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore"") and despair (""Nothing in my life is working out""). It mentions social isolation (""I don't have any friends"").  
   - No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - No mention of past actions, temporal urgency, or unwanted suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""no point in living"" implies a lack of purpose but **does not explicitly state a desire to die, commit suicide, or end life**. It reflects hopelessness, not active suicidal intent.  
   - **Answer**: No explicit desire to die. Leans toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned.  
   - **Answer**: Absent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a current state of distress, not a past or imminent action. No initiated behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is hopelessness and distress without explicit suicidal desire, plan, or action.  
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** because:  
     - It lacks a *personal, current desire to die* (e.g., ""I want to die"" is not stated).  
     - Vague expressions like ""no point in living"" signal despair but not suicidal intent.  
     - No plan/method/preparation exists to elevate to 'Behavior'.  
   - *Ambiguity note*: The phrasing borders on passive suicidal ideation but lacks explicit desire for death. Per rules, when unsure between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions taking ""a fuck load of pills"" and states ""might not wake up tomorrow,"" indicating a specific method (overdose) and an expectation of death.  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel so guilty""), self-blame (""my problems are my own""), and feelings of being a burden (""They deserve so much more than me"").  
   - The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" uses past tense, describing a concrete action already initiated by the author.  
   - The temporal context is immediate (""might not wake up tomorrow""), suggesting the action occurred very recently.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - While the words ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, the statement ""might not wake up tomorrow"" explicitly anticipates death from the pills taken. The author’s desire to die is strongly implied by the irreversible action described.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific method is mentioned (""taken a fuck load of pills""). The phrasing confirms the action was executed, not just planned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a past/recent self-initiated action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that is potentially lethal. The outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow"") hinges on this completed act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author describes a potentially lethal self-initiated action (overdose) that has already occurred. This fits the 'Attempt' definition (past/very recent initiated action with potential lethality).  
   - Despite expressing guilt and distress, the core of the post is the concrete action taken. 'Attempt' takes precedence over 'Behavior' (plan/preparation) or 'Ideation' (desire without action) because a lethal act was initiated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning out my suicide"" and states a clear desire to die (""I will go through with this"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""can't find a reason to continue living""), fear of past failure, and self-perception as a burden.  
   - Specific plans are indicated: timing (""January 1st""), secrecy (""not tell anyone""), and intent to avoid intervention (""no intention of being saved"").  
   - References a past attempt (""fear of failing an attempt once again"") but focuses on future intent.  
   - Desire to die is explicit and affirmed (""I will go through with this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""planning out my suicide,"" ""I will go through with this,"" and ""can't find a reason to continue living"" show a clear, current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A specific timeline (""January 1st"") and preparations for secrecy (avoiding disclosure, maintaining a ""normal"" facade) are mentioned. Though no method is specified, the structured plan (timing + secrecy) qualifies as preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""I intend to do it right this time""). The past attempt is referenced but not described as a recent/concrete action. No initiated lethal action is occurring or just occurred.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Desire is present, but a plan (timeline + secrecy) elevates it beyond thoughts alone.

I actually hate being alive but i dont want to weigh down my family and friends. sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now because if i wait for later it will just hurt them more. For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a strong desire not to live (""100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive"") and directly references suicide (""kill myself"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""wish I was never born""), feeling like a burden (""don't want to weigh down my family and friends""), and ambivalence about acting (""too scared to kill myself"").  
   - There is contemplation of timing (""wonder if I should just do it now""), but **no specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned.  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive"").  
   - While fear is cited as a barrier to action, the author **does not negate the desire to die** (e.g., no statement like ""I don’t actually want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, locations, or notes). General urgency (""do it now"") is present but lacks concrete details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **current/future intentions** with no mention of past actions. Phrases like ""should just do it now"" are speculative, not descriptive of an initiated act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits because:  
     - There is an **explicit, personal desire to die** (""do not want to live,"" ""kill myself"").  
     - **No plan, method, or preparation** is indicated (ruling out *Behavior*).  
     - **No past or recent suicidal action** is described (ruling out *Attempt*).  
     - The presence of fear or ambivalence **does not negate the expressed desire to die**, distinguishing it from *Indicator* (which requires absence of genuine suicidal desire).

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes a specific method: hanging. It details actions taken: ""i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die."" 
   - Emotional indicators include distress implied by ""half heartedly"" and the repetitive nature (""frequently""), but no explicit hopelessness or burden statements. 
   - There is a specific method (hanging) and preparation (leaving a chair/object to prevent death), but the intent is explicitly non-lethal (""so i don't die""). 
   - The post references past actions (""frequently"") initiated by the author, but these actions are controlled to avoid death. 
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated; it's described as a recurring behavior. 
   - The writer's stated desire is clear: they do not want to die, as evidenced by the safety measure and the phrase ""so i don't die.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and ""hang myself,"" which are direct phrases related to suicide. 
   - However, the writer negates a genuine desire to die by ensuring the actions are not lethal (""so i don't die""). The ""half heartedly"" qualifier further indicates a lack of full intent. 
   - The suicidal thoughts/actions are presented as unwanted in outcome, as the author takes steps to prevent death, leaning this toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (hanging) and preparation (setting up with a chair/object) are mentioned. 
   - But this is coupled with an explicit lack of lethal intent, as the preparation includes a safety feature to avoid death. Therefore, it does not clearly indicate a plan for a genuine suicide attempt.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions (""frequently"") that are self-initiated but not potentially lethal due to the safety measure. 
   - The actions are concrete (hanging) but designed to be non-lethal, so they do not qualify as a suicide attempt. No recent or imminent lethal action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses distress and describes suicidal behavior, but the author explicitly states no desire to die (""so i don't die""), fitting 'Indicator' (mentions of suicidal actions with unwanted outcomes). 
   - It lacks a clear, current desire to die for it to be 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. The method/preparation is present but negated by intent, so it doesn't meet 'Behavior' fully. 
   - No potentially lethal action occurred, ruling out 'Attempt'. 
   - Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire exists (due to ""attempt"" language vs. safety measures), so per rules, lean toward 'Indicator'.

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions past suicide attempt (""had an attempt when I was 14""), ""close calls,"" and current despair (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I see no point anymore""), isolation (""I'm alone""), and feeling trapped (""I'm stuck""). 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent timelines for future suicide. References to past attempts are historical. 
   - The desire to die is expressed passively (""not meant for me"") rather than as an immediate intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, phrases like ""I've been suicidal,"" ""don't want to go on,"" and ""world not meant for me"" convey a personal desire to die. No negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No mention of current methods, tools, locations, or preparations. Past attempts are noted but not current plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Past actions: Describes a historical attempt (""at 14"") and vague ""close calls."" No recent/ongoing concrete actions (e.g., no ""I took pills yesterday""). 
   - Current expressions focus on ideation without initiation of new behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Clear desire to die and explicit suicidal history place this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no genuine desire). 
   - Absence of current plans/methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*. 
   - Past *Attempt* is acknowledged but is not recent/active; the primary focus is current hopelessness and passive suicidal thoughts without actionable steps. 
   - Fits *Ideation*: Explicit personal desire to die (""don't want to go on"") without plans or imminent actions.

137,I am 29 still live with my parents. 4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post begins with a statement about the author's life situation (""I am 29 still live with my parents""), which may imply distress, frustration, or feelings of failure. The second part consists of incoherent text (""4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo""), including the word ""fuck"" repeated, suggesting emotional outburst, anger, or distress. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, or being a burden are explicitly stated. No plans, preparations, past actions, or temporal context related to suicide are present. The overall tone is one of frustration but lacks any suicidal content.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. No expression of a desire to die or not be alive. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no discussion of them being unwanted. The content does not indicate any personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide is mentioned or implied. The incoherent text does not convey any actionable plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current life situation and emotional state but no past, current, or future suicidal actions. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and frustration (e.g., about living with parents and the emotional outburst in the gibberish), but it lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or preparation. Therefore, it fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes expressions of distress without suicidal intent. There is no evidence to support 'Ideation' (no desire to die expressed), 'Behavior' (no plan or method), or 'Attempt' (no described actions).

138,One of these days I'll finally do it. I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore I've done it many times and I figured out how to properly hang myself but at the moment there is too much potential interference. I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself"" is stated multiple times, along with specific methods (""hang myself,"" ""cutting again"" to increase COVID risk). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'll finally do it,"" ""I just wish I could die in my sleep"") and a lack of fear regarding suicide. Preparations are implied through ""figured out how to properly hang myself,"" indicating planning. References to past actions include ""I've done it many times,"" which likely refers to previous suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors, and ""if I start cutting again"" suggests recurring self-harm. Imminence is indicated with ""One of these days"" and ""at the moment there is too much potential interference,"" showing future intent with current barriers. The writer expresses a clear desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I'll finally do it,"" ""I wish I could die in my sleep""). There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""hang myself"" and ""cutting again"" (as a means to increase COVID risk). Preparations are indicated by ""figured out how to properly hang myself,"" showing planning and knowledge acquisition. This suggests elements of Behavior, but the analysis must consider past actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past events: ""I've done it many times"" refers to previous suicidal actions (e.g., attempts or self-harm), which are concrete and potentially lethal based on the context of ""killing myself."" It also expresses future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it""). However, the key factor is the description of past initiated actions (""I've done it many times""), which aligns with the Attempt category definition of historic, potentially lethal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out Indicator. The mention of methods and preparation could suggest Behavior, but the post clearly describes past suicidal actions (""I've done it many times""), which takes precedence per the rules. Even with current ideation/behavior, the description of concrete past attempts (interrupted or failed) fits Attempt best. ""I've done it many times"" implies initiated actions, not just thoughts, making it distinct from Ideation or Behavior.

For over the course of a year I've been having some thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all. Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all,"" explicitly referencing suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""feeling doomed,"" dread of ""something worse coming"" if they keep existing.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, notes).
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - Thoughts are described as persistent over a year but not framed as imminent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The desire is implied through the phrase ""end it all,"" but the phrasing (""thoughts telling me"") leans toward intrusive ideation rather than a stated personal *intent* to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""end it all"" (synonymous with suicide/killing oneself).
   - **Yes**: Expresses a desire to avoid future suffering by not existing (""something worse... if I kept existing"").
   - **No**: Does *not* state these thoughts are unwanted or explicitly resist them (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").
   - Conclusion: Explicit personal desire to die is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No specific method/plan**: No mention of tools (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note).
   - **No preparation**: Only describes thoughts, not actions taken toward suicide.
   - Conclusion: Lacks elements for 'Behavior'. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes ongoing thoughts (past year) but **no initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took steps"").
   - Focus is on persistent ideation, not a recent/past attempt.
   - Conclusion: No evidence for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it all"") + dread of existence → Suicidal intent is present.
   - No plan/method/preparation → Excludes 'Behavior'.
   - No description of concrete past/recent actions → Excludes 'Attempt'.
   - Meets 'Ideation' criteria: Personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire without actionable details.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""lost cause,"" ""I'm in hell""), self-loathing (""useless, shameless, pathetic loser,"" ""useless piece of garbage""), and despair about life circumstances (depression, anxiety, family conflicts, lack of relationships). It explicitly references past suicidal actions: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor... But I chickened out each time."" These are specific methods (drowning, hanging, jumping) and indicate initiated but aborted actions. The emotional tone is one of persistent distress and a desire to die (e.g., ""Why should I still live""), but no current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The suicidal references are historical, with the user describing themselves as having failed due to fear.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""Why should I still live"" and the context of despair. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, they are recounted as acted upon in the past. This rules out 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is a genuine wish to die, not just distress about thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods (drowning, hanging, jumping) are mentioned, but only in the context of past actions. There is no indication of a current plan, method, or preparation for future suicide. The focus is on historical attempts, not ongoing behavior. Thus, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior', which requires current or future planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past events: concrete, self-initiated actions (trying to drown, hang, and jump) that were potentially lethal but interrupted by the user (""chickened out""). This fits the 'Attempt' category definition, which includes past or recent initiated actions, even if aborted or failed. No current or imminent suicidal action is described, but the past attempts are clear and detailed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond 'Indicator' (no explicit suicidal desire) and 'Ideation' (desire without plan/action), as it details past suicidal actions. It does not qualify as 'Behavior' because there is no current plan or preparation mentioned—only historical references. The description of multiple past initiated actions (drowning, hanging, jumping) that were potentially lethal but stopped aligns with 'Attempt'. Per the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when past concrete actions are described, even if current ideation is present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense frustration with life, hopelessness (""Living is not for me""), crippling anxiety, family issues, and dropping out of school/work.  
   - Explicitly references suicide: ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15,"" ""I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" and ""might actually get the courage to do it.""  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (""Living is just so frustrating""), burden (""relationship with my mom sucks""), and anhedonia (""doing nothing for the past year"").  
   - **Desire to die**: Clear personal wish (""I would have been gone..."").  
   - **Plan/method**: None specified (e.g., no tools, locations, or preparations mentioned).  
   - **Temporal context**: Past desire (""when I was 15"") and current/future intent (""becoming more confident,"" ""might... do it""), but no description of initiated actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""I would have been gone,"" and ""get the courage to do it"" show a current, personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The focus is on gaining ""courage,"" not concrete plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past ideation (""would have been gone at 15"") and current ideation/future intent.  
   - **No initiated action**: No description of a past or recent attempt (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned; ""courage to do it"" implies intent but lacks specificity. Thus, **Ideation**.  
   - **Attempt**: No described initiated action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""be dead in less than 24 hours,"" ""if you wanted to die you would.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain is too much,"" despair implied by planning death.
   - Specific plan/method: Mentions having ""enough Trazodone"" (method: overdose) and planning to ""get alcohol today"" (preparation). Explicit timeline: ""dead in less than 24 hours.""
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""be dead"") with no negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: ""be dead"" directly expresses a desire to die. No indication these thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - Yes: Specific method (Trazodone overdose + alcohol) and preparation (""have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes future intent (""will get,"" ""be dead in less than 24 hours""), not a past or ongoing action. No initiated lethal action described (e.g., no ""I took pills"" or ""I tried"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation + imminent timeline = **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: No past/ongoing lethal action (so not Attempt). Plan/method is explicit (so not Ideation). Desire is personal and current (so not Indicator).

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep hopelessness (""things are going to get better, and they don't,"" ""the rest is just darkness""), despair (""I want to give up,"" ""My life has no worth. No meaning""), feelings of worthlessness (""I bring nothing to the table""), and guilt for feeling this way. It references past abuse and long-term struggles but does not mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or any specific methods/means. There are no indications of a plan, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer describes ""obsessive negative thoughts"" and a desire to ""give up,"" but this is framed in the context of emotional exhaustion rather than a clear intent to die. The question ""Why the fuck am I alive"" suggests distress about existence but not an explicit wish for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No, the post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. While phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why am I alive"" imply distress, they do not constitute a clear, personal expression of a desire to die. The writer expresses tiredness of negative thoughts but does not state these thoughts are suicidal or unwanted in the context of resisting suicide (e.g., no phrasing like ""I have thoughts of suicide but don't want to act""). This ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No, there is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations for suicide. The focus is on emotional and cognitive struggles, not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses ongoing and past emotional struggles but does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm). The content is reflective and general, not tied to a specific event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows strong indicators of distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) but lacks an explicit, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt. The phrase ""I want to give up"" is vague and could relate to emotional surrender rather than suicide, and the absence of direct suicidal language or intent places this in 'Indicator'. Per the rules, ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire defaults to 'Indicator'. There is no basis for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires a described action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""let myself pass away,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""I'm going to die.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (planning death to ""cushion the pain"" for others), fixation on extreme weight loss as a means to die.
   - Specific method/preparation: Using anorexia to reach a lethal weight (78 pounds or lower), with clear intent to die via starvation (""slowly kill myself this way""). Preparation includes setting a ""new goal weight"" and rationalizing the timeline.
   - Imminence: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but active progression toward a lethal outcome.
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""kill me,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" and ""I'm going to die"" in a context of personal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes. A specific method (starvation via anorexia targeting 78 pounds or lower) and preparation (setting goal weights, strategizing the timeline) are explicitly described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a *future* plan (""I'm going to,"" ""new goal weight""), not a past or recent initiated action. No indication of a prior attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The presence of a specific method (starvation to death) and preparations (adjusting goal weight, planning the progression) supports 'Behavior'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No description of a past/current *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I restricted until I passed out yesterday""). The focus is on planning future actions.  
   - **Conclusion:** Fits 'Behavior' due to suicidal desire combined with a clear method and preparatory steps.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and a specific method: using a charcoal BBQ in a tent, which implies carbon monoxide poisoning as a means.
   - There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, or burden expressed. The post is phrased as a factual question about feasibility.
   - No specific plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.
   - The writer's stated desire is unclear; it is an inquiry about possibility, not a personal expression of intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" directly.
   - However, it does not express a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The phrasing is impersonal and interrogative, focusing on the method's viability rather than the author's intent.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or distressing, but also not claimed as a current personal desire, this leans toward ambiguity. The lack of personal expression of desire suggests 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method is mentioned (charcoal BBQ in a tent), but it is not presented as part of the author's plan or preparation. The question is about possibility, not intention (e.g., no ""I plan to use this"").
   - No signs of preparation are indicated.
   - The presence of a method alone does not constitute 'Behavior' without a personal expression of suicidal desire or planning context. Unsure if this is an explicit plan, so default to 'Ideation' per rules, but desire is missing.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes no past, current, or future actions. It is purely a question about hypothetical feasibility.
   - No initiated or completed actions are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly by inquiring about a method but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author. This fits 'Indicator' (general distress or abstract discussion without personal desire).
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of wanting to die (e.g., ""I wish I wasn't here"").
   - 'Behavior' is not applicable because, although a method is mentioned, there is no accompanying personal suicidal desire or explicit plan.
   - 'Attempt' is irrelevant as no actions are described.
   - Ambiguity exists due to the method mention, but the absence of personal desire and the rule to choose 'Indicator' in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' applies.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it""), self-loathing (""everything about me is wrong""), feelings of being a burden (""everyone would be better off without dealing with me""), and worthlessness (""don't deserve anything"").  
   - **Explicit negation of suicidal action**: The author states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die.""  
   - **No mentions of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts**. References to death are abstract (""want to die"") but immediately qualified as not actionable.  
   - Focus is on emotional pain and perceived burdensomeness, not actionable intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit suicidal intent**: While phrases like ""everything makes me want to die"" suggest ideation, the author explicitly negates desire to act (""I don't feel like actually committing die""). Suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted distress rather than a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No references to methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions described**. Mentions of life circumstances (e.g., weight loss, past relationship) are contextual, not behavioral.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress about unwanted thoughts** (""want to die"" is countered by ""not committing""), aligning with 'Indicator'.  
   - Absence of plan/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. Lack of actionable desire or specific suicidal intent rules out 'Ideation'. No described past acts rule out 'Attempt'.  
   - Ambiguity in ""want to die"" is resolved by explicit rejection of action, favoring 'Indicator' per rules.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of emotional distress: ""My heart hurts,"" ""I feel like the worst person,"" and hopelessness about the relationship (""I feel like I don't know if that's possible"").  
   - **Direct suicidal expressions**: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""I just feel like dying."" These indicate a personal desire to die.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation**: No mention of specific tools, locations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or actions (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  
   - **No past actions**: No reference to prior suicide attempts or self-harm.  
   - **Context**: Suicidal thoughts stem from relational despair, but the writer seeks connection (""I wish I had someone to talk to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I feel like I don't want to live"" show a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans (""I will do X tomorrow""), or preparations (e.g., ""I bought a rope"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional pain and suicidal thoughts but **no past or recent suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die places this beyond **Indicator** (which requires absence of personal suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of initiated actions (past or present) rules out **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** fits: clear expressions of suicidal desire (""I want to die"") without plans, methods, or actions.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness (""Nothing's real to me anymore""), self-loathing (""I'm an abomination""), and intrusive thoughts about violence toward others and desiring trauma/illness.  
   - Metaphors are used extensively (e.g., comparing self to a ""sick dog"" waiting to be ""put down""), implying a passive wish for an end to suffering.  
   - **No explicit mentions** of suicide, self-harm, death, or dying. The closest reference is the metaphorical ""put down,"" which is not literal.  
   - Desires expressed focus on *wanting trauma/illness for validation* or *violent thoughts toward others*, not a personal wish to die.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide/self-harm are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The post lacks phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent direct expressions. The ""put down"" metaphor is contextualized as a comparison to an animal's suffering, not a declaration of personal suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations for self-harm/suicide are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and intrusive thoughts but **no concrete past or imminent suicidal actions**. The ""3 weeks"" deadline references a desire for life to ""turn around,"" not a suicide plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core content reflects **severe distress, hopelessness, and unwanted violent/intrusive thoughts** (e.g., ""Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone?"").  
   - The metaphor of being ""put down"" suggests passive despair but **lacks a clear, personal desire to die by suicide**.  
   - No evidence of active suicidal ideation, planning, or behavior. Primary themes are emotional pain, confusion, and a plea for validation.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress is evident, but suicidal intent is absent, indirect, or explicitly negated (e.g., wanting trauma/illness instead of death).

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" and ""drafted my will"" as preparations.  
   - Expresses emotional distress (e.g., ""torment of thoughts,"" ""tired,"" ""delicate,"" feeling ""wired different"").  
   - Explicitly denies intent: ""I don't think I would do 'it'.""  
   - Describes no initiated lethal actions (only planning/prep).  
   - States being in counseling and relief from current ideation (""out of my hole for now"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""plotting my suicide.""  
   - Desire is partially negated (""I don't think I would do 'it'""), but the planning indicates lingering intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Plotting my suicide"" implies ongoing planning.  
   - **Yes**: Specific preparation (""drafted my will"").  
   - Methods are vaguely referenced (e.g., avoiding weapons/household items), but no imminent plan is stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past/ongoing planning** (""months"") and preparation (""yesterday"").  
   - **No initiated lethal action**: Only discusses thoughts/preparations, not concrete attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire (""plotting my suicide"") and emotional distress confirm **Ideation/Behavior**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: ""Plotting"" implies active planning, and ""drafted my will"" is preparation → **Behavior**.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No description of initiated lethal actions → Not **Attempt**.  
   - Despite ambivalence (""I don't think I would do 'it'""), the presence of planning/preparation overrides and fits **Behavior**.

   - Mentions feeling mocked for depression and experiencing repeated boundary violations by ""Z.""  
   - Expresses frustration and exhaustion (""i am so sick of this,"" ""i want it to stop"").  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods**. The strongest statement is ""i want it to stop,"" referring to the interpersonal conflict, not life.

   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or timelines** for self-harm/suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""

   - **Conclusion**: No explicit/implicit desire to die. Leans toward *Indicator*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing relational conflict and distress. **No past/recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

   - The burden statement and despair are concerning but fit *Indicator* (general distress without suicidal intent).  
   - **No ambiguity**: Explicit suicidal desire is absent, so not *Ideation*. No plan/method, so not *Behavior*. No past action, so not *Attempt*.

   - The post expresses intense anger, betrayal, exhaustion, and hopelessness (""i'm so tired,"" ""sucked my soul out dry,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"").  
   - References to childhood trauma (""things to a child""), abandonment, and despair about the world are present.  
   - **No explicit mention of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations**. Phrases like ""it's finally over"" and ""give us all some peace"" imply emotional exhaustion but lack direct suicidal intent.  
   - The anger is directed externally (""FUCK YOU""), and the writer describes feeling ""sick"" due to another's actions, not self-inflicted harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The post contains no phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent expressions. Despair is evident, but the desire for death is not personally claimed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses significant distress: feelings of stagnation, hopelessness (""nothing is going to change""), isolation (""pushed friends away""), and worthlessness (""nothing going for me"").  
   - **Explicitly negates suicidal intent**: Opens with ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" and later states, ""I really want to give life a chance.""

   - Expresses hopelessness (""Life gets more overwhelming,"" ""can't get myself to do anything,"" ""in a rut"") and self-perceived weakness (""too weak and pathetic"").  
   - Specifies timing (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") and implies isolation (""small support system"").  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - Desire to die is explicit but conflicted (""I know I shouldn't"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - The desire is personal and current, despite internal conflict (""I know I shouldn't"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions emotional distress: feeling ""dead inside,"" ""sad,"" ""anhedonic,"" hopelessness (""beyond saving""), and worthlessness (""useless life"").
    - Explicit suicidal reference: ""yeet myself"" is slang for self-harm/suicide, indicating a desire to act.
    - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeline, or past actions described. ""Yeet myself"" is vague and lacks concrete details (tools, location, substance, etc.).
    - Focuses on current emotional state and unwanted feelings (""I just want to cry""), but the phrase ""yeet myself way too much"" expresses an active desire to act on suicidal urges.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - ""Yeet myself"" is a direct colloquial reference to suicide/self-harm. The phrase ""way too much"" underscores a current, personal desire to act. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"") or expression of these thoughts as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is too vague to constitute a plan.

    - Describes current feelings and ideation (""I just want to...""). No mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted efforts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Indicator** is ruled out because the post expresses a personal, active desire to act (""yeet myself""), not just distress or abstract/unwanted thoughts.  
    - **Behavior** is not met due to the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation.  
    - **Attempt** is not applicable—no initiated lethal action is described.  
    - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly voices a desire to die/act (""yeet myself"") but provides no concrete plan or method. The slang implies intent without specificity, aligning with the threshold for Ideation.

But now i fucked up and i might lose my license. If i lose my job because of it I might have to move back home with my parents as a 24 year old now. God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses distress about life circumstances (potentially losing license, job, moving back home), feelings of failure (""I'm such a fucking loser""), and isolation (""All my friends are judgmental assholes""). Crucially, it references a past suicide attempt: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes I wish I succeeded."" There are no mentions of current suicidal plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions. The phrase ""end it"" is a euphemism for suicide, and ""wish I succeeded"" indicates regret about the past attempt not resulting in death. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present, but the suicidal content is focused on a historical event.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicidal intent through ""I tried to end it once before,"" which implies a personal desire to die in the past. The phrase ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" expresses a current, passive wish related to that past desire, but it does not state a clear, current, active desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die now""). However, the core suicidal expression is tied to a described past action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""tried to end it"" is vague and lacks details about means, tools, location, or preparations for the past attempt. Since there is no indication of current planning, this aspect does not support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""I tried to end it once before"" indicates a concrete, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal (as it was an attempt). The addition of ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" reflects on that past event but does not describe a new or imminent action. The rules state that if a past attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' takes precedence, even if current distress or ideation is present.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post does not fit 'Indicator' because it includes an explicit personal expression of a past suicidal act and desire, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because while there is a current passive wish (""Sometimes I wish I succeeded""), the primary focus is on a described past action, not current thoughts without action.
   - It does not fit 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a current plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - It fits 'Attempt' because the content clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action (""tried to end it""). The rules specify that 'Attempt' applies to such descriptions, even if the attempt was in the past and is referenced alongside current feelings.

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I just wanna kill myself"" as a direct expression of suicidal intent driven by fear during a panic attack.
   - Emotional indicators include acute distress (""bad panic attack"") and hopelessness (""out of fear"").
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No past actions or attempts are described. The statement is present-tense and focused on current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, personal declaration of suicidal desire. The author does not negate or express unwillingness to act on these thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don’t want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan details, or preparatory actions are mentioned. The statement is solely about the *desire* to die.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current emotional state (panic attack) and concurrent suicidal desire. There is no reference to past/ongoing actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). The phrase ""wanna"" indicates intent but not initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of a concrete, initiated action rules out **Attempt**.
   - The distress and fear support emotional urgency but do not override the explicit suicidal intent, so **Indicator** is inappropriate.

157,"Thought I was doing better. Now my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with. Every time I am back here, I feel more and more defeated. I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: The post mentions ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with"" and expresses hopelessness (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle"") and defeat. Phrases like ""why keep going?"" suggest despair.
    - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations. Emotional indicators (hopelessness, defeat) are present, but suicidal intent is framed as an intrusive thought (""my brain is screaming at me"").
    - The writer describes recurring distress but no actions, timelines, or concrete plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" The closest phrase (""get it over with"") is ambiguous and could refer to ending suffering rather than life.
    - The desire to die is attributed to intrusive thoughts (""my brain is screaming""), not a personal wish. The framing suggests distress about unwanted thoughts rather than genuine intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
    - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The focus is on internal struggle, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
    - Describes a current emotional state and recurring feelings (""every time I am back here""). No past or recent actions, attempts, or initiations of self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - The core issue is distress about intrusive suicidal thoughts (""my brain is screaming"") without personal endorsement of the desire to die. This aligns with **Indicator**, which captures unwanted suicidal thoughts or general despair without explicit intent. Absence of a plan/method rules out **Behavior**/**Attempt**, and the lack of clear personal desire to die distinguishes it from **Ideation**.

158,"Please help. I'm really annoyed at people making fun at my spiritual beliefs like crystals, astrology, tarot, ect. And it happens A LOT. They just make me feel stupid for believing in something that not many people believe in. And it's not like any of them would stop and think about what they're doing, because they think we're just 'crazy' people that they can just make fun of for their entertainment. And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses distress from others mocking the author's spiritual beliefs, leading to feelings of stupidity, being offended, and crying.
   - Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""they just make me feel stupid"") and despair, but there is no mention of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm, or specific plans/means.
   - The phrase ""this is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts"" explicitly references suicidal thoughts, but it does not describe a desire to die, specific plans, methods, preparations, or any past actions. The context is the author expressing distress about external events, not detailing suicidal intent or behavior.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is indicated. The author seeks help (""Please help"") and ends with gratitude (""Thank you for listening""), suggesting a focus on venting distress rather than acting on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" but it does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself""). The suicidal thoughts are presented as a consequence of distress (""one of the reasons""), not as a stated wish to act on them. The author does not negate or state that these thoughts are unwanted, but the overall tone is one of distress rather than intent, leaning toward 'Indicator' due to the lack of explicit desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The reference to suicidal thoughts is general and lacks any planning element, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""currently have suicidal thoughts"") with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated self-harm). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and mentions suicidal thoughts, but it lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The suicidal thoughts are framed as a symptom of distress rather than an active wish, creating ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire. Per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'. The absence of a plan, method, or preparation also supports 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. No past actions indicate 'Attempt'.

So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""end it,"" and ""no choice but to end it,"" indicating suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'll never be happy if I continue to live""), despair (""I can't change my circumstances""), anger, and sadness about missing out on life. There is a clear personal desire to die due to perceived unavoidable circumstances.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence: The post uses ""planning"" but lacks specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").  
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a genuine wish to die (e.g., ""I have to go"") without indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""planning to commit suicide"" and ""end it.""  
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it"").  
   - No, the suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are presented as a necessary outcome.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means).  
   - The word ""planning"" is used but is vague and unspecific, so it does not constitute an explicit plan for classification purposes.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""planning to commit suicide"") but no past or recent actions.  
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt or interrupted action).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die with explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires a lack of genuine desire or explicit suicidal intent).  
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such details).  
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.  
   - Given the explicit suicidal desire without a plan or method, this aligns with 'Ideation'. The ambiguity around ""planning"" does not rise to the level of a concrete plan, and the rules state to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan/method.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice: as an alternative to moving back home (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") and as an action narrowly avoided (""I was so close to attempting suicide"").  
   - Emotional indicators: regret, embarrassment, dread, feeling ""mentally unstable,"" nausea, and despair about living with family.  
   - No specific method/plan/preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, or notes mentioned).  
   - Describes a past point of crisis (""so close to attempting"") but clarifies this was avoided by texting their mom.  
   - No initiated lethal action occurred—texting the mom interrupted the potential attempt.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""attempting suicide"" as a considered alternative and states they were ""so close"" to it.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal intent is clear, no specific method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past crisis point** where suicide was imminent (""so close"") but **no action was initiated**. The act of texting their mom prevented the attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is stated (""attempting suicide"" as an alternative), meeting criteria for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of any described plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated lethal action occurred (only averted by seeking help), ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - The focus is on current distress and past suicidal thoughts with intent, not abstract/unwanted thoughts, so **Indicator** does not fit.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""I cant take it,"" ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything,"" and ""Its excruciating,"" indicating despair and hopelessness.
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""I wont kill myself of course"" directly negates any intention or desire to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present.
   - The writer's stated desire is clear: they do not want to die (""I wont kill myself of course""), framing the suicidal reference as an unwanted thought rather than a current personal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned, but it is immediately negated (""of course""), showing no genuine desire to die. The primary sentiment is distress about emotional pain, with the suicidal thought presented as rejected or unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The focus is on emotional anguish, not planning or acting on suicidal thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings only, with no reference to past or imminent actions. No initiated suicidal act is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit negation of suicidal intent (""I wont kill myself of course"") and lack of desire to die align with 'Indicator'. The mention of suicide is abstract and unwanted, fitting the definition of expressing distress without a current personal suicidal desire. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Ideation', and no past action, ruling out 'Attempt'. Ambiguity about desire leans toward 'Indicator' per guidelines.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses distress related to gender dysphoria, societal beauty standards, and a desire to transition genders (""I want to be a male now""). Key elements include:
   - Emotional indicators: Obsession over appearance, intensified dysphoria, hatred of feminine-coded activities (makeup/clothing).
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.
   - Focus is on identity distress and transition desire, not lethality or self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents.
   - **No expression** of a desire to die, not be alive, or end life (e.g., ""I want to be gone"" is absent).
   - Distress is channeled into a wish for gender transition (""I want to be a male""), not death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparatory acts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes **current emotional struggles** only. No past/recent suicidal actions or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses psychological distress (gender dysphoria) but **lacks personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.
   - All criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' are unmet. Falls under **'Indicator'** as it reflects general distress without suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""hate myself,"" ""wish I had the courage to end it all,"" and ""loathe my existence,"" indicating despair and explicit suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""some days aren’t as good"") and internal conflict (""I wish I had the courage... but... I want the courage to endure"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context: Desires are generalized (e.g., ""wish I had the courage""), not imminent (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - Stated desire: Expresses a *wish* to die but explicitly lacks intent/action due to ""not having courage.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""end it all"" directly imply suicide.  
   - **Yes**: Desire to die is clear (""wish I had the courage to end it all"").  
   - **No**: Though conflicted, the writer does *not* explicitly state suicidal thoughts are unwanted or separate from their desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method**: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or plans.  
   - **No preparation**: No references to notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings but **no past/initiated actions**. Focus is on *wishing* for courage, not acting.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""end it all"") places this beyond vague distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned; only desires/thoughts.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No actionable steps or past attempts described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits **Ideation**—explicit suicidal desire without plans/preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""almost committed suicide"" and ""still consider"".
   - Describes a past event (""a few days ago"") where suicidal action was initiated but aborted due to lacking means (""didn't have anything to do it with"").
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation details provided (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned).
   - Emotional distress is evident (anxiety severity, family conflict, isolation), but the suicidal reference is personal and action-oriented.
   - The phrase ""almost committed suicide"" implies an initiated action, not just ideation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: ""committed suicide"" is a direct phrase, and ""still consider"" confirms ongoing suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method or preparation is described (only a general reference to lacking means). Thus, not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""almost committed suicide"") that was interrupted (due to lacking means). This fits the 'Attempt' definition (initiated action, even if aborted).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The key phrase ""almost committed suicide"" indicates a concrete, past suicidal action by the author that was initiated but not completed. This meets the 'Attempt' criteria (initiated potentially lethal action). Current distress (""still consider"") doesn't override this, as past concrete actions take precedence per the rules. No plan/method details shift it from 'Behavior' to 'Attempt' due to the described action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post repeatedly uses the word ""suicide"" directly (""suicide with me,"" ""suicide together,"" ""want to suicide"").  
   - It expresses a desire for others to join in a suicidal act, implying a personal intent to die.  
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness) or specific methods/preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - There is no reference to past actions or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer does not express these thoughts as unwanted or negate the desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""suicide with me"" and ""can anyone suicide with me together"" explicitly reference suicide and indicate a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While the post seeks collaboration, it lacks any mention of a specific method (e.g., tools, location), preparation (e.g., acquiring means), or timeline.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""can anyone suicide with me"") but **no past or recent initiated action** (e.g., an attempt) is mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** is present (suicide is directly mentioned and invited), so it cannot be 'Indicator'.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is specified (only a general call for joint action), so it cannot be 'Behavior'.  
   - **No concrete past/current action** is described, so it cannot be 'Attempt'.

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal actions: ""I want to kms,"" ""hang myself,"" ""kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling like a burden to family/friends/coworkers, hopelessness (""It is what I deserve""), and fear of failing.  
   - **Specific method**: Hanging (using a rope).  
   - **Preparation**: Mentioned packing the apartment, resigning from a job, and setting aside money—though not completed.  
   - **Past action**: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two."" This is a concrete, self-initiated act.  
   - **Temporal context**: The action (""practice hung"") occurred very recently (implied by ""I just got home from work""). Current desire to ""try again"" is also expressed.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases include ""I want to kms,"" ""hang myself,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""can’t stop thinking about killing myself."" The desire to die is personal and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method**: Hanging (specifies using a rope).  
   - **Preparation**: ""Practice hung"" action and detailed plans (packing, resigning), though incomplete.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent action**: Putting a rope around their neck and hanging for ""a minute or two"" before stopping. This is a potentially lethal act that was initiated and interrupted (by self).  
   - Current ideation/urge (""can’t focus on anything except trying again"") is present, but the *concrete past action* takes precedence.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The ""practice hung"" action meets the **Attempt** definition: A self-initiated, potentially lethal act (hanging) that was stopped but could have caused death.  
   - Even though preparations (packing, etc.) are incomplete, the physical act of testing the method elevates it beyond *Behavior* (plan/preparation) to *Attempt* (initiated action).  
   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to past attempts... it should be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" Here, the action is explicit and recent.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains multiple explicit expressions of suicidal desire: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""I don't want to be here any more.""  
   - Emotional indicators include intense hopelessness (""I'm a fucking failure""), despair (non-stop crying), perceived burdensomeness (""I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden""), and isolation (feeling uncared for by fiancé and mother).  
   - A **specific method** is mentioned: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun,"" though uncertainty is noted (""I don't know exactly how"").  
   - No concrete **preparations** (e.g., acquiring a gun) or **past actions** (e.g., prior attempts) are described. The focus is on current/future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""violently suicidal,"" ""I want to fucking die,"" and ""go through with it"" confirm a personal desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. A specific method (firearm) is explicitly referenced as a considered means, despite uncertainty about execution. This meets the threshold for 'Behavior' (mention of a method).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""finally going to do it,"" ""I think I know I'm going to go through with it"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal actions**. References to past ideation (""my suicidal ideation"") lack actionable events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit desire to die and personal suicidal intent are present.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: While suicidal desire is clear, the mention of a specific method (gun) pushes this beyond ideation.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific method (gun) = 'Behavior' (even with uncertainty about execution).

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicidal intent: ""I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing""), numbness (""sleep and be numb""), and isolation.
   - Specific method/location: Mountains (commonly associated with jumping/isolated suicide).
   - Preparation: Traveling to the location with clear intent (""full intentions to end things"").
   - Past/recent action: Describes a concrete, self-initiated action (driving to mountains) undertaken to attempt suicide.
   - Imminence: The action occurred very recently (""just finished driving"").
   - Ambivalence: States ""I don't think I'm going to do it"" after the action, indicating self-interruption.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: ""end things"" directly implies suicide in this context. The phrase ""full intentions to end things"" confirms personal desire to die at the time of the action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes: Mountains serve as a location for the plan. Traveling there constitutes preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a recent, concrete, potentially lethal action: Driving to the mountains with suicidal intent. This action was initiated and completed, though interrupted by their own change of mind (""I don’t think I’m going to do it""). Self-interrupted actions still qualify as attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The core of the post describes a **recent, initiated suicidal action** (traveling to the mountains to die), making this an 'Attempt' under the definition.  
   - Despite current ambivalence and no lethal outcome, the author undertook a specific, potentially lethal action.  
   - 'Behavior' would apply if planning without action, but the act of traveling to the location shifts this to 'Attempt'.  
   - Rules precedence: Past/recent concrete actions override current ideation/ambivalence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""ready to die"" and ""go out,"" indicating a desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing"") and rejection of the world (""Fuck this world""). There are references to a specific plan: ""The date was set a while ago"" and ""changed it,"" showing planning. Preparations are explicitly stated: ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want."" The phrase ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" may imply a method but is vague. Imminence is suggested by the set date and readiness, but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is given. The desire to die is clear and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""ready to go."" There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the tone is resolved and accepting. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, the post mentions a specific plan: ""The date was set a while ago"" and ""I even changed it,"" indicating scheduling. Preparations are directly stated: ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want."" While no explicit method (e.g., pills, gun) is detailed, the references to a set date and ongoing preparations constitute a plan. This leans toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past planning (""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it"") and current/future intentions (""I'm ready,"" ""Preps being made""). It does not describe any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took""). The focus is on planning and preparation for a future act, not a past or recent attempt. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die, placing this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire). The presence of a set date and explicit preparations (""Preps being made"") moves this from 'Ideation' (thoughts without plan) to 'Behavior' (thoughts with plan/preparation). Since no concrete, initiated action is described, it is not 'Attempt'. The vague reference to method (""strapped in"") does not override the explicit plan and preps, and the rules state to choose 'Behavior' when preparations are mentioned.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" explicitly mentioning suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (disliking vocational course, limited choices), isolation (friends ditching them), and distress (past OCD/depression, ongoing struggles).  
   - **No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - **No references to past actions** (e.g., prior attempts) or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer expresses a **genuine desire to die** (""ending my life"") without stating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""ending my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**, the desire to die is personal and current. No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** method, plan, tools, or preparations are described. The statement remains at the level of thought.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on past struggles (OCD, school expulsion) and current distress.  
   - **No description** of initiated suicidal actions (past or recent).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""ending my life"") qualifies for **Ideation** or higher.  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current concrete actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** fits best: personal desire to die expressed, but no plan/method/preparation indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains the phrase ""pls let me never wake up,"" which directly expresses a desire to not regain consciousness (i.e., to die).  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""hopefully this is my last post"") and a clear wish for permanent escape.  
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence is implied (""never wake up"") but not time-bound (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The desire to die is explicit and not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - While ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly used, phrases like ""never wake up"" and ""last post"" convey a direct desire to cease living.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine wish to die (no negation like ""I don’t want this"").  
   → **Yes**, explicit intent is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned.  
   → **No plan/preparation indicators**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post describes a future-oriented wish (""let me never wake up"") but **no past or recent initiated action** (e.g., ""I tried last night"").  
   - No description of concrete suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (""never wake up""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The plea for death is personal and explicit, distinguishing it from **Indicator** (which requires ambiguity about intent or unwanted thoughts).  
   → **Ideation** is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions having ""42 unnamed pills"" and ""some allergy medicine,"" which are specific methods for potential overdose. It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""antidepressants didn't work"") and despair (""i feel like im always posting here""). There is a clear plan with imminent timing (""tonight im gonna do it"") and preparations (""i actually have the means to""). The writer expresses a strong desire to die (""im so ready to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""im gonna do it"" (implying suicide) and ""im so ready to die,"" showing a clear, personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method (overdosing on pills) is mentioned, along with details about the pills (e.g., type, ease of swallowing). Preparations are evident (""i have the means to""). This moves beyond mere thoughts to actionable planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight im gonna do it"") but no past or recent initiated action. The writer references past ideation (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") but no concrete, lethal action was taken, so this is not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a specific method, preparations, and imminent plan rules out 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan). As no action has been initiated (only planned), it is not 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a plan and preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feelings of loneliness, being unwanted, hopelessness (""I want to be done,"" ""tire of being an unwanted nuisance,"" ""I don't feel like anyone loves me"").  
   - Explicitly mentions suicidal intent: ""kill myself"" is directly stated as a perceived solution to end suffering (""the only way... would be to just be done and kill myself"").  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  
   - The desire to die is framed as a consequence of unresolved pain, not explicitly rejected (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly used.  
   - **Yes**: The context (""I want to be done,"" ""kill myself"") shows a personal desire to escape suffering through death.  
   - **No**: Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; they are presented as a logical outcome of despair.

   - Describes current/future suicidal thoughts (""would be to... kill myself"") but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - The absence of any method, plan, or preparation rules out *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post repeatedly expresses a strong desire to ""check out"" (a common euphemism for suicide/death) and explicitly states, ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""spite has its limits"") and disconnection from consequences (""not that I have any moral problem with suicide... or care about what it would do to others"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - The writer acknowledges being held back by ""spite"" but emphasizes this restraint is fading. There is **no mention of past actions** (e.g., no description of initiated self-harm).  
   - Desire to die is explicit and personal but framed as restrained by circumstance, not unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** ""Check out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in context. The writer states a personal, current desire to die (""I really want to check out"") and rejects moral/social barriers to acting on it. The thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted or distressing intrusions (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No.** No mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The focus is solely on the *desire* to die and the weakening restraint.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""want to check out,"" ""spite has its limits""). **No past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation** fits: The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to check out"") and suicidal intent, but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. The absence of these elements rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **Not Indicator**: The desire to die is explicit and not negated (e.g., no ""I don’t actually want to die"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/current concrete self-harm actions.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No mention of how, when, or preparations for acting on the desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress (""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain,"" ""i cant handle it anymore"").  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is indicated with ""im going to do it"" and finality (""im done"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""thank you to the people"" and ""hope everyone finds something to live for"" resembles a goodbye message but lacks concrete evidence of preparatory actions.  
   - No past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""im going to do it"" strongly implies a personal intent to commit suicide without ambiguity. The author does not negate or express unwanted thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don’t want to""). **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., ""wrote a note,"" ""bought pills"") are mentioned. The goodbye is contextual but not a tangible preparation. **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post focuses on future intent (""im going to do it""), not past actions. No initiated/lethal act (e.g., ""I took pills"") is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit desire to die (""im going to do it"").  
   - **Behavior** is ruled out: No plan/method/preparation details exist.  
   - **Attempt** is ruled out: No description of past/recent initiated actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include stress (""I've got a lot of stress right now""), hopelessness (""I've never really seen myself going anywhere in life""), and a perceived ease in dying (""it would just be a lot easier"").
   - The query ""What is a mostly painless way to kill myself?"" implies consideration of methods, but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The method is hypothetical and not specified.
   - No references to past actions, such as previous attempts or preparations, are present.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the tone is contemplative.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""why not"") without stating that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die through statements like ""it would just be a lot easier"" and ""why not,"" with no negation of the desire.
   - There is no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""); instead, the writer rationalizes the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The post asks about a ""mostly painless way"" but does not specify a method, tool, substance, location, or plan. It is a general inquiry, not a statement of having or choosing a method.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are mentioned.
   - Since no explicit plan, method, or preparation is described, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'. The uncertainty about an explicit plan/method means 'Ideation' should be chosen over 'Behavior' per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current thoughts and future considerations, not past events. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of a past attempt or recent action that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""kill myself""), placing it beyond 'Indicator', which requires a lack of explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - It lacks a specific plan, method, or preparation, distinguishing it from 'Behavior'. The question about methods indicates ideation but not an actionable plan.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die without concrete plans or methods.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses suicide by overdose in detail, explaining why it's a painful and ineffective method.  
   - Mentions key phrases: ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" ""take the pills,"" and graphic descriptions of physical effects (vomiting, liver damage).  
   - Emotional tone is cautionary/educational, not personal despair. Phrases like ""Don’t take the pills"" are directives to others.  
   - No personal expression of hopelessness, desire to die, or burden. Instead, the author actively discourages suicide.  
   - No plans, preparations, or timelines for the author themselves.  
   - Focuses entirely on general risks, not the author’s experiences or intentions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned explicitly but **only in a general/third-party context** (e.g., ""tell you to not commit suicide"").  
   - **No personal desire to die** expressed by the author. The post emphasizes regret and harm to deter others.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are discussed as a hypothetical (""if you do end it""), not as the author’s current state.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (overdosing) are described but **only as warnings**, not as plans/preparations by the author.  
   - No tools, locations, or preparations mentioned for the author personally.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes hypothetical future scenarios (""you'll start vomiting"") and general outcomes.  
   - **No past or recent actions** by the author (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly discusses suicide but **lacks personal desire, intent, or action** from the author.  
   - Content is educational, abstract, and focused on deterring others, falling under **distress about suicide as a concept** (Indicator).  
   - Key distinction: The author’s voice is cautionary, not self-referential. Phrases like ""I’m not here to tell you..."" distance the author from endorsing suicide.  
   - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: ""Discusses suicide abstractly"" and ""lacks clear personal expression of desire to die.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions future suicidal intent (""im positive im gonna do it in the future,"" ""ill do it when im fed up"").  
   - Expresses desire to die due to lack of motivation to live, with only family concern as a barrier (""i truly have no motivation to keep on living other than i dont want my family to be sad"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No past/current actions (e.g., attempts) mentioned.  
   - Temporal context: Future-oriented (""not ready,"" ""gonna do it in the future,"" ""good rn"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Gonna do it"" implies intent to commit suicide. Desire to die is clear (""no motivation to keep on living"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up"").  
   - **No** description of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Clear desire to die (suicidal thoughts) → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No past/recent lethal actions → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under *Ideation*: Explicit personal desire to die (""gonna do it,"" ""no motivation to keep on living"") with no plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger and resentment towards the parents for bringing the author into existence.  
   - Key emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""living a life psychologically tortured""), despair, and feelings of neglect (""They couldn't even find the time to care for me"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - Focuses on existential suffering and parental failure, **not** personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Expresses anguish about existence (""hate my parents for having me"") but **no stated desire to end life**.  
   - Leans toward 'Indicator' due to absence of personal suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional pain. **No past or recent self-harm actions** (e.g., attempts, interrupted acts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress about life circumstances and parental neglect, **not** a desire to die.  
   - Lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. Falls squarely under 'Indicator' per rules:  
     > *""If suicidal intent isn't explicit... choose Indicator.""*  
     > *""Vague feelings about dying... fall here.""*

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes a vivid, violent nightmare involving mass murder, leading to a severe panic attack upon waking. The author expresses terror, lingering anxiety, and fear of sleeping due to intense dreams. Key elements include:  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Panic, terror, anxiety, fear of sleep.  
   - **Absence of suicidal elements**: No mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm directed at the self, no methods/preparations, no desire to die, and no references to past suicidal actions.  
   - **Focus**: Distress is centered on the nightmare's realism and its aftermath (anxiety about sleep).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.  
   - No discussion of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted). The distress stems from external dream content, not internal suicidal urges.  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of suicidal plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  
   - The violent imagery is contextualized as a dream, not a personal plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a past dream and current anxiety about sleep.  
   - No description of any self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (past or present).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **general distress** (panic, terror, sleep anxiety) triggered by a nightmare.  
   - **Lacks personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress is present, but without any suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.  
   - *Not Ideation/Behavior/Attempt*: No suicidal intent or actions identified.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-initiated suicidal action: ""overdosed twice... once on purpose.""  
   - Expresses despair (""fear and despair,"" ""end this suffering"") and a desire for relief (""give me the strength and a reason"").  
   - Implied suicidal intent: ""something to believe in so I can do it"" suggests ""do it"" refers to suicide, given the context of overdose and suffering.  
   - No explicit *current* plan/method/preparation beyond the plea for motivation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end this suffering"" + ""do it"" in context implies a desire to die. **Yes** (indirectly).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method referenced (""overdosed"") is tied to *past* actions. No current plan/preparation described (e.g., ""I will overdose tonight""). **No** for current behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Key element: ""overdosed twice... on purpose"" is a clear description of a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**. This meets the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - Current language (""give me strength to end this"") indicates distress/ideation but does **not** describe a new initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **concrete past suicide attempt** (intentional overdose), which takes precedence over current expressions of suffering or ideation per the rules.  
   - Distinction from 'Behavior': No current plan/method.  
   - Distinction from 'Ideation': The core of the post hinges on a disclosed past attempt.  
   - **'Attempt' applies** because the author explicitly references a self-initiated, potentially lethal action in their history.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" indicating a current personal expression of suicidal thoughts. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress over hurting their partner, fear of causing stress, and hopelessness linked to medication access issues. 
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, plans). 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions. The focus is on recurrent thoughts and emotional distress. 
   - The writer expresses unwanted recurrence of suicidal feelings (""I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again""), implying distress rather than active intent. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Directly uses ""suicidal"" to describe their current state. 
   - **No clear desire to act**: The context emphasizes distress about the *return* of these feelings and their impact on others, not a stated wish to die. The phrase ""I'm suicidal again"" signals recurrence of ideation, not intent. 
   - Unwanted thoughts are implied by contrasting with recent improvement and fear of burdening their partner. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific plan/method**: Mentions medication access issues but not as a means for self-harm. No tools, locations, or preparations described. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Focuses on *current* emotional state and thoughts, not past actions. 
   - **No initiated action**: No reference to attempts, aborted actions, or preparatory steps. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present (""I'm suicidal""), satisfying **Ideation**'s threshold for personal expression of desire. 
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out **Behavior**. 
   - **No past/recent concrete action** → Rules out **Attempt**. 
   - Distress about recurring thoughts and fear of burdening others aligns more with **Ideation** than **Indicator**, as the core admission (""I'm suicidal"") is a direct personal expression of current suicidal feelings. However, the lack of active desire to die or plan keeps it in **Ideation** (thoughts without plan). 
   - *Note*: If the phrase ""I'm suicidal"" were absent, this would be **Indicator** due to hopelessness/guilt. Its presence elevates it to **Ideation**, but ambiguity about *intent to act* prevents **Behavior**.

It's just too hard.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: anxiety, hopelessness (""I can't handle... she thinks I'm worthless""), feeling overwhelmed (""It's just too hard""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die more than ever""). 
   - No references to death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or locations (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight""). 
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills""). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as a current desire (""now I want to die more than ever""), not as unwanted or negated thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I want to die more than ever,"" indicating a personal desire to die. There is no statement rejecting this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**: No mention of a method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The focus is on emotional pain, not planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes current feelings and thoughts. No reference to past/recent suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly expresses a current desire to die (""I want to die more than ever"") and suicidal thoughts in a context of despair. 
   - Not **Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted. 
   - Not **Behavior**: No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. 
   - Not **Attempt**: No description of past/recent concrete suicidal actions.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions specific suicide method: ""suicide by hanging"".
   - Describes preparatory action: ""ive alr tied the noose"".
   - Expresses ambivalence (""im still not sure"") but no explicit negation of desire to die.
   - Asks about pain/duration, indicating consideration of the method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and describes preparatory behavior. Desire is implied but not directly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die""). However, the context of preparing a noose indicates serious engagement.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - Specific method: hanging.
   - Clear preparation: ""tied the noose"" (past action showing tangible step).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Preparation (tying noose) is complete but no initiated lethal action described (e.g., no mention of putting noose around neck or attempting to hang). Ambivalence (""still not sure"") suggests action hasn’t been taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit suicidal method + preparation places this in **Behavior**. The tied noose is a concrete preparatory act, distinct from passive ideation. No evidence of initiated lethal action (required for Attempt). Lack of explicit desire is overruled by method specificity and preparation.

185,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of suicide (""kill myself"") and a desire to die (""I want to die because of them""). Emotional indicators include distress, self-loathing (""I'm a pervert""), hopelessness (""I can't help my sexual feelings""), and the perception of being burdened by these feelings. There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). No past suicidal actions are described (e.g., the statement ""I've never done anything wrong or illegal"" refers to behavior, not suicide attempts). Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I want to die because of them""). There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not intend to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This confirms explicit suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The focus is on the desire to die and the reasons behind it, not on how or when it might happen. This absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. The writer states they have ""never done anything wrong or illegal,"" but this does not indicate a prior suicide attempt. Since no concrete, potentially lethal action has been initiated, this rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. It lacks any plan, method, or preparation, which distinguishes it from 'Behavior'. The absence of past suicidal actions rules out 'Attempt'. While there is emotional distress, the clear desire to die means it does not fit 'Indicator', which requires ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense anger and hatred towards family members, particularly the father, due to abandonment and historical sexual assault. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i hate everything""), despair, and a sense of injustice. The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" suggests suicidal intent, but it is vague and lacks specificity.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide, indicating a desire to die, but there is no explicit mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory steps (e.g., notes) are described.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong negative emotions (hatred, frustration) and trauma are present, contributing to distress, but the suicidal expression is brief and not elaborated.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None identified. ""End it"" implies a wish but no concrete details on how or when.
   - References to past actions: The sexual assault is mentioned, but it is not a suicidal action. No description of past self-harm, suicide attempts, or interrupted actions.
   - Imminence: No time frame (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is provided for suicidal intent.
   - Stated desire: ""i just wanna end it"" expresses a personal wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a clear indirect expression of a desire to die in a context of despair. The author personally states a wish not to be alive (""i just wanna end it""), and there is no negation (e.g., it's not framed as unwanted thoughts). Thus, explicit suicidal intent is present. (Yes)

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned or implied. ""End it"" is too vague to constitute a plan. Therefore, there is no evidence of planning or preparation. (No)

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past family events (abandonment, assault) but focuses on current emotional distress. The suicidal expression (""i just wanna end it"") is a present desire, not a description of a past or recent action. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted events) are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (""i just wanna end it""), which fits 'Ideation'. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. While the post includes general distress, the explicit suicidal intent moves it out of 'Indicator'. The rules state: if there is explicit desire to die with no plan/method, it is 'Ideation'. Ambiguity about desire would lean to 'Indicator', but here the desire is clear.

Final category: 'Ideation' (explicit personal desire to die, but no plan/method/preparation).

There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions ""brink of suicide"" in a general context (advising alternatives) and references past feelings of being unable to cope.  
   - Emotional indicators: Past hopelessness (""felt like I couldn't cope""), but current tone focuses on resilience and an alternative solution (vagrancy).  
   - No explicit desire to die, plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for suicide. Instead, vagrancy is framed as a *substitute* for suicide.  
   - Describes past actions (going vagrant) as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No explicit *personal* desire to die expressed (e.g., ""I want to die""). Mentions suicidal feelings only in past contexts as averted by vagrancy.  
   - The phrase ""brink of suicide"" is used abstractly/advising others, not describing the author’s current state.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - No plan, method, or preparation for suicide described. Vagrancy is discussed as an *alternative* to suicide, not a means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Past actions described (going vagrant) are non-suicidal coping behaviors, not initiated suicide attempts.  
   - No current or imminent suicidal intent/action indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses past distress and references suicidal feelings indirectly but lacks a **current personal desire to die**, specific plans, or suicidal actions.  
   - Focus is on sharing a survival strategy, not endorsing or planning suicide. Fits ""Indicator"" due to abstract discussion of suicide and framing suicidal feelings as unwanted/distressing (resolved via alternatives).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions hopelessness (""I can't go on anymore""), loneliness, despair over life circumstances (addiction, isolation from friends), and substance use (drunk).  
   - Explicit future intention: ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it.""  
   - ""End it"" strongly implies suicide (euphemism for self-inflicted death).  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring tools) described.  
   - Temporal marker (""tonight"") indicates imminence but no concrete action initiated yet.  
   - Desire to die is clear (""end it"") and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""end it"" (common suicide euphemism).  
   - Clear desire to die: ""I can't go on anymore"" + ""end it"" reflects intent, not abstract distress.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  
   → **Yes**, explicit intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method/means (e.g., pills, weapon, location tied to a plan).  
   - No preparations described (e.g., ""I have a rope,"" ""wrote a note"").  
   - ""Tonight"" implies timing but lacks actionable details.  
   → **No** plan/method/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""tonight I’m... gonna end it""), not a past or recent action.  
   - No initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  
   → Focus is on imminent future intent, not behavior/attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""failed everything,"" ""wasted [life],"" ""can't stand being here""), despair (""nobody understands,"" ""suffer everyday""), and an explicit struggle with suicidal urges (""resisting the desire to end""). Key phrases like ""desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" and ""can't imagine myself living another year"" indicate a personal desire to die. No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are mentioned. The emotional tone is one of active suffering and a stated inability to endure life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""can't stand being here,"" and ""can't imagine myself living another year"" explicitly convey a current personal desire to cease living. The writer does not negate this desire (e.g., no statements like ""but I don’t want to die"").

   - **No** mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines. The focus is on emotional anguish and a generalized desire to die.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes ongoing suffering (""everyday,"" ""since birth"") and current despair (""can't do this anymore"").  
   - **No** description of past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to the explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""desire to end"").  
   - **Behavior/Attempt** are ruled out due to the absence of plans, methods, preparations, or described actions.  
   - **Ideation** fits best: The author explicitly expresses a desire to die/not live (""desire to end,"" ""can't stand being here"") but provides no plan, method, or evidence of preparatory actions.

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness or inevitability (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), but no specific despair terms like ""hopeless"" are used.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on communication (""how do you tell the people you love"").
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the context is future-oriented (""eventually"").
   - Imminence is low due to ""eventually,"" which is vague and not immediate.
   - The writer expresses a personal belief about future suicide (""you will probably commit suicide"" implies ""I will...""), but it does not explicitly state whether this is an unwanted thought or a current desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide.""
   - Yes, it expresses a personal desire or belief about dying (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), which suggests acceptance or expectation, though not immediate intent.
   - The post does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). The focus is on communication, not negation of desire.
   - This leans away from 'Indicator' due to the explicit personal expression.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., writing a note, gathering means). Discussing how to tell loved ones is not a suicidal preparation; it is a communicative act.
   - Without any plan/method/preparation, this aligns with 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), not a past or recent event.
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of past attempts or actions taken).
   - Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), fitting 'Ideation'.
   - There is no ambiguity about suicidal desire being personal, so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The use of ""probably"" and ""eventually"" makes the intent less immediate but still constitutes suicidal ideation without concrete plans.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" (explicit suicidal ideation via external ""voices"").  
   - Expresses emotional distress: ""losing grip,"" ""can't cope,"" ""can't stop crying,"" hopelessness about financial mistakes.  
   - Explicitly states **unwanted** suicidal thoughts: ""I wanna see my daughters grow up"" directly negates the voices' command.  
   - No mention of a plan, method, preparation, or past/current suicidal actions. Focus is on internal conflict and distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""end myself"" is an explicit suicide reference.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post discusses leaving an abusive relationship and expresses hope for future emotional support and connection. 
    - Emotional indicators include distress (""i'm not okay right now"") but also resilience (""i can be okay""). 
    - The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" indirectly references suicidal thoughts but explicitly *rejects* them as unnecessary.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit statement: ""i dont wanna die rn"" negates current desire for death.  
   - Mentions suicidal thoughts as persistent (""always there"") but links them to boredom, not active intent.  
   - Asks about lethality of 3 Xanax pills but dismisses it as impossible (""i dont think thats possible"") and states the goal is to ""be calm,"" not self-harm.  
   - Warns against intervention (""dont tell me not to do this"") but clarifies this refers to taking Xanax for boredom relief, not suicide.  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or past action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn.""  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted/distressing intrusions (""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there""), not current desire.  
   - **Answer: No clear desire to die; thoughts are presented as passive/unwanted.**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Xanax mention is contextualized as a coping mechanism for boredom (""just wanna be calm""), not suicide means.  
   - No plan, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  
   - **Answer: No evidence of planning.**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts but no past/current suicidal actions.  
   - ""Will do it anyway"" refers to taking Xanax for boredom, not a suicide attempt.  
   - **Answer: No initiated lethal action.**  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress (boredom, intrusive thoughts) but actively rejects current desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but unwanted and detached from planning/action.  
   - Substance use is for coping, not self-harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Explicitly states ""kill myself"" in the context of a future action.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong guilt (""monster,"" ""human garbage""), hopelessness (""I don't know what to do""), and self-loathing.
   - Self-harm reference: Asks about locations for self-harm ""without anyone noticing.""
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific suicide method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned for the suicidal intent. The self-harm inquiry is distinct from the suicidal statement but indicates distress.
   - Past actions: None described; the suicidal intent (""I will wait until I can kill myself"") is future-oriented and conditional (""if he is dead"").
   - Desire: Explicitly expresses a desire to die under a specific condition (""if he is dead, I will wait until I can kill myself"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent. The conditional language (""if he is dead"") frames it as a genuine future desire, not an unwanted thought.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The self-harm question relates to non-lethal self-injury (seeking hidden locations), not suicide. The suicidal intent lacks concrete details (e.g., how, when, where).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The suicidal intent (""I will wait until I can kill myself"") is future-focused and conditional. No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The self-harm question implies potential future self-injury but not suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""kill myself""), placing it beyond *Indicator*.
   - While self-harm is mentioned, it is separate from the suicidal intent and does not constitute a plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The suicidal statement lacks specificity about means or timing.
   - No past or current suicidal actions (e.g., initiated attempts) are described, ruling out *Attempt*.
   - The explicit desire to die without a stated plan/method aligns with **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself soon,"" ""strong urge to [kill myself],"" ""wish I wasn't even born.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is fucking stupid""), perceived burden (""people don't care,"" ""don't make effort to keep me around"").
   - No mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).
   - Timeframe is implied (""soon"") but no immediate/imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire to die is explicitly stated (""kill myself,"" ""wish I wasn't born"") without negation or expression of unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: Directly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a genuine desire to die (""wish I wasn't born"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations mentioned. Urge and intent are clear, but no actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die qualifies as **Ideation**.
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of past/recent concrete action rules out **Attempt**.
   - Genuine wish to die (not abstract/unwanted thoughts) rules out **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions a specific suicidal method: ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground,"" which implies jumping as a means of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include temptation (""so tempted""), guilt, fear of consequences for others, and fear of survival (""crippled instead of a corpse""). This shows ambivalence but also a focus on suicide as a solution.
   - There is a specific method (jumping from a high floor) and a location (""highest floor"") implied, but no explicit preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools).
   - No references to past actions; the post is about current temptation and hypothetical scenarios.
   - Imminence is not indicated; words like ""tempted"" and ""if only"" suggest contemplation rather than immediate intent.
   - The writer expresses a temptation to act but with hesitation due to guilt and fear, indicating a desire for death (""corpse"") but not a firm commitment.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""plummet to the ground"" in this context is a clear euphemism for suicidal action.
   - It expresses a desire to die through the temptation (""so tempted"") and the outcome-focused language (""crippled instead of a corpse""), but this is tempered by ambivalence. The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are actively considered.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from a high floor (""plummet to the ground"" from ""the highest floor""). This constitutes a plan element.
   - No preparations are described (e.g., no note, no acquisition of means).
   - The presence of a method and location means this goes beyond mere desire and includes planning aspects.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current temptation for a potential future action, not a past event. There is no indication that any action has been initiated or attempted (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I went"").
   - It is purely contemplative, with no concrete, lethal actions taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - This is not 'Indicator' because the author expresses a personal temptation for suicide, not just general distress or abstract discussion. The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because, in addition to the desire (implied by ""tempted""), there is a specific method and location mentioned (jumping from a high floor), which elevates it to 'Behavior'.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described; the content is hypothetical and future-oriented.
   - The ambivalence (guilt, fear) does not negate the presence of a plan; it only indicates conflict. The explicit mention of a method confirms 'Behavior' per the definition.

Final reasoning: The post shows suicidal desire with a specific plan/method, so it fits 'Behavior'.

   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.

   - Imminence: Hypothetical/future-oriented (""if I deeply hurt""), not immediate.  
   - Desire to die is implied but framed conditionally; no explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""kill myself.""

   - No statement rejecting thoughts/desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No method/plan**: No tools, locations, substances, or steps described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions standing/sitting on the ledge of a hospital parking garage, explicitly referencing ""jump"" as a method.  
   - Expresses emotional distress (feeling unnoticed, hopelessness about gaining courage) and conflict about desire to die (""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"").  
   - Describes recurring **preparatory actions**: repeatedly going to the location, spending time on the ledge to ""work up the nerve.""  
   - Notes a past suicide at the same location but does not describe a personal past *action* by the author.  
   - States hope that someone will intervene, indicating ambivalence about acting.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Directly mentions ""jump"" in a suicidal context and acknowledges the possibility of dying (""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

   - Describes **repeated preparatory behavior** (going to the ledge, attempting to gain courage) but **no initiated lethal action** (e.g., they state they ""can never get the nerve to jump"").  
   - Past reference is about another person’s suicide, not the author’s own action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal intent are present (supports *Ideation* or higher).  
   - Specific method (jumping) and **repeated preparations** (visiting the ledge) confirm *Behavior*.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""tried committing suicide"" (past attempt using phone charger), ""death seems to [be] the ultimate answer,"" ""searching about ways to kill myself.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is going absolutely shitty""), despair (""everything I earned was just mooching""), anhedonia (""hated myself""), perceived burden (""all I caused was problems""), and exhaustion (""mentally exhausting"").
    - Specific methods/preparations: Past method (phone charger/rope), current research (""searching about ways to kill myself and find it to look like an accident"").
    - Past actions: Concrete past suicide attempt (""tried committing suicide"") and multiple other attempts (""I have multiple attempts on my life"").
    - Imminence: No explicit timeframe for future action, but current active research indicates ongoing preparation.
    - Desire: Expresses active desire to die (""my death seems [like] the ultimate answer"") and is researching methods. No statement of *not* wanting these thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - **Yes**: ""tried committing suicide,"" ""ways to kill myself,"" ""my death seems [like] the ultimate answer."" Clear desire to die is expressed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
    - **Yes**: Current active research into methods (""searching about ways to kill myself and find it to look like an accident""). This constitutes preparation, even if no single method is finalized.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
    - Past: Describes concrete past suicide attempts (using phone charger, ""multiple attempts"").
    - Present/Future: Expresses current suicidal desire and is actively researching methods (""recently began searching""). No description of a *recently initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I took pills last night""). The research is preparatory behavior, not an initiated lethal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - Explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator'.
    - The presence of current, active research into methods (""searching about ways to kill myself"") constitutes **preparation**, moving this into 'Behavior'. This is distinct from merely having thoughts (Ideation).
    - While past attempts are described ('Attempt' category), the rules state that 'Attempt' is for describing past/recent *initiated lethal actions*. The *current* risk is dominated by the active preparation (researching methods), which falls under 'Behavior'. The post does not describe a recent/current initiated lethal action; it describes preparatory steps and past attempts.
    - 'Behavior' is the correct category because the author explicitly mentions current preparation (researching suicide methods to disguise as an accident).

   - Specific method (""jump""), location (""bedroom window""), and environmental assessment (""trees and mud below"") indicate concrete planning. Preparation is evident in building courage. → **Yes**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes future intent (""can do it soon""). No mention of past/initiated action. → **Not an attempt**

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/location/preparation → **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated lethal action (only future intent) → Rules out ""Attempt"".  
   - Specificity of plan → Exceeds ""Ideation"".

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""depression hits really hard"" and ""next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'd just waste their time""), guilt/self-blame, isolation (""keep it to myself"").  
   - References to **past actions**: Writing suicide notes during depressive episodes.  
   - **No explicit current/future suicidal intent**, plan, method, or imminent timeline. Notes are described as a passive consequence (""next thing I know""), not an active current plan.  
   - Stated desire: Focuses on distress about family dynamics and therapy avoidance; **no expression of wanting to die**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Suicide notes are mentioned but framed as an unwanted byproduct of depression (""when depression hits""), **not a current desire to act**.  
   - Leans toward 'Indicator' due to lack of personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Writing suicide notes is a preparation, but it’s **referenced as a past/recurring action during depressive episodes**, not an active step toward imminent suicide.  
   - **No current plan, method (e.g., pills, location), or imminent preparation** described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Notes are written during past depressive episodes (""sometimes... I’m writing""), but **no concrete, initiated suicidal action** (e.g., ""I took pills"").  
   - Notes alone are preparatory but **not an attempt** (no action to end life).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Core issue: Distress about family, therapy, and depression.  
   - Suicide notes indicate **history of preparatory behavior** but are framed as **unwanted symptoms of depression**, not current intent.  
   - **No active desire to die, plan, or method** → Not 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.  
   - **No initiated lethal action** → Not 'Attempt'.  
   - Falls under '**Indicator**': Expresses depression and passive suicidal behaviors (notes) without current personal desire to die. Ambiguity about intent defaults to 'Indicator'.

204,"Hehe the world is funny. Me, suffering mentally while my father is asleep next to me is funny and so is the world. No one cares not even me if i get the things i sought and need its okay but if i dont i suddenly get all depressed there are people suffering from medical depression on this sub and you think your petty problems are enough to warrant sympathy from suicide watchers idk maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention. People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense despair and hopelessness (""No one cares not even me,"" ""i suddenly get all depressed,"" ""fuck me fuck da world""). It includes explicit mentions of death: ""hope i die"" and ""People dying is funny."" There is a personal expression of a desire to die (""hope i die""), but no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, substances, or actions like writing a note). The author references ""suicide watchers"" in a general context but not in relation to personal intent. The tone is nihilistic and self-deprecating, with the author suggesting their distress might be ""a ruse for attention,"" but this does not negate the expressed desire.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia (e.g., ""the world is funny"" in a sarcastic context, indicating loss of pleasure).
   - Plan/method/preparation: None identified. The post is expressive but lacks concrete details about how or when suicide might occur.
   - Past actions: No reference to any initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"" statements).
   - Imminence: No time frame (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") is mentioned.
   - Stated desire: ""hope i die"" indicates a genuine, personal wish to die, though it is not framed as unwanted; the ""attention"" comment adds ambiguity but does not explicitly state the thoughts are unwanted or not acted upon.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a clear desire to die through ""hope i die."" This is a personal statement of wanting not to be alive. The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die""); instead, the desire is presented as part of their distress. Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. The expressions are general and lack planning elements. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current emotions and thoughts, not past actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows an explicit personal desire to die (""hope i die""), which aligns with 'Ideation' (desire/thoughts without a plan or method). The ambiguity from the ""attention"" comment does not override the clear expression of suicidal desire, and there is no plan to shift it to 'Behavior'. Since there is no past action, 'Attempt' is not relevant. Rule: If doubt exists between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator', but here the desire is explicit and personal, so 'Ideation' is more appropriate.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key element is the phrase ""cut to deep,"" which likely means ""cut too deep,"" indicating a self-harm action involving cutting. There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or specific suicidal methods. Emotional indicators are limited to frustration (""fuck"") but no expressions of hopelessness, despair, or being a burden. The phrase ""just cut"" suggests a recent or past action, not a future plan or preparation. There is no stated desire to die or commit suicide; the focus is on the act itself.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). The post does not express a clear personal wish for death. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of unwanted thoughts or distress about them. This leans toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method (cutting) is mentioned, but it is not linked to suicidal intent. There is no indication that the cutting was part of a suicidal plan; it could be non-suicidal self-injury. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) or future plans are described. Without evidence of suicidal intent, this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past/recent action (""just cut""), but it is unclear if this action was intended to be lethal or was suicidal. The phrase ""cut too deep"" suggests possible accidental severity, but there is no description of it as a suicidal attempt (e.g., no context like ""I tried to die""). Without confirmation of suicidal intent, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post indicates self-harm distress but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or lethal action. It fits 'Indicator' as it shows general distress without explicit suicidal intent. There is ambiguity about suicidal desire, so per the rules, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. 'Attempt' is not applicable as no concrete, potentially lethal suicidal action is described.

They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses anger and frustration towards people who respond with generic advice like ""don't do it!"" or ""live for others."" 
   - Key elements include emotional distress (feeling misunderstood, involuntary negative feelings), criticism of others (""attention hungry piece of shit""), and a sense of being judged or exploited. 
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include frustration and resentment, but not explicit hopelessness, despair, or anhedonia. 
   - No references to plans, preparations, past actions, or imminence of suicidal intent. 
   - The author states, ""what I'm feeling is something I do by choice,"" implying involuntary distress, but does not specify suicidal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive. The focus is on criticizing others, not personal suicidal thoughts. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no statement about them being unwanted. 
   - Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator' due to lack of explicit suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, notes). 
   - Without any indication of planning, 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses others' actions (commenting) but does not describe any past or recent personal actions related to suicide or self-harm. 
   - No initiated lethal actions (e.g., no references to attempts), so 'Attempt' is not relevant.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and frustration about others' responses, but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. 
   - Ambiguity exists in ""what I'm feeling,"" but it is not explicit about suicidal thoughts. Per rules, if unsure between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator. 
   - Fits 'Indicator' definition: expresses distress and discusses reactions to potential suicidal contexts abstractly, but no clear, current personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""wanna die"" directly, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i struggle to get up,"" ""i find everything boring""), despair (""my friends are the only thing keeping me going and i dont have many since they all left""), and distress from bullying and school issues. There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The desire to die is expressed with ambivalence (""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time""), suggesting the thoughts are unwanted or conflicted. No temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"") is present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""wanna die,"" which indicates suicidal thoughts. However, the writer immediately qualifies this with ""but dont at the same time,"" explicitly stating that the desire is not wholehearted and may be unwanted. This ambivalence leans toward the thoughts being distressing but not representing a current, genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), plans, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on general feelings and thoughts, not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts only. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced. The only past event mentioned is stopping school attendance due to bullying, which is unrelated to suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""wanna die"" suggests suicidal ideation, but the explicit ambivalence (""but dont at the same time"") frames these thoughts as unwanted and not a clear personal desire to die. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress or unwanted suicidal thoughts without genuine intent. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. Given the ambiguity in desire, the rules specify to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and wanting to ""justify dying.""  
   - Expresses emotional distress: hopelessness (""every single day I feel terrible""), guilt, anxiety, depression, and fear of burdening others.  
   - References ""partially planning to die"" but provides **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - Notes impulsivity (""I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get"") but no concrete actions taken.  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts or initiated lethal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""planning to die."" The desire to die is personal and current, not negated as unwanted (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No specific plan/method**: While ""partially planning to die"" implies consideration, no details of means, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring pills, writing notes) are provided. The phrase ""I don’t have many strong and reliable methods"" confirms lack of access/plan specifics.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts** (""thinking about it most of the time for the past few months"") but **no past/current actions**. Mentions impulsivity as a future risk, but no initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation**: Clear personal desire to die (""want to justify dying"") and explicit suicidal thoughts, but no identifiable plan, method, or preparation. The phrase ""partially planning"" is vague and lacks actionable details, falling short of ""Behavior."" No past actions meet the threshold for ""Attempt.""  
   - **Not Behavior**: No method/preparation specified (rules: ""If unsure about plan/method, choose 'Ideation'"").  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire to die is explicit and personal, not abstract/unwanted.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""no reason to keep going,"" ""living was a total fucking scam""), feelings of worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid girl""), and isolation (job loss, no support system).  
   - Explicit suicidal desire: ""better off dead,"" ""too scared to end it,"" and ""now I really don't care anymore"" indicate a current desire to die.  
   - Plan/method: Specific method (""hang myself"") and location (""drive out into the mountains... find a nice little spot"") are mentioned.  
   - Preparation/timing: No explicit preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) or immediate timeline (""could just drive"" suggests future intent).  
   - Past actions: References past fear of acting but no description of initiated suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** Phrases like ""better off dead"" and the detailed plan to hang oneself confirm a personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes.** A specific method (hanging) and location (mountains, away from paths) are explicitly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes future intent (""I could just drive..."") but no past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

   - A specific plan/method is present (ruling out *Ideation*).  
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (ruling out *Attempt*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I am not healing""), anhedonia (""I don't enjoy anything""), and loneliness.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past/future actions are mentioned.  
   - The author mentions seeking therapy and antidepressants, but this does not negate the expressed desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly expresses a desire to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"").  
   - No statements suggest these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die qualifies for **'Ideation'**.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No described past/initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The distress is coupled with personal suicidal desire, so 'Indicator' is too low.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions being ""unbelievably suicidal"" and experiencing ""suicidal thoughts"" daily for years.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""it's been years,"" ""no hope""), exhaustion (""tired of all of it""), and frustration with ineffective coping strategies.

   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a specific suicide method (using eye drops) inspired by a crime video.
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""i wish i wasn't like this"") and active suppression of suicidal thoughts.
   - The writer explicitly states they ""don't want to have to do that"" (act on suicidal thoughts), framing the thoughts as unwanted.
   - No plan, preparation, or imminent timeline is indicated (e.g., acquiring eye drops, setting a date).
   - No past/current suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned, but the writer explicitly negates the desire to act (""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that""). The primary sentiment is distress about intrusive thoughts, not a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (eye drops) is referenced as an ""idea,"" but it is contextualized as an unwanted intrusive thought stemming from media exposure. There is no indication of planning, preparation, or intent to use this method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The content focuses solely on thoughts and internal conflict.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post expresses distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts and a specific method, explicitly stating no desire to act. This aligns with **Indicator** (unwanted thoughts without personal intent).

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions writing a suicide note, planning a time/place for suicide, and preparing to post it on social media.  
   - Emotional indicators include despair (""I’m the common denominator in all my problems"") and a desire for the ""calm"" associated with the suicide plan.  
   - Specific preparations: wrote a note, picked a time/place, primed it for posting.  
   - Past action: The user ""sabotaged"" the plan (blocked themselves), so no lethal action occurred.  
   - Current intent: Expresses a desire to recapture the feeling and states, ""maybe I’ll actually be able to do it this time,"" indicating ongoing suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. References a suicide note and states a desire to ""free myself of my problems"" (euphemism for suicide) and ""do it this time."" The desire to die is personal and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific preparations: note written, time/place chosen, note primed for posting. The phrase ""Planned everything out"" confirms concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past: Describes preparations (note, plan) but self-sabotaged—**no initiated lethal action**.  
   - Present/Future: Expresses active desire to reignite the plan (""coax the feeling back"") and potential future action (""maybe I’ll actually be able to do it this time"").  
   - No description of a past *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ingestion, jumping), so it does not qualify as an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and detailed suicide preparations are present.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific plan/preparations (note, time/place) move this beyond mere thoughts.  
   - **Not Attempt**: The past event involved planning/preparation but no initiated lethal action (sabotaged before acting).  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + explicit plan/preparations (note, time/place) + intent to re-engage. Current language (""maybe I’ll actually be able to do it this time"") signals ongoing risk.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""I don't feel it will ever end""), despair (""I feel like utter hell""), isolation (""I feel so alone and forgotten""), worthlessness (""I am just a stain upon the world""), and trauma (abusive household, PTSD, anxiety).  
   - Mentions passive thoughts about disappearance (""the world would not change at all if I were gone"") but **explicitly negates active suicidal intent** by stating: ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present.""  
   - No references to suicide, self-harm, death, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Phrases like ""if I were gone"" are abstract, not literal.  
   - Emotional focus: Pain is central, but the writer clings to reasons to stay alive (finding worth, therapy, faith).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or direct desire to die.  
   - Passive wishes (e.g., ""I wish I wasn't alone"") reflect loneliness, not death-seeking. The closest phrase (""if I were gone"") is hypothetical and countered by active commitment to stay.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not present**; distress about existence is framed as unwanted suffering, not a desire to end life.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No tools, locations, substances, plans, notes, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past trauma and ongoing emotional pain but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: The post shows severe distress, worthlessness, and passive hopelessness but lacks any personal expression of *desire to die*, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or action. The statement affirming the choice to ""stay"" and ""find worth"" directly opposes suicidal intent. Vague references to disappearance (""if I were gone"") are abstract and contextualized within existential pain, not a current wish to act.  
   - *Not Ideation*: No explicit desire to die or suicidal thoughts.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plans, methods, preparations, or actions.

216,"I'm an abuser harassed narccister master. And all those word just make me want to die. So Tuesday, I'm either going to slit my wrist and get into my broken car or hang myself from a tree for my parents to see. I'm done with life all I cause is pain. I can tell you who to ask and they'll assure you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses a desire to die (""all those word just make me want to die"") and hopelessness (""I'm done with life""). It explicitly mentions specific suicidal methods: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself from a tree,"" including details like using a ""broken car"" and targeting a location (""for my parents to see""). There is a specific timeline (""Tuesday"") indicating imminence. The emotional context includes despair and self-perception as a burden (""all I cause is pain""). No past actions are described; the focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""want to die"" and describes personal suicidal intentions (""I'm either going to slit my wrist... or hang myself""), confirming a genuine desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned (""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself"") with implied tools/means (e.g., ""broken car,"" ""tree"") and a timeline (""Tuesday""). This shows clear planning and preparation, aligning with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""Tuesday, I'm either going to..."") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed). Thus, it is not an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire and specific methods/plans rules out 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire or explicit intent) and 'Ideation' (which lacks plans/methods). The future-oriented context without initiated action distinguishes it from 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a plan, method, and preparation.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and repeatedly expresses a desire for death (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness about life's purpose (""Why do I struggle... if it won't lead to anything?""), anhedonia (emptiness after temporary joys), and guilt over perceived selfishness of suicide.  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - The author references **past events** (robbery incident) but **no past suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or preparations).  
   - The desire to die is explicit but conflicted due to obligations (dog, friends, parents), though these are deterrents, not negations of the desire itself.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and a personal wish for death (e.g., ""better if I was dead"").  
   - The author does **not** explicitly reject the thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don’t want these thoughts""). Instead, they rationalize not acting due to guilt, keeping the desire intact.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No method** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **preparation** (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned.  
   - Abstract references to death (""eternal sleep"") lack concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current ideation** but **no past/current suicidal actions**. The robbery anecdote illustrates calmness toward death but is unrelated to self-initiated harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + suicidal thoughts → **Rules out 'Indicator'**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → **Rules out 'Behavior'**.  
   - No described past/recent suicidal actions → **Rules out 'Attempt'**.  
   - Core elements align with **Ideation**: personal desire to die, explicit suicidal thoughts, but absence of plan or action.  
   - The conflict (guilt over consequences) does not negate the active desire, fitting 'Ideation' definition.

It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow.

   - **No explicit current desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - Mentions feeling ""more suicidal"" as a *past consequence* of hospitalization but frames it retrospectively.

   - No current/future intentions or actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is distress about systemic trauma and a request for safe resources.  
   - Mentions ""suicidal"" only as a *past outcome* of a negative experience, not as a current personal desire or thought.  
   - Lacks explicit desire to die, plans, methods, or descriptions of concrete actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense anger and frustration about being labeled as ""attention-seeking"" when expressing feelings or seeking help. 
    - Key emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""They won't believe it until I die""), feeling neglected (""I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT""), and despair.
    - Mentions past help-seeking being dismissed but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**. 
    - The phrase ""ended it silently"" is quoted from others' statements (not the author's personal intent). The author rebuts this by emphasizing their struggle to ""hold on"" and need for help.
    - No temporal markers suggest imminent risk (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - **No**. The author does not state a personal desire to die, commit suicide, or be dead. They explicitly frame their actions as attempts to ""hold on"" and ""need help,"" rejecting the narrative of silent suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
    - **None**. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is on emotional distress and invalidation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
    - Describes **past experiences** of seeking help and being neglected. 
    - **No description** of any initiated suicidal actions (past or recent). References to ""until I die"" are hypothetical/frustrated rhetoric, not a report of concrete actions.

    - Lacks explicit personal desire to die (""I want to die""), specific plans, or descriptions of suicidal actions.  
    - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses hopelessness and distress about unmet needs, with suicidal themes only appearing as rejected external accusations (not personal intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Expressions of distress (""holding it all in,"" ""about to explode,"" ""I'm not ok""), hopelessness (""I don't know what to do anymore""), explicit suicidal intent (""i'm going to kms,"" ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon""), self-harm (""I can't stop cutting""), and barriers to seeking help.  
   - **Explicit suicide/death intent**: Yes (""kill myself,"" ""kms,"" ""I'm going to kill myself very soon""). The desire is personal, current, and not negated (e.g., no statement of *not* wanting to act).  
   - **Plan/method/preparation**: Mentions self-harm (""cutting"") but no specific suicide method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no pills, note, or timeline beyond ""very soon""). ""Kms"" is vague slang without method details.

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation described (e.g., ""cutting"" is self-harm, not a stated suicide method). ""Soon"" is non-specific, and ""kms"" lacks method details. Thus, **Ideation** is appropriate.

So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care.

   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""OD"" (overdose) as a method, lists specific medications (venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolpidem, inderal), and expresses a desire to take them all at once. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't feel anything right now"") and anhedonia. There is a specific plan implied for ""today,"" with preparations indicated by having access to the medications. References to past suicidal thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while"") are present, but no description of past actions or attempts. Imminence is clear with ""today."" The writer expresses a current desire to act (""I feel like popping all of them"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and phrases like ""going to OD"" indicate a direct desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the writer focuses on the urge to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (overdose) and means (listed medications) are mentioned. Having a ""month's prescription"" implies access and preparation, as the writer possesses the tools for the act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""going to OD today"") and past suicidal ideation, but no initiated action (e.g., no mention of having taken pills or being interrupted). The focus is on planning and current thoughts, not a completed or interrupted act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan/method (overdose with named medications) rules out 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. The lack of any described initiated action (e.g., no past attempt) rules out 'Attempt'. This fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent, stated plan, and preparation (access to means).

225,"Sorry. I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up. Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. The end is the only thing that feels right now. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up""), despair, and a sense of finality.
   - It includes apologies and thank-yous (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life""), which may indicate farewell sentiments.
   - The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies a personal desire for death or suicide, framed as something that feels necessary or correct.
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), or past actions (e.g., previous attempts). The goodbyes are emotional but not explicit preparations.
   - The temporal context is current/future-oriented (""feels right now""), with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or past initiated actions.
   - The writer's desire appears genuine, with no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""the end"" is a clear euphemism for death or suicide in this context.
   - It expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""The end is the only thing that feels right now""), with no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").
   - Thus, suicidal intent is present and personal, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan (e.g., ""going to jump""), or explicit preparation (e.g., ""I have the pills"") is mentioned.
   - The apologies and goodbyes could be interpreted as preparatory in a general sense, but they are not concrete or explicit enough to qualify as planning for suicide (e.g., not stated as part of a suicide plan).
   - Without any clear plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intention (""feels right now""), not on past or recent actions.
   - There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried""), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""The end is the only thing that feels right now""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear suicidal desire).
   - However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it involves a current personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die without a plan or method.

Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions emotional distress (""feel so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" ""overwhelmed"").
   - Explicitly references prior suicidal and depressed state.
   - Expresses a specific method: ""cutting my god damn throat"" to ""shut every thought down.""
   - Indicates current desire to act: ""all I want to do.""
   - No mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or past actions.
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: ""cutting my god damn throat"" implies lethal self-harm with clear intent to end suffering/die. The phrase ""all I want to do"" confirms current desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: A specific method (""cutting my throat"") is explicitly stated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a *current urge* (""all I want to do"") but **no past or recent initiated action** (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""did"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die via self-harm is present.
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: A specific method (""cutting my throat"") is mentioned.
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of a past/initiated action.
   - **'Behavior'**: Suicidal desire + specific method mentioned, with no indication of preparation or action.

227,"Quote about suicide. I recently stumbled upon this quote that said something along the lines of ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doenst matter"" much more beautifully phrased thought. Anyone know more about it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post references a quote about suicide (""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going"") but frames it as something the author ""stumbled upon"" and is seeking more information about. There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, hopelessness, despair, or self-harm. The author does not describe any plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The core of the post is a neutral inquiry about the origin of a philosophical quote.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""kill yourself"" appears, but it is explicitly attributed to a quote, not expressed as the author's personal desire.  
   - The author does not state any personal wish to die, be gone, or end their life.  
   - The post lacks any indication of the author experiencing unwanted suicidal thoughts; instead, it focuses on external curiosity about the quote.  
   → **No explicit personal suicidal intent**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - The quote is discussed abstractly, with no connection to the author's actions or plans.  
   → **No plan or preparation indicators**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes discovering a quote, not a past or recent suicidal action.  
   - No initiated self-harm or suicide attempt is referenced.  
   → **No evidence of concrete action**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly (via a quote) but shows **no personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, or past attempt** by the author.  
   - The author’s tone is inquisitive (""Anyone know more about it?"") and detached, framing the quote as an external concept.  
   - This aligns with **Indicator**: general discussion of suicide without personal expression of intent, desire, or distress.  
   - Ambiguity about suicidal desire is absent; the lack of personal connection to the quote’s content rules out Ideation/Behavior/Attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""wanting to die"" and being ""ready to join my dog"" (implying a desire for death to reunite with a deceased pet). It expresses strong hopelessness (""my life will never get better""), despair (""i'm not happy anymore""), and anhedonia (""i've never been truly happy""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). The phrase ""ready to join my dog"" indicates a current desire to die but lacks concrete plans or actions. No past suicidal actions are described—only recurring thoughts (""i always end up wanting to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through ""wanting to die"" and ""ready to join my dog."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to feel this way""). Instead, the author has ""accepted"" their fate, confirming a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or means (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned. The phrase ""join my dog"" is vague and metaphorical, not implying a concrete plan. No preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing feelings and a current state of readiness (""now i'm ready""), but no past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned. References to ""wanting to die"" are about recurring thoughts, not initiated behaviors (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog"") rules out 'Indicator,' which requires no personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires suicidal desire plus planning elements).
   - No description of past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., an attempt) excludes 'Attempt.'
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a clear, personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but without specific plans, methods, or actions.

229,"My grandpa passed away tonight. I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit. Now, I know I can't do that. My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal intent: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas.""  
   - Emotional context: Grandfather's death prevented action due to concern for mother (""I couldn't add the loss of a child"").  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline beyond ""before Christmas.""  
   - Explicitly negates current intent: ""Now, I know I can’t do that"" and ""his passing has saved my life.""  
   - Focuses on newfound perspective and avoidance of causing pain, not active desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit past desire: ""kill myself"" confirms suicidal intent.  
   - **But** the desire is explicitly negated as unwanted *now*: ""I know I can’t do that"" and ""saved my life.""  
   - Current framing emphasizes distress about consequences (hurting mother), not a present wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations described.  
   - ""Before Christmas"" is a timeframe, not a specific plan.  
   - Lacks actionable details required for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **past ideation only** (""was going to,"" ""had previously made up my mind"").  
   - No mention of any initiated action (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Current state rejects acting on past thoughts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit past suicidal thoughts meet 'Ideation' criteria.  
   - **However**, the core message rejects desire to act *due to distress about consequences*. The writer explicitly states they *do not want* to follow through (""can’t do that""), framing suicidal thoughts as unwanted.  
   - Rules clarify: If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly unwanted/not representing current desire, use 'Indicator'.  
   - No plan/method/preparation (rules: if unsure between Indicator/Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator).  
   - Conclusion: Falls under 'Indicator' (distress about past thoughts, no current desire/plan).

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide for days"" (February timeframe), current suicidal ideation triggered by family conflicts (""when we fight I always think about suicide""), and explicit research into methods (""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I feel like I'm faking it""), anger/despair about family dynamics, and guilt over perceived attention-seeking.  
   - No specific plan, method, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills/rope/bridge mentioned; no note-writing or means acquisition). Research into methods is noted but lacks specificity or immediacy.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Desire to die is explicitly stated (""want to commit suicide"") but framed as triggered by specific events and questioned by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide,"" and ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Genuine desire is expressed (""want to commit suicide""), though the author questions their motives. No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Mentions ""research[ing] easy painless ways"" but no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described. Research alone, without actionable details, is insufficient for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Thoughts occurred in the past (February) and currently (""always think about suicide"" during fights).  
   - **No initiated action**: Describes thoughts/research only. No mention of past/current concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""want to commit suicide"") and personal suicidal thoughts → Rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out 'Behavior'. Research into methods is passive, not preparatory.  
   - **No description of past/current initiated lethal action** → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits **'Ideation'**: Explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts, absent specific plans/methods/preparations.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""life is useless,"" indicating hopelessness or despair. It discusses ""something better on the other side"" (referring to a state without thought, emotions, or physical form) and explicitly states ""Death and suicide need to be normalized,"" showing an abstract or philosophical discussion of death and suicide.
   - No specific mentions of personal suicidal intent, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
   - The author's stated desire: The post expresses distress about life (""life is useless"") and advocates for normalizing suicide, but it does not explicitly convey a personal, current desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts. The tone is more conceptual than personal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""), but it is discussed abstractly as a societal issue, not as a personal expression of intent (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"").
   - The author does not state a clear personal desire to die; instead, the focus is on the idea of an afterlife and normalizing suicide.
   - There is no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or negated by the author, but the lack of personal desire expression leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - Without any plan or method, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no references to attempts, even if interrupted or failed).
   - The content is general and philosophical, not tied to a specific timeframe or action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (""life is useless"") and abstract discussion of suicide/death, but it lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author. Phrases like ""something better on the other side"" are speculative and not explicitly tied to the author's own wishes.
   - There is ambiguity regarding genuine suicidal desire, but per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', 'Indicator' should be chosen.
   - No elements of plan/method ('Behavior') or past actions ('Attempt') are present.
   - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category, as the post focuses on distress and normalization of suicide without personal suicidal intent.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post romanticizes death as a release from pain and life's burdens (""never feel pain,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""let go after holding on so tight""). It describes death abstractly as ""beautiful"" and uses metaphorical language (""black sea of infinity""). There are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions. The focus is on the *concept* of death as peaceful/desirable, not a personal intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: The post discusses the ""thought of death"" philosophically but does **not** express a clear, personal desire for the author to die or commit suicide (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). The language is impersonal and reflective, framing death as an abstract idea rather than a personal intention. **No explicit desire is expressed.**

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: No specific suicide plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content remains entirely conceptual.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post discusses a *thought* (""Ain't the thought..."") with no reference to past, current, or future actions. No initiated behaviors or attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post expresses distress/hopelessness and frames death positively but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. It falls under 'Indicator' due to the abstract, impersonal nature of the statements and absence of explicit suicidal intent from the author. The language leans toward existential distress rather than active ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""i never fucking knew where""), despair (""i'm so fucking tired""), feeling like a burden (""my friends basically don't fucking care about me""), and isolation (""there's literally no one i can go to"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: The author states, ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" They also declare a loss of fear of death.  
   - **Plan/Method**: The suicidal action is conditional on a COVID-positive result. A method is vaguely referenced (""use any method""), but no specific tools, substances, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context**: The plan is future-oriented (""tomorrow""), with no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""i'll kill myself"" and ""i'll use any method... as long as i don't see another day."" The desire to die is unequivocal and personal.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation**. While the suicide decision is tied to a COVID result, the method is nonspecific (""any method""). There is no mention of gathering tools, selecting a location, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""tomorrow""). No past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, ruling out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The author expresses a desire to die and a conditional intent to act but lacks a specific plan/method/preparation. The vague reference to ""any method"" is insufficient for 'Behavior' (per rules: ""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation'"").  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post meets 'Ideation' criteria (explicit desire to die, conditional intent, no actionable plan/method).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef"" (typo for ""kill myself""), indicating explicit suicidal intent. It describes a specific action: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (zopiclone overdose), which is a method for suicide. The phrase ""and nothing"" implies the action failed. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Failrure,"" ""can't kill myself properly""), feeling like a burden (""stop being a burden and a disappoinment""), and isolation (""i have nobody else""). The writer also expresses a current desire to die with ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" and a plea for help (""Pleasw help""), suggesting ambivalence but not negating the suicidal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. The plea for help does not explicitly state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, it reinforces distress without negating the intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (a sedative), indicating a concrete action. This is not just a plan; it is a described past action involving preparation and means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing,"" which is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that failed. This qualifies as an attempt under the definition (initiated but failed). The current statement ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" indicates ongoing ideation, but the past attempt takes precedence for classification.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) or mere desire to die (Ideation) because it describes a concrete, past suicidal action. It also includes planning elements (method: zopiclone overdose), but the key is the initiated action, which fits 'Attempt'. The Attempt category includes failed or interrupted actions, like this one. Even with current ideation, the past attempt is the dominant factor.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes feelings of social isolation, discrimination (""treated as a lesser human""), frustration with learning disabilities, and anger towards neurotypical individuals (""NTs""). It ends with an explicit suicidal statement: ""I might kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair (""navigate through Hell every fucking day""), hopelessness (""I feel like I don't belong in society""), and anger are present.
   - Suicide-specific content: Direct mention of ""kill myself"" indicates suicidal thoughts, but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, means) are discussed.
   - Past actions: No references to past suicidal actions, attempts, or preparations. The focus is on historical bullying and current emotional state.
   - Imminence: The phrase ""I might"" suggests possibility but no immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - Desire: The suicidal thought is expressed as a potential outcome (""might"") without explicit negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""), indicating distress with an underlying desire to escape suffering.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a personal desire to not be alive in the context of despair (e.g., ""I feel like I don't belong in society"" leading to ""I might kill myself"").
   - No, there is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, it leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks detail.
   - No signs of planning or preparation (e.g., no notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means). Without these, it cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past experiences (bullying, school) and current emotions, but the suicidal statement (""I might kill myself"") is future-oriented and vague, with no indication of timing.
   - No description of any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). Thus, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""I might kill myself"") with a personal desire to die, but no plan/method/preparation, aligns with 'Ideation'.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal suicidal intent, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent suicidal action is described.
   - The uncertainty in ""might"" does not override the explicit suicidal expression; per guidelines, phrases like ""I'm going to end it all"" are considered 'Ideation' when no plan is present.

236,Goodbye. I've been struggling with depression for god knows how long and I'm going to end it tonight by taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil. Goodbye world. I will be non existent in about a few minutes.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""I'm going to end it tonight"" and ""I will be non existent,"" indicating a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include struggling with depression and a sense of finality with ""Goodbye world.""
   - Specific methods are clearly stated: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil,"" which refers to a planned overdose.
   - There are no references to past actions; the post describes an imminent future intention with temporal cues like ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes.""
   - The writer's desire is unambiguously to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""end it"" and ""non existent"" in a context of despair, confirming a clear, personal desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (overdosing on Tylenol and Advil) is mentioned, along with a timeline (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes""). This constitutes a plan, leaning toward 'Behavior'. No explicit preparations (e.g., note-writing) are described, but the method detail suffices for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going to end it"") with high imminence. There is no description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no mention of having taken pills or being interrupted). Thus, this is not an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method/plan align with 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' due to clear suicidal intent, not 'Ideation' because a method is specified, and not 'Attempt' as no action has been initiated. The presence of a plan/method places it firmly in 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct desire for suicide.  
   - Emotional distress is evident (e.g., ""physically uncomfortable,"" ""really miserable,"" frustration about memory gaps).  
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - No past actions or attempts are described—only distress over forgotten memories and current misery.  
   - The phrase ""want to kill myself"" reflects a current personal desire to die without negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The post uses the direct phrase ""I want to kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: It expresses a clear desire to die (""want to kill myself"").  
   - **No**: The writer does not state these thoughts are unwanted or express resistance to acting on them.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a desire to die but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no reference to initiating self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No—the explicit personal desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules this out.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes—there is a clear expression of suicidal desire (""want to kill myself"") but **no plan, method, or preparation**.  
   - **Behavior?** No—lack of any plan/method/preparation details.  
   - **Attempt?** No—no description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **Final Decision**: The explicit desire to die without a plan/method aligns with **Ideation**.

My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday. I promised myself this after my first failed attempt in October. This was until my friends convinced me to have a little party. Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times (""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" ""die"") and references a past ""failed attempt in October."" It expresses strong emotional despair (""life wants me to kill myself,"" ""everything is shit,"" ""I deserve to die and suffer""), hopelessness (""I'm not deserving of love""), and a specific future plan to act on suicidal thoughts (""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks""). The writer also states a genuine desire to die, with no indication of resistance or unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""end myself,"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I deserve to die,"" ""I will end myself""). There is no mention of these thoughts being unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - For the current/future intention, a specific timeline is mentioned (""on my birthday in two weeks""), but no method (e.g., tools, substances) or explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed. This leans toward 'Ideation' for the current risk, as the plan is temporal but not methodological. However, the past ""failed attempt"" is referenced, which involves concrete action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes both a past event (""my first failed attempt in October"") and a future intention (""I will end myself... in two weeks""). The past event is a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that failed, which meets the 'Attempt' criteria. The future plan indicates ideation but no initiated action yet.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes explicit suicidal desire and future plans, but the key factor is the clear description of a past suicide attempt. According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past, potentially lethal action is mentioned, even alongside current ideation. The past attempt was concrete (initiated and failed), so it outweighs the current 'Ideation' or 'Behavior' elements. Since no specific method or preparation is mentioned for the current plan, and the past action is definitive, 'Attempt' is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions a past suicide attempt: ""one month from my last suicide attempt"".
   - States current absence of suicidal thoughts: ""My suicidal thoughts kinda left... they are gone"".
   - Notes thinking about death passively but not acting: ""I think about death but not about doing it!"".
   - Expresses improved mental state and gratitude for survival.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicitly references a personal past suicide attempt (""last suicide attempt"").
   - **No current desire to die** expressed (emphasizes thoughts are gone).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No current plan/method/preparation** described.
   - Past attempt implies prior behavior, but the focus is on the completed past action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Clearly describes a **past self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: ""my last suicide attempt"".
   - No current plans or imminent risk indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post centers on a **concrete past suicide attempt** (""Attempt"" definition: *""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... potentially lethal""*).
   - Current mental state (absent ideation) doesn’t override the classification of the described past action.
   - Rules state: *""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'""*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""can't sleep,"" loss of interest (""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy""), guilt, exhaustion.  
   - Explicitly states: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""  
   - References ""awful thoughts"" causing fear but emphasizes no plan.  
   - No explicit desire to die, suicide/death terms, methods, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts (""awful thoughts"") are explicitly framed as distressing and feared, not desired.  
   - **Leans toward 'Indicator'** due to lack of personal desire to die and explicit negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicitly denies having a plan: ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself.""  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and thoughts but no past/current concrete actions.  
   - No initiated suicidal acts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts without a personal desire to act.  
   - Denial of plan/method rules out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.  
   - Lack of explicit desire to die and focus on fear of thoughts aligns with **'Indicator'** (distress about thoughts ≠ active ideation).

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains expressions of deep despair, hopelessness, and self-loathing (e.g., ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I fucking hate myself,"" ""I want to die"").  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present: ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""  
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned.  
   - The author mentions avoiding suicide due to family impact (""your parents will be sad dummy"") but maintains a persistent desire to die.  
   - Self-harm fantasies (""amputating parts of my body, burning myself"") are described as intrusive thoughts, but the author denies acting on them (""I've never purposely hurt myself"").  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; hospitalization references are historical and not tied to a concrete attempt.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I want to die"" and persistent thoughts of dying indicate a current personal desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., overdose, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. Self-harm imagery remains hypothetical/internal.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing suicidal ideation (""every fucking day"") but no past/recent initiated lethal actions. Avoidance due to family concern implies contemplation without action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit, personal desire to die (""I want to die"") and lack of negation push this beyond general distress (Indicator) into **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes intense emotional and physical pain (""hurting,"" ""hurt so bad emotionally that it starts to hurt physically,"" ""muscles ache,"" ""everything is so exhausting""), depression (""i'm so depressed""), and a sense of hopelessness or giving up (""my own body is giving up""). It explicitly expresses a desire for death (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight""). There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., notes), or past actions related to suicide. The temporal context is immediate (""tonight""), but the desire is passive (hoping for death in sleep, not self-inflicted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No). However, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die""), which aligns with a wish not to be alive. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). The passive nature (hoping for death in sleep) does not change the explicit desire for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The reference to dying in sleep is a hope for a passive event, not an active plan or method by the author. Therefore, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a future-oriented hope (""tonight""), but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions are mentioned. The content is about feelings and wishes, not concrete behaviors or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""hoping i will die"") indicates suicidal ideation, falling under 'Ideation' as defined. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past or recent initiated suicidal action is present, ruling out 'Attempt'. While the post includes general distress, the clear expression of a desire to die distinguishes it from 'Indicator', which lacks such personal intent. The ambiguity rule (choosing 'Indicator' if uncertain about genuine desire) does not apply here, as the desire is explicit and personal.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions an overdose of Zoloft (a specific method: ""took 6 pills...300mg"") and describes a concrete action taken by the author (""at 11:30 I took 6 pills""). 
   - Emotional indicators include distress about the outcome (""wasn't enough to kill me"") and physical symptoms (nausea, sweating), but the core focus is on a completed act. 
   - There is no explicit statement of ongoing desire to die; instead, the author describes a past action and questions the consequences (""will I be okay?""). 
   - The temporal context is clear: the overdose occurred at a specific past time (""11:30""). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""overdose"" implies intent to die, and the phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms the action was taken with lethal intent. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - A specific method (overdosing on Zoloft pills) is explicitly described. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""took 6 pills""). Even though the outcome was non-fatal, the author initiated a concrete suicidal act. This meets the definition of an attempt. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The overdose is a specific, initiated action (not just thoughts or plans). 
   - The post focuses on the aftermath of this action (symptoms, concern about safety), but the core event is a completed attempt. 
   - ""Behavior"" would apply if the author described *plans* for an overdose, but here the action has already occurred.  
   - **Attempt** takes precedence because a concrete, potentially lethal act was initiated by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""destined to do it"" (implying a fate or intention to commit suicide), ""I've made my decision"" (indicating a resolved intent), ""not living in a body that has clearly given up"" (expressing a desire to die), and ""hope my plan works though"" (suggesting a suicide plan exists). Emotional indicators include chronic stress, trauma, loss of health, severe chronic fatigue, and feelings of calmness/peace about the decision (""I feel so calm about it. At peace knowing it's soon""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., prior attempts). The imminence is hinted at with ""soon,"" but no specific timeframe is given. The desire to die is clear and not portrayed as unwanted or distressing; instead, it is accepted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a desire to die through phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""not living,"" and ""I've made my decision."" The context shows a genuine wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Therefore, explicit intent is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The phrase ""hope my plan works though"" references a suicide plan, but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described. The plan is vague and lacks detail. Per the rules, if unsure about explicitness, 'Ideation' should be chosen over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""it's soon,"" ""destined to do it,"" ""hope my plan works"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interruptions, or failures). This is prospective, not retrospective.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a clear desire to die (suicidal ideation) but lacks an explicit plan, method, or preparation. The mention of a ""plan"" is insufficiently detailed to qualify as 'Behavior' (per the rule: if unsure, choose 'Ideation'). There is no described action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the explicit personal desire to die. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""Hopeless,"" ""I've felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"") and self-blame (""it's me"").  
   - The author rejects support (""I don't want encouragement... it will get better"").  
   - The key actionable phrase is: **""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""** This indicates an interest in suicide-related content but does **not** express a personal desire to die, a plan, or a method.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit desire to die**: Phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself"" are absent. The focus is on hopelessness and seeking a forum, not a personal wish to act.  
   - **Unwanted thoughts not stated**: The interest in a suicide forum suggests curiosity or distress but lacks a direct link to the author’s own suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No plan/method mentioned**: There is no reference to tools, locations, timelines, or preparations (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""going to jump""). Seeking a forum implies exploration, not planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past or imminent action**: The post describes ongoing emotional distress (""months"") but no concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried last night"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress and hopelessness**, with tangential engagement (seeking a suicide forum) that lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.  
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** because:  
     - Suicidal thoughts are **not personally claimed** (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent).  
     - The forum reference is abstract/distressed curiosity, not a plan.  
     - Ambiguity about genuine desire to die defaults to 'Indicator' per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions suicidal method: ""slash my wrists and die.""  
   - Expresses intense despair (""I'm disgusting,"" ""how low my expectations,"" ""idc just want an end"").  
   - Explicit desire to die (""want an end""), with acknowledgment of pain but no reluctance to act.  
   - No reference to past suicide attempts or preparations (e.g., no note, tool acquisition).  
   - Temporal context: ""on the verge of trying"" indicates imminent intent but not yet initiated action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end"" show a clear, personal desire to die.

I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""life is not able to be fixed,"" ""bullshit phase"") and a desire to escape pain through death (""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone"").  
   - Explicitly mentions death/dying (""I cannot wait to die"") and references practical preparations (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.  
   - The funeral cost preparation indicates forward planning related to death but does not describe a *concrete suicidal act* (e.g., acquiring means for suicide).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The phrase ""I cannot wait to die"" expresses a clear, personal desire to die to end pain. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") to suggest these thoughts are unwanted or passive.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes** for preparation. Fixing funeral costs is a tangible action tied to anticipated death, indicating preparation (similar to ""writing a note"" in intent).  
   - **No** for specific method/plan (e.g., tools, location, or immediate steps to enact suicide).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future-oriented desire (""cannot wait to die"") and preparation (funeral plans).  
   - **No** mention of past/recent *initiated actions* (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - Funeral cost preparation elevates it beyond mere thoughts (Ideation) to actionable planning (Behavior), per the definition: ""preparations being taken.""  
   - No concrete, past/ongoing suicidal act (e.g., ingesting pills) → not 'Attempt'.  
   - **Conclusion**: 'Behavior' is appropriate due to stated desire to die **plus** explicit preparations (funeral arrangements).

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions: ""destined to live a depressed life,"" ""can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful,"" ""what's really the point?"".
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness, despair about the future, loss of past happiness, self-described ""depressed life.""
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**  
   - **No mention of past actions related to suicide.**  
   - Focuses on existential despair and perceived irreversible loss of happiness, not a desire to end life.  
   - Writer explicitly seeks ""wisdom"" and acknowledges potential self-indulgence, suggesting a desire for perspective/support, not intent to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - **No clear desire to die** expressed (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I don’t want to be alive"").  
   - Focuses on hopelessness about *quality of life*, not ending life.  
   → Leans strongly toward **Indicator**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No mention** of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  
   → **Not applicable**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Discusses past happiness and anticipated future suffering.  
   - **No description** of past or imminent suicidal actions.  
   → **Not applicable**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Expresses severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent**.  
   - Philosophical questioning (""what’s the point?"") reflects existential despair, not active suicidal ideation.  
   - Seeks external input (""does anybody have wisdom""), indicating distress about their state, not intent.  
   - **No ambiguity requiring default to 'Indicator'**: Clear absence of suicidal desire/plan/action.  
   → **Fits 'Indicator' definition**: Distress about life’s meaning and future depression without suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""jump from a bridge"" as a method of suicide and references selecting a bridge in NYC for the ""highest chance of death.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""doubt anyone will answer me"") and resignation (""even if no one answers..."").  
   - Specific plans/methods are present: researching bridges for lethality and setting a deadline (""by the weekend"").  
   - Imminence is indicated (""gonna pick one by the weekend"").  
   - The writer expresses a clear desire for death (""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""jump from a bridge"" directly implies suicide.  
   - Yes, the context shows a desire to die (e.g., seeking the ""highest chance of death"").  
   - No negation of desire is present; the tone is resolute.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: jumping from a bridge.  
   - Preparation: Researching bridges for lethality and setting a timeline (""by the weekend"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""gonna pick one by the weekend""), not a past action.  
   - No initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of going to a bridge or attempting).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (jumping) + preparation (researching locations/timeline) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: Plan/method is explicit.  
   - Distinction from Attempt: No action initiated (only planning).

I supposed to be an alien, I supposed to suffer. This is my place in the world. I am here to live in pain. I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free. The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress, including feelings of being misunderstood, mistreated, and hopeless (e.g., ""My parents never understands me and they treat me like shit,"" ""I am here to live in pain""). It conveys a sense of despair, worthlessness, and resignation to suffering (e.g., ""I supposed to suffer,"" ""The pain will never loosen its grip,"" ""Do I deserve it?"").
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The word ""die"" is used in a metaphorical or existential context (""I will never die"") to emphasize perpetual suffering, not a literal desire for death.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present. The focus is on enduring emotional pain and a feeling of being trapped in life, not on ending life.
   - The temporal context is ongoing and general, with no imminent threats (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") related to suicide.
   - The writer's stated desire is for understanding and relief from suffering, not a wish to die. There is no expression of unwanted suicidal thoughts; instead, the distress centers on relational and identity issues.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die is expressed. Phrases like ""I will never die"" and ""I will never be free"" indicate a fear of endless suffering, not a yearning for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no element of unwanted thoughts or negation of desire. The absence of suicidal intent points toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparations (e.g., suicide notes, acquiring means) are referenced. The content lacks any planning elements related to suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional states and beliefs, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions. There is no indication of any initiated, potentially lethal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post falls under 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and despair without any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or action. The writer's focus is on suffering and a perceived lack of support, but there is no suicidal ideation or behavior. If there were ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' would be chosen, but here the content is unambiguously non-suicidal in intent.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions sister's completed suicide (past event).  
   - Author references their own past ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (initiated action).  
   - Current emotional state includes hopelessness (""why bother""), passive death wish (""the idea of [sleep] lasting forever is hard to turn away from""), and lack of future motivation.  
   - Explicitly states no current desire to act due to concern for parents (""I won’t dispute that my parents... love me"").  
   - No current plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of personal past suicide attempt (""aborted attempt at suicide"").  
   - Current expressions (""welcome end to everything,"" ""sleep lasting forever"") imply desire to escape but are tempered by protective factors (parents). No explicit *current* ""I want to die/kill myself.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Past attempt** explicitly described (""aborted attempt"") but no current plan/method/preparation.  
   - Current thoughts lack specifics about means or plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key element**: Describes a past *concrete, potentially lethal action* (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"").  
   - No recent/current initiated action. Current content focuses on ideation without behavioral indicators.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** takes precedence due to the clear description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (even if aborted).  
   - Current content (passive death wish, lack of future motivation) suggests **Ideation**, but the explicit reference to a past attempt overrides this per the rules.  
   - No current plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - Suicidal desire is present but contextualized, ruling out **Indicator**.

There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions intense hopelessness (""no hope anymore""), anhedonia (""no joy""), emotional numbness, and feeling like a failure despite achievements. 
    - Explicitly references a suicide plan: ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" and describes preparation rationale (""less of a mess""). 
    - Includes farewell/apology (""I'm sorry... Thank You""), indicating finality. 
    - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I did""). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - ""I plan on doing it"" implies ""it"" refers to suicide (contextually clear from despair and farewell). Direct desire to die is evident.  
    - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - Specific method/location mentioned: ""in the tub"" (implies drowning/cutting with reduced cleanup).  
    - Rationale (""less of a mess"") confirms planning.  
    - Farewell suggests preparatory intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Focuses on future intent (""plan on doing it"").  
    - No mention of past/ongoing actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method = **Behavior** (not Ideation, as a plan is present).  
    - No initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I attempted"") = not Attempt.  
    - Farewell/apology reinforces intent but isn’t standalone preparation.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements are a request for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please"") and an expression of distress (""I just want the pain to go away""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress and a desire for relief from pain, but no explicit hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or feeling like a burden. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. 
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. 
   - The writer's stated desire is for the pain to end, which could imply emotional suffering, but it is not framed as a wish to die; instead, it focuses on seeking support (e.g., a hug).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - It does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The statement ""I just want the pain to go away"" suggests a need for relief but not necessarily through death. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant. 
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicidal intent, so this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned or implied. 
   - Without any suicidal desire expressed, this step is not applicable, but it reinforces the lack of elements for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings of distress and a request for support, with no reference to past, current, or future suicidal actions. 
   - No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress and a desire for emotional relief but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or action. 
   - This fits 'Indicator' (general distress without clear suicidal intent). It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal desire), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires a past/recent action). 
   - Given the ambiguity rule (if unsure between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'), this is clearly 'Indicator' as there is no suicidal content.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with an explicit statement: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" directly referencing suicide.  
   - Strong emotional indicators are present (e.g., hopelessness, despair, trauma, abandonment, self-loathing).  
   - The author describes past harmful actions: secret misuse of prescribed painkillers/antidepressants and paracetamol, leading to physical harm (liver damage, vomiting, starvation). However, these actions are framed as coping mechanisms for distress (""to cope with those racing thoughts"") rather than suicide attempts.  
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for future suicide are mentioned.  
   - Temporal context: Desires are current (""I just feel like...""), but past actions (substance misuse) lack suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The opening line (""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"") is a direct expression of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""my mind... go straight to wanting to end it"" reinforce a current personal desire to die.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no statements like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While past substance misuse caused harm, it is explicitly attributed to coping, not suicide. No mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., ""I will overdose tonight""), tools, locations, or active preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past actions (substance misuse) are not described as suicidal acts but as maladaptive coping. No initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to overdose to die"") is indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it"") qualifies for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - Past substance misuse lacks suicidal intent, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - Strong distress alone would suggest **Indicator**, but explicit suicidal intent overrides this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicidal intent: ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""
   - Specific method/plan: ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair (""Fuck my life""), and references to past self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again"").
   - Describes a desire to die as a direct response to current stressors (breakup, parental conflict). No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.
   - No description of past suicide attempts or initiated actions—only current thoughts and planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and describes a desire for death via the train-track method.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Specific method (laying head on train tracks), location (train station near their house), and implied preparation (""thinking about running away""). This constitutes a clear plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts and planning (""I'm thinking about...""). No mention of past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., no description of going to the tracks or starting an attempt). Past references are to suicidal *thoughts* (""I was getting over suicidal thoughts"") and self-harm urges, not attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent are present.  
   - **Not Ideation**: While suicidal desire is clear, the post goes beyond general thoughts by specifying a method (train tracks) and location (train station).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no indication they went to the tracks or started the act).  
   - **Behavior**: The combination of explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") **and** a specific plan/method (train tracks at a named location) meets the criteria for Behavior. The phrase ""thinking about"" confirms this is planning, not action.  
   - Self-harm urges (""cutting myself"") are noted but do not override the primary suicide-specific plan.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan/method**: References past attempts but lacks details about imminent plans, methods, or active preparations for future suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past concrete actions**: ""I had a few suicide attempts"" (initiated, potentially lethal acts). One attempt specified as interrupted (""saved by someone"").  
   - **No current/future action**: While distress and desire to die are current, no initiated lethal action is described as happening now or imminently.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post revolves around **past suicide attempts** (concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions).  
   - Rules state: If past attempts are described, 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior.  
   - Current expressions of desire (""wanted to die,"" ""should be able to kill myself"") and distress qualify as ongoing ideation, but the documented past acts meet the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - No current plan/preparation pushes it away from 'Behavior'.

257,"Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real. Nothing in my life feels real. I think it's all a dream. A dream we are all so desperately attached too. Nothing about it feels real.

I feel shame for failing. I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off.

Or even if they do now, they won't eventually. Fuck me",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""trying to kill myself"" repeatedly and references past actions (""shame for failing,"" ""survival instincts"").  
   - It expresses a **desire to die** (""I'm going to try again""), **hopelessness** (""Nothing feels real""), and **guilt/shame**.  
   - A **specific plan/method** is implied: changing to a ""different method"" described as ""much easier and not so easy to back out of,"" with logistical considerations (hospital intervention, ""math"").  
   - **Temporal context**: Future intention (""tomorrow maybe,"" ""next week,"" ""next month"").  
   - **Preparation**: Mentions past attempts and adjustments to the method to avoid failure.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""trying to kill myself"" and ""I'm going to try again"" show a **current, personal desire to die**. No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. The author references a ""different method"" (though unspecified) and describes strategic adjustments to ensure lethality and reduce reversibility (""not so easy to back out""). This indicates active planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past attempts** (shame for ""failing,"" battling ""survival instincts"") but focuses on **future intent** (""try again""). No concrete, recent *initiated action* is described—only plans and past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** (→ not *Indicator*).  
   - **Plan/method is mentioned** (changing method to circumvent failure) → not *Ideation*.  
   - **No concrete, recent initiated action** (only future plans/past attempts) → not *Attempt*.  
   - **Fits *Behavior***: Explicit desire to die + specific planning (method adjustment, timing considerations like ""tomorrow"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense distress (""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""No bueno,"" ""in hell"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""It's over"") and explicit suicidal desire (""All I want is courage to end it"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (time/location), or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context: Describes current despair and a future wish (""All I want is courage...""), not an initiated act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""end it"" is a direct phrase implying suicide.  
   - **Yes**: ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a clear desire to die.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"")—suicidal intent is explicit.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method, tools, locations, or preparations described. ""End it"" is vague.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future desire (""want courage to end it"").  
   - **No** mention of past/current initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No initiated lethal action → Rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""I'm offing myself"" and ""going out of this world."" It expresses emotional indicators of hopelessness (""I'm not worth living"") and a clear desire to die. There is a specific plan indicated by the exact date (April 13, 2021) and time (13:14 hours) for the suicidal act. No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or physical preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned, but the temporal specificity (""at that time"") and the goodbye message (""Goodbye world"") suggest planning. The context is future-oriented, with no references to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide (""offing myself"") and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm not worth living,"" ""going out of this world""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; it is stated as an intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific plan is mentioned via the exact date and time for the suicidal act (""April 13, 2021"" and ""13:14 hours""), which constitutes planning. However, no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or explicit preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools) are described. The ""Goodbye world"" could imply a farewell note, but it is not explicitly stated as a preparation. Since the temporal specificity indicates a concrete plan for when the act will occur, this leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going out... at that time,"" ""I'm offing myself then""), not a past or recent action. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'. It includes a specific temporal plan (date and time), which goes beyond mere thoughts or general ideation. While no method is specified, the detailed timing constitutes a plan element, aligning with 'Behavior'. If the plan were ambiguous, 'Ideation' would be chosen, but the specificity here is clear. No past action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: Explicit expressions of despair (""I dont want to live,"" ""I want to die peacefuly,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad""), hopelessness (""It will never be better""), self-loathing (""piece of shit""), and anger toward societal/gender dynamics. 
    - Mentions death/suicide: Direct phrases include ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and repeated declarations of being ""done"" with life.  
    - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness (feeling rejected/unworthy), and anhedonia (no hope for future happiness).  
    - Plan/method/preparation: **No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned. Getting drunk is described as a current coping mechanism, not a suicide method.  
    - Past actions: No reference to prior attempts or self-harm actions.

    - Stated desire: Explicit wish to die (""I want to kill myself so bad"") without negation or expression of unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Describes **current emotional state and suicidal desire** but **no past or recent initiated lethal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - **Explicit desire to die** places this above *Indicator* (which requires no genuine suicidal intent).  
    - **Absence of a plan, method, or preparation** rules out *Behavior*.  
    - **No description of past/recent concrete suicidal actions** rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses feelings of being a burden (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"") and emotional distress (""I just can't do this anymore,"" ""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause"").  
   - There is a strong desire to end suffering (""I have to make it stop"") but **no explicit mention of death, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods**.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and perceived burdensomeness.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die.  
   - ""I have to make it stop"" implies ending distress but **does not state a wish to die**; it focuses on stopping pain.  
   - The sentiment leans toward distress about existence (e.g., ""can't do this anymore""), but without expressing active suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None present**. No methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional suffering but **no reference to past actions** (e.g., attempts) or imminent plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core message is **distress, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden**, but it lacks:  
     - Explicit personal desire to die (required for Ideation).  
     - Any plan/method (required for Behavior).  
     - Past/recent actions (required for Attempt).  
   - While ""make it stop"" could be interpreted as suicidal ideation, the absence of explicit suicidal intent or desire to die aligns better with **Indicator** (general distress without clear suicidal desire).  
   - Per rules: If ambiguous between Indicator and Ideation, default to **Indicator**.

I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""nothing is better than this""), isolation (""lost and alone""), self-loathing (""I hate myself""), and feeling like a burden (""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but their lives would be better""). 
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present: ""I would have done it already"" directly indicates a wish to act on suicidal thoughts, contingent only on fear of failure (""afraid of botching it""). 
   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines). 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; references to suicide are hypothetical (""would have done"") or conditional (""if I wasn’t so afraid"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The author explicitly states they ""would have done it already"" (suicide) if not for fear of failure, confirming a genuine desire to die. The phrase ""I don’t belong here"" reinforces this intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While fear of ""botching it"" implies awareness of methods, no concrete plan, means, or preparations are specified. The absence of details (e.g., *how* they would attempt) rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No initiated actions**. The post describes suicidal thoughts and desire but no past or recent attempts (e.g., no ""I tried X yesterday""). The focus is on hypotheticals and barriers to action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** is the best fit:  
     - The author explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I would have done it already"") and end their life.  
     - No plan/method/preparation is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
     - No description of past/current suicidal actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
     - While distress is severe, the presence of active suicidal desire moves this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires the absence of personal intent to die).  
     - Fear of failure (""afraid of botching it"") does not negate the underlying desire to die; it merely delays action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""I would say I'm suicidal"" and expresses comfort with ""leaving this life."" 
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""glass being empty,"" ""no success,"" ""failure,"" ""waste of space,"" ""serve no purpose""), despair (""can't seem to get my life together""), and perceived burden (""failure to my son"").
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specifies waiting ""till he's an adult"" (11 years from now) but **no concrete method, tools, location, or preparations** mentioned. The timeline is distant and abstract.
   - Past actions: No description of prior suicide attempts or self-harm actions. Only references enduring depression.
   - Imminence: Intent is explicitly deferred (""11 more years""). No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire: Expresses suicidal thoughts and comfort with dying but **explicitly negates current intent** (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") due to his son.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**, explicitly states ""I'm suicidal"" and ""comfortable with leaving this life.""  
   - However, **desire to act is directly negated** (""don't have the balls,"" ""my son doesn't deserve that""), framing suicidal thoughts as unwanted in the present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **No specific method, tools, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes). The mention of waiting 11 years is a conditional timeline, not a plan with actionable steps.  
   - Vague future intent without concrete details does not qualify as ""planning.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Focuses on **future hypothetical intent** (""11 more years then yes"").  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described (e.g., no reference to prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (""I'm suicidal""), but it is **coupled with clear negation of current intent** and **no plan/method**.  
   - The distant, non-specific timeline and lack of actionable planning align with **Ideation** (desire to die without a plan).  
   - Strong distress/hopelessness is present, but the explicit personal suicidal thoughts elevate it above ""Indicator.""  
   - Rules: ""If no desire to die is expressed, choose Indicator"" – here, desire *is* expressed but not acted upon. ""If no plan/method, choose Ideation"" applies.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with the phrase ""I need to kill myself,"" indicating a direct personal expression of suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""life just isn't worth it""), anhedonia (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), and despair (""completely failing school""). The author also expresses concern about the impact on family and friends, showing ambivalence but not negating the desire to die.
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present; the content focuses on current thoughts and future considerations.
   - The author's stated desire is to die (""I need to kill myself""), with the concern about hurting others reflecting distress but not a rejection of suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it"").
   - The author does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; instead, the concern for family/friends is secondary to the expressed desire, so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The question ""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends"" relates to consequences, not to planning or executing suicide, and does not imply a method.
   - Without any clear plan or preparation elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions with no indication of past or recent initiated actions. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal act that was started (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of current suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.
   - The content fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a desire to die with suicidal thoughts but without any plan, method, or action. The ambivalence about family impact does not change the core expression of suicidal intent.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I'll be gone"" (implying death or not being alive), expresses hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around,"" ""no point in trying""), despair (""tired of fighting""), and feeling trapped in a cycle of depression. There are no specific references to suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or locations. No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on future intent (""by this time next week""). The emotional tone is one of resignation, but the desire to die is implied rather than explicitly stated with terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""I'll be gone"" is not an explicit mention of suicide or killing oneself (e.g., no direct words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but it strongly implies a desire to not be alive in the context of despair. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author doesn't want to act on them (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""). This leans toward 'Ideation' due to the personal expression of a wish to be gone.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye) are mentioned. ""I'll be gone"" is vague and doesn't detail how this will happen. Without any explicit plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references a future timeframe (""by this time next week"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed). The content is about intention, not action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (implied by ""I'll be gone"") in a context of hopelessness, which aligns with 'Ideation' (explicit personal suicidal thoughts without a plan or method). It is not 'Indicator' because the author's statement goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts—it conveys a genuine wish to not be alive. There is no plan or method, so it is not 'Behavior'. No past action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'. The ambiguity around explicit suicide terminology is resolved by the clear intent in context, supporting 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""die,"" ""survive another attempt,"" ""medical bill,"" and ""I just want to die."" It explicitly references a past suicide attempt (implied by ""another attempt"" and the mention of medical bills) and expresses a strong current desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident, particularly around the burden of parental criticism and the explicit wish not to survive a future attempt.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Direct phrases like ""I hope I don't make it"" and ""I just want to die"" indicate a personal desire for death. ""Survive another attempt"" confirms a past suicidal action.
   - Plan, method, or preparation: No specific new plan, method, or preparation for a future attempt is described (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing). The focus is on the aftermath of a past attempt and the desire to avoid survival.
   - References to past actions: ""Another attempt"" clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that resulted in medical intervention (as indicated by the medical bill). This action was interrupted or failed, leading to survival.
   - Imminence: No immediate timing for a new attempt is stated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire is general.
   - Stated desire: The writer expresses a genuine wish to die (""I just want to die"") without indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions death and suicide through phrases like ""I hope I don't make it"" (in the context of an attempt) and ""I just want to die,"" showing a clear, personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for a current or future attempt. The reference to ""another attempt"" is about the past event and its consequences, not a new plan. Without explicit details of a current plan, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past suicidal action (""another attempt"") that was initiated and potentially lethal (as evidenced by medical bills and survival). This is a concrete, self-initiated event. It also expresses a current desire to die but no new initiated action. The past attempt takes precedence per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post does not fit 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because, while there is a current desire to die, the explicit reference to a past attempt overshadows the ideation.
   - It does not fit 'Behavior' because no current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for a new attempt.
   - It fits 'Attempt' because it describes a past, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (the previous attempt that led to medical bills). The rules state that if a past attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' takes precedence, even with current ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and describes them as intense and escalating.  
   - Key phrases: ""death is the only escape"" (desire for death as relief), ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" (explicit ideation), ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life"" (hopelessness).  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  
   - The writer expresses a persistent desire for death as an escape but does not negate or reject this desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly uses ""suicidal thoughts.""  
   - **Yes**, it expresses a clear desire for death (e.g., ""death is the only escape"").  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don’t want to act on them"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.  
   - The focus is on the intensity of thoughts and emotional state, not actionable plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts (""as the days pass,"" ""wake immediately"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal actions**.  
   - No references to concrete attempts (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die and personal suicidal thoughts place this beyond *Indicator* (which requires lack of personal desire).  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No described past/recent initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: explicit desire to die (""death is the only escape"") and personal suicidal thoughts, but no plan/method.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post discusses past events involving self-harm with suicidal undertones. Key elements include:
     - Mentions of ""suicide attempt"" and ""vaguely suicidal stuff.""
     - Emotional indicators like distress (""bothered me afterwards""), burden (""weighing on me""), and hopelessness (""It's pretty fucked"").
     - Specific methods are implied but not named, with references to ""testing my method"" and reaching ""the point of no return."" Preparations or actions are described in past events.
     - References to two past actions: one as a test (no intent to die), the other with intent to die (""intention of dying"") but stopped both times.
     - Imminence is low; events happened ""in the past year or two"" and are not current. The author is now in a ""tenuously better situation"" but is preoccupied with categorizing these events.
     - Stated desire: In the second event, there was a clear desire to die, but currently, the author expresses distress about the memories, not a present wish to act. No explicit current suicidal intent is stated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide attempt"" and describes personal experiences with suicidal actions.
   - In the past (second event), a clear desire to die is expressed: ""I went in with the intention of dying."" However, this is historical, not current.
   - Currently, suicidal thoughts are discussed as distressing (""struggle to not think about""), but there is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted in a way that negates desire. The focus is on past actions and current confusion, not a present wish to die.
   - Since the explicit desire to die is tied to past events and not current, this leans toward historical intent rather than ongoing ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method is implied in both past events (e.g., ""point of no return"" suggests a lethal means like suffocation or hanging), and actions were taken (e.g., ""testing my method,"" going to near-lethal points).
   - However, this is all historical; there is no mention of current plans, methods, or preparations. The author reflects on the past without indicating any ongoing behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes two past actions. The second event is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: the author intended to die and initiated the method but stopped due to fear. This fits the definition of a suicide attempt (interrupted by self).
   - The first event was a test without intent, so it does not qualify as an attempt.
   - No current or future intentions are described; the author is processing past events. The rules state that if a past attempt is clearly described (as in the second event), it should be classified as 'Attempt', even with current distress.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because the post goes beyond general distress; it includes explicit descriptions of personal suicidal actions with intent.
   - 'Ideation' is not the best fit because the core content is about past initiated actions, not current thoughts or desire without a plan.
   - 'Behavior' does not apply as there is no indication of current planning or preparation.
   - 'Attempt' fits because the second event is a concrete, past suicide attempt (initiated lethal action with intent, interrupted by self). The rules prioritize this category when such actions are described, regardless of current mental state.

Final classification: 'Attempt' based on the detailed description of a past suicide attempt.

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key elements**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""nothing ever gets better""), despair (""I was never meant to be happy""), self-loathing (""I am the one ruining my own life""), and distrust of others. It explicitly states, ""I really want to die"" and includes wishes to ""kill off my emotions"" or escape suffering.  
   - **Explicit suicide/death intent**: The phrase ""I really want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  
   - **Plan/method/preparation**: No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are mentioned. Anger toward others (""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer"") implies harm to others, not self-directed plans.  
   - **Temporal context/action**: Describes past trauma (abuse, bullying) and ongoing distress but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). Focus is on current emotional pain and desire to die, not initiated acts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, ""I really want to die"" confirms a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL/ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No** mention of past or recent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I really want to die"") rules out **Indicator** (which requires absence of personal suicidal desire).  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of initiated suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The core qualifies as **Ideation**: explicit desire to die without plans/methods.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and ""looking up how to do it,"" indicating active suicidal thoughts and research into methods.
   - Expresses despair (""this nightmare,"" ""never ending pit""), hopelessness (""destroys any hope of me getting better""), and explicit desire to end life.
   - Specifies methods: ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself.""
   - Notes temporal context: ""every hour,"" ""for a month,"" and current school experiences suggest ongoing ideation.
   - No indication of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or past initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried""). The phrase ""I wish I had the courage"" implies desire without action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself,"" showing personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") are mentioned. Research (""looking up how to do it"") implies planning but no explicit preparations (e.g., ""I bought a knife"") or imminent timeline.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts and research but **no concrete past/recent initiated action**. The phrase ""I wish"" frames methods as hypothetical desires, not attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (""wish I had the courage"") + specific methods (""jump/stab"") + research (""looking up how"") = **Behavior** (method/plan indicated).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/initiated self-harm.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not abstract/unwanted.

If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""I'm so fucking done""), despair (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad""), and feelings of isolation/betrayal.
   - Mentions a desire to escape (""I want to leave and never come back"") and a nihilistic wish for universal death (""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all"").
   - **No explicit references to suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means** (e.g., pills, cutting). The nuclear bomb reference is a hypothetical, impersonal scenario.
   - **No stated desire for personal suicide**; the focus is on emotional pain and a wish for collective annihilation to end suffering universally.
   - **No plans, preparations, or past actions** related to self-harm. The ""leave and never come back"" is metaphorical, not literal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""
   - Desires expressed (""I don't want to be here,"" ""I want out"") reflect **distress and escapism**, not a clear, personal wish to die by suicide. The nuclear bomb wish is externalized (a passive event affecting all) and lacks personal intent.
   - **No suicidal thoughts are claimed or negated**; the core sentiment is hopelessness, not active suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned. The nuclear bomb is not a feasible/actionable plan for the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Focuses on **current emotional state** and past relational trauma (ex-partner). **No description of past/ongoing self-harm actions or attempts**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows severe distress but **lacks explicit personal desire for suicide**, a plan, or preparatory behavior. Key phrases (""want out,"" ""leave"") are ambiguous but lean toward escapism, not active suicidal intent. The nuclear bomb wish is a metaphor for universal relief, not self-targeted harm.  
   - **""Indicator""** fits: expressions of hopelessness and abstract death references without personal suicidal desire. Ambiguity around ""wanting out"" defaults to Indicator per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger,"" which refers to suicide by firearm. It expresses emotional distress related to racial pressure (""because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color"") and hopelessness. The phrase ""pull the trigger"" indicates a specific method (using a gun). There is no mention of past actions, preparations (e.g., having a gun, writing a note), or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""), but it conveys a current desire and intent for future action. The writer expresses a genuine wish to die, not unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; they are actively endorsed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, ""pull the trigger"" specifies a method (firearm) for suicide, even if details like possession of a gun or exact timing are not provided. This mention of a method shifts the classification toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions. It is not describing an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (""pull the trigger"") elevates it beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior', as 'Behavior' requires a plan or method. There is no described past action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The focus is solely on the author's stated intent and method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") but frames it as a historical action.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""No one cares,"" ""tired of putting a mask,"" ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").  
   - Explicitly links emotional pain to a desire for death as an escape (""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").  
   - No specific suicide plan, method, preparation, or timeline mentioned.  
   - No reference to a concrete *recent* or *future* suicidal action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. While ""suicide"" isn’t directly stated, the phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a clear personal desire to die as relief from suffering. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. Past self-harm is noted, but it’s framed as non-lethal (""hurt myself"") and historical. No tools, locations, or suicide-specific preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned for current/future actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past self-harm (""two months ago"") is described, but it’s ambiguous whether this was a suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI). The post focuses on current despair, not a recent or imminent lethal act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit desire for death (""Death seems like the only place..."") moves this beyond general distress (Indicator) into personal suicidal desire (Ideation).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is indicated. Past self-harm alone doesn’t imply a current plan.  
   - **Ideation vs. Attempt**: The historical self-harm lacks context of being a potentially lethal *suicide attempt* (e.g., no mention of intent to die). The core focus is current ideation.

I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling alone, sad, and suicidal daily.  
   - Explicitly states: ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""write detailed plans in my journal,"" ""think about suicide every day,"" and ""seriously consider it.""  
   - Notes preparations (writing plans in a journal) and frequent ideation.  
   - **Crucially negates intent**: ""I know I would never do it"" due to fear of hell and expresses a strong desire for help/recovery.  
   - No specific method, timeline, or active preparations (e.g., acquiring tools). No past/current suicidal actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, suicidal thoughts/ideation are explicitly mentioned.

   - Preparations (journaling) are passive and lack concrete planning for action.  
   - Strong emphasis on distress, desire for help, and fear of consequences (hospitalization/hell) aligns with **Indicator**, as the core sentiment is *distress about thoughts*, not a current desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress with "":("", ""I cant take it anymore,"" and ""The pain is unreal,"" indicating hopelessness and despair.
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations.
   - No references to past actions, temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight""), or stated desire to die.
   - The focus is on general emotional pain and being overwhelmed, without suicidal elements.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). 
   - The statement ""I cant take it anymore"" implies distress but not a personal wish for death; it's ambiguous and lacks suicidal intent.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned or negated, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing). 
   - Without any planning elements, it cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes current feelings of pain and overwhelm, not past or recent actions.
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""commiting suicide sober,"" which explicitly references suicide and the state of being sober. It also references AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) and ""Higher Power,"" suggesting a context of recovery or spiritual support.
   - There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair explicitly stated; the tone is somewhat ironic or resigned, but not overtly emotional.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on capability (""capable of commiting suicide"") rather than intent or action.
   - There are no references to past actions, such as previous suicide attempts or self-harm.
   - No temporal context indicating imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is present.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous: It expresses capability (""I think I'm capable"") but does not explicitly state a current desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""That's the Higher Power in action"" adds irony but does not clarify desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in ""commiting suicide.""
   - However, it does not express a clear, current personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). Instead, it focuses on capability (""I think I'm capable"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are implied through capability, but the writer does not state whether these thoughts are unwanted or desired. There is no explicit negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"").
   - Due to the lack of explicit desire, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied.
   - The absence of any planning elements means this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current state of capability (""I think I'm capable"") but no past, recent, or future actions.
   - No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die, placing it between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.
   - 'Ideation' requires explicit desire or thoughts of suicide (e.g., ""I want to die""), but here the focus is on capability without stated intent.
   - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are ruled out due to no plan, method, or action.
   - Ambiguity exists about genuine suicidal desire, so per the rule (""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator""), 'Indicator' is the appropriate category.
   - The suicide risk is only for the author, and the content aligns with 'Indicator' as it discusses suicide abstractly in the context of personal capability, without explicit desire, plan, or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Key elements: Strong expressions of distress (""I'm a piece of shit,"" ""I hate every part of my life""), hopelessness (""Don't want to do this anymore""), and a desire for relief (""I just want it to be over,"" ""I want to be down""). Mentions being drunk but no references to death, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, self-loathing, exhaustion (""sick and tired""), isolation.  
   - Explicit suicide/death intent? Phrases like ""want it to be over"" and ""want to be down"" imply a wish to escape suffering but **lack explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself.""** The plea (""Please please please"") suggests distress, not a confirmed desire to act.  
   - Plan/method/preparation? **None mentioned** (no tools, locations, notes, or timelines).  
   - Temporal context/action? Describes current emotional state; **no past or imminent actions** (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No direct phrases (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - ""Want it to be over"" expresses despair but is **ambiguous about genuine death-seeking intent**; coupled with the plea for help, it leans toward distress about suffering rather than active suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION:**  
   - **Absent**. Drunkenness is a state, not a method/preparation.  

4. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The core sentiment is **distress and hopelessness** without explicit personal desire to die by suicide.  
   - Ambiguous phrases (e.g., ""want it to be over"") lack specificity for suicidal intent; the plea (""Please"") further supports distress.  
   - **No plan, method, or past action** rules out Ideation/Behavior/Attempt.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Expresses severe emotional pain and a wish to escape suffering, but lacks clear, current personal suicidal intent or planning.

279,I have attempted suicide 11 times. I have embraced my role in the universe as an existential terrorist. I will use my suicide to disturb people for my own satiafaction. I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" indicating past actions of potentially lethal self-harm.
   - It expresses future intent: ""I will use my suicide to disturb people,"" confirming a current desire to die and a plan to weaponize suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hatred (""I hate capitalism..."") and a distorted sense of purpose (""existential terrorist,"" ""for my own satisfaction"").
   - Key elements: Past suicide attempts (concrete actions), future suicidal intent with a stated purpose (disturbance), but no specific new method/preparation details beyond the declared intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned twice (""attempted suicide,"" ""use my suicide""), and ""I will use my suicide"" confirms an active desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Future plan: ""I will use my suicide to disturb people"" implies intent but lacks specific new method/preparation details (e.g., tools, timeline). However, past attempts (""11 times"") confirm prior methods/actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Past actions: ""attempted suicide 11 times"" describes concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions.
   - Future intent: ""I will use my suicide"" indicates current suicidal desire but no new actionable steps beyond the declaration.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post centers on **past suicide attempts** (""attempted suicide 11 times""). Per the rules, any description of concrete past potentially lethal actions by the author qualifies as 'Attempt', even if current ideation/behavior is also present. The future statement (""I will use my suicide"") reinforces risk but does not override the precedence of the explicitly described past attempts.

The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions past suicide attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""
   - Expresses emotional distress: ""given up completely,"" ""just want the pain to end,"" ""don't recognise myself.""
   - Describes life struggles (breakup, depression, job loss, loneliness) but no current plan/method/preparation for suicide.
   - No temporal immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") for future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of personal suicide actions: ""Tried to kill myself.""  
   - Desire to end pain is stated, but suicidal intent is framed as past behavior.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTICATION:**
   - No current plan, method, or preparation described. References to past attempts lack method details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Key phrase: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" confirms **past initiated actions** (attempts).  
   - Current statements (""I just want the pain to end"") express distress but no active planning or imminent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Past suicide attempts (""tried to kill myself"") are concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions, fitting the **Attempt** definition.  
   - Current expressions of despair (""given up,"" ""want the pain to end"") lack plan/method, but the disclosed history of attempts takes precedence per rules.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""I am in hell,"" ""so alone,"" ""depression and physical pain,"" ""high anxiety,"" hopelessness (""It doesn't get better,"" ""no miracle is coming"").  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide/death: ""accomplish death,"" detailed discussion of methods (shotgun, handguns, overdosing), and fears of failed suicide outcomes (e.g., paralysis).  
   - Specific methods are analyzed: caliber differences for handguns, shooting through the upper palate, and risks of overdose (referencing Mark Linkous).  
   - No indication of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). The focus is on fears, research, and hypothetical outcomes.  
   - The phrase ""End it now"" is generalized (directed at ""you""), not a stated personal intent to act imminently.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly expresses a desire to die (""accomplish death"") and personally evaluates suicide methods. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (firearms, overdose) are discussed in detail, including technical considerations (caliber, placement). The author has ""looked into"" options, indicating research/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent concrete suicidal actions. Mentions are hypothetical (""if shooting myself"") or referential (Mark Linkous’s overdose).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (Ideation threshold met) + **specific method/preparation** (firearm/overdose research) = **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated lethal action (rules out Attempt).  
   - ""End it now"" is not a personal imminent plan but a nihilistic statement to others.

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post expresses distress (""Can't do any of it!"") and a strong desire to escape (""don't want this anymore""). The phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a metaphor for death, indicating a wish to not be alive. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair. No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes), or past actions are mentioned. The desire is current but not time-bound (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:** 
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""never ever wake up"" clearly expresses a personal desire to die, not just distress about unwanted thoughts. The author is stating a wish to not be alive, which aligns with suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:** 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is mentioned. The content focuses solely on the desire to die, without any planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:** 
   - The post describes a current wish with no reference to past or imminent actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:** 
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""never ever wake up""), which fits 'Ideation.' There is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior.' No past or recent action is described, so it is not 'Attempt.' While the language is metaphorical, the intent is explicit enough to move beyond 'Indicator,' which would apply if the desire were ambiguous or unwanted. Since the desire is personal and current, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings and desires. **No description** of past/initiated actions (e.g., no reference to an actual attempt).

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains strong expressions of distress and hopelessness. Key elements include:
   - Explicit phrases indicating a desire to die: ""make me want to die,"" ""I want to not exist,"" ""I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore.""
   - Emotional indicators: Anger, guilt, despair (""I'm done,"" ""I have no one else,"" ""can't see a solution or a way out"").
   - Mentions of suicidal thoughts: ""fighting the urge to go wandering off into the night"" and hoping ""something bad happens"" to end suffering.
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, notes) is mentioned.

   - Focuses on *current* emotional state and urges.  
   - **No** description of past/recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to...""). Urges are resisted (""fighting the urge"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""ideations of suicide"" and ""most days I wish I wasn't alive"" explicitly express suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing seems worth it""), shame, isolation, depression, and feelings of being a burden (""people would be better off without me"").
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts (only ideation and internal struggle).
   - Imminence is not indicated; the focus is on persistent thoughts and daily distress.
   - The writer explicitly states they conceal ideations from their therapist but does *not* express these thoughts as unwanted or disavow the desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I don’t want these thoughts"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""ideations of suicide"" and ""wish I wasn’t alive"" directly express a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No method/preparation**: No mention of specific tools, locations, substances, or concrete steps toward acting on suicidal thoughts. The ideation remains abstract.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes ongoing distress and suicidal thoughts but **no initiated action** (past or recent). Focus is solely on current ideation and emotional state.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""wish I wasn’t alive"") and personal admission of suicidal ideation confirm 'Ideation'. The absence of disavowal (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"") rules out 'Indicator'.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so 'Behavior' does not apply.
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/current concrete, potentially lethal actions.
   - **Conclusion**: The post fits 'Ideation' due to clear expressions of suicidal desire without plans or actions.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""pointless situation""), anxiety, fear of consequences.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described; the metaphor is abstract.  
   - Writer explicitly states they **do not act** due to fear of surviving (""never can because I'm afraid"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die. The metaphor implies a wish to *stop suffering*, not necessarily to die.  
   - Writer negates acting on the urge (""never can""), framing it as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations mentioned. The ""crashing"" is hypothetical and metaphorical.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes recurring thoughts (""frequently come close"") but **no past or recent initiated action**. The phrase ""never can"" confirms no attempt occurred.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress and intrusive thoughts about ending suffering (via metaphor) but lacks a **personal desire to die** or explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Fear of acting and framing the urge as unwanted (""never can"") aligns with **distress about thoughts, not a current wish to die**.  
   - No plan/method → Not *Behavior* or *Attempt*.  
   - Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire → Default to **Indicator** per rules.

289,"My only friend, who treats me more than well when he's here, doesn't talk to me for 6+ mo on. Not even a simple text. We were supposed to meet up two mo ago but he bailed on me two days in a row. I can't get him to understand how I'm feeling and I'm so tired of this empty loneliness I feel. My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit mention: ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct declaration of suicidal intent.
    - Emotional indicators: Loneliness (""empty loneliness""), exhaustion (""so tired""), and distress from abuse.
    - Temporal context: ""Only a matter of when"" implies inevitability but lacks specificity (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tomorrow"").
    - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes).
    - No description of past actions/attempts or interrupted behaviors.
    - The writer expresses a clear desire to die without indicating these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes: ""I'm going to kill myself"" is an explicit, personal declaration of intent to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - No: There is no reference to a specific plan, method (e.g., tools/substances), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes a future intention (""going to kill myself"") with no indication of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**.
    - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
    - No description of past/recent concrete actions rules out **Attempt**.
    - The presence of personal suicidal intent distinguishes this from **Indicator**.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""death is an option"" and questions whether thinking about death as an option constitutes a suicidal thought. The author explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no intention to act on suicidal impulses. Death is framed as a passive, hypothetical outcome (e.g., from an accident) rather than an active choice. There is no expression of hopelessness, despair, or emotional distress beyond a resigned acceptance that death ""isn't the worst outcome."" No specific plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or imminent intentions for suicide are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thought"" but only in a questioning context, not as a personal expression of desire. The author explicitly negates any intent with ""I won't commit."" The desire for death is not expressed; instead, it is hypothetical and conditional on accidents, suggesting the thoughts are unwanted or abstract. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to accidental death is not a method of self-harm. With no plan or preparation elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses thoughts about death in a general, future-hypothetical context (e.g., ""if somehow I got an accident""). There is no description of past or recent initiated actions, attempts, or concrete events related to suicide. The focus is on cognitive questioning rather than behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content expresses general thoughts about death and questions whether they constitute suicidal ideation, but the author explicitly states no desire to act (""I won't commit""). This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes abstract discussions of suicide, unwanted thoughts, or passive acceptance of death without a current, personal desire to die. There is no explicit suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt, ruling out 'Ideation', 'Behavior', and 'Attempt'. Ambiguity about suicidal desire further supports 'Indicator' as the default when intent is unclear or negated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill me.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""ran out of time,"" ""I wish I didn't have to do this"") and resolve (""wont lose the oportunity"").
   - Plan/method/preparation: ""Tonight"" (imminent timing), ""planned this,"" ""have the stuff prepared.""
   - Past actions: References a year-long plan but no description of an initiated suicidal act.
   - Desire to die: Explicit (""kill me"") with ambivalence (""I wish I didn’t have to""), but the overall tone confirms intent (""im doing the right after all"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: Directly states ""kill me"" and confirms intent (""wont lose the oportunity""). Ambivalence (""I wish I didn’t have to"") does not negate the active desire to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes: Specific imminent timeframe (""tonight""), preparations (""stuff prepared""), and references to a long-term plan (""a year since i planned this"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a future intention (""Tonight"") with preparations but **no mention of a past or recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). The focus is on impending action, not completed behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Clear desire to die + explicit plan/preparation → **Behavior** (not Ideation).  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated action → Not Attempt.  
   - Ambivalence does not override explicit intent/plan → Not Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" but negates acting on it directly with ""I'm too much of a pussy to kill myself,"" indicating reluctance or fear of direct suicide methods.
   - It describes an alternative method: ""stop eating all together and stave myself"" (starve myself), with the hope that ""my body breaks down slowly and this just ends,"" expressing a clear desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I see no reason to fuel it with energy""), self-hatred (""I hate my body""), and despair.
   - A specific method (starvation) is mentioned, and a decision has been made (""I've decided""), but there are no explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) beyond the stated intention.
   - The context is future-oriented (""I hope my body breaks down""), with no mention of past actions or attempts.
   - The desire to die is personal and current, as evidenced by the plan to starve oneself to end suffering.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" and phrases like ""this just ends"" convey a clear desire to not be alive.
   - Although the author states an inability to act on direct suicide, they express an active wish to die through starvation, so suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or distressing in a way that negates intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (starvation) is mentioned: ""stop eating all together and stave myself.""
   - There is an indication of intention (""I've decided""), but no concrete preparations (e.g., giving away possessions, setting a timeline) are described. However, the explicit mention of a method shifts this toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I've decided to stop eating"") with no evidence of initiated action. It is not a past or recent event, so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator') and includes a specific method (starvation), which elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method).
   - While there is ambivalence about direct suicide, the active choice of an alternative lethal method (starvation) with clear intent supports 'Behavior'.
   - No action has been initiated, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the author has suicidal intent coupled with a stated method.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone. Much love to anyone reading ❤️",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress (""not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness"") and references past suffering. 
   - It mentions ""I don't always wish to be gone,"" explicitly negating a consistent desire to die. 
   - No mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. 
   - The tone emphasizes endurance (""somehow I'm still standing,"" ""life is never easy"") and a plea for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - The phrase ""wish to be gone"" is qualified by ""I don't always,"" indicating fluctuating feelings without a current, clear desire to die. The primary sentiment is distress about emotional pain, not a stated intent to end life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Absent. No references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Discusses past hardships but no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and passive thoughts of not wanting to exist (""wish to be gone"") but explicitly frames them as inconsistent and undesired. No plan, method, or past attempt is indicated. This aligns with **Indicator**, which captures distress and unwanted/abstract thoughts of death without explicit suicidal desire or intent.

I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal"" explicitly and expresses hopelessness (""permanently fucked up this life,"" ""barely having anything to look forward to""), despair (""depressed constantly""), feelings of being a burden (""I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause""), and a desire for escape (""wish I could restart,"" ""wish I wasn't so broken"").
   - No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - The writer expresses distress about suicidal thoughts but does not explicitly state they *do not want* to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states the author is ""suicidal"" and indirectly expresses a desire to escape life (""wish I wasn't so broken,"" ""want a restart""). Though the phrasing is less direct than ""I want to die,"" the combination of explicit suicidal labeling and hopelessness indicates a genuine desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**: There is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., timing, location), or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The focus is on emotional pain and ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts. No past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned. Phrases like ""destroyed myself"" refer to emotional/psychological harm, not physical self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal"" and desire to escape life confirms **Ideation** (personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire to die).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of past/initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.
   - While the writer expresses distress about the impact of their death on their sibling, this does not negate their expressed desire to escape life or their explicit suicidal state. Thus, it is not **Indicator** (which requires no personal desire to die).

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""end myself,"" ""take my own life,"" ""it is probably best I head out before it gets worse.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing is happening,"" ""stagnant""), despair (""destroyed my body,"" ""pathetic""), feeling trapped (""can't quit,"" ""family will lift a fuss"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes).
   - No past actions described (e.g., no ""I tried X"" or ""I took Y"").
   - Imminence: ""I don't know if or when"" and ""If nothing changes"" suggest contemplation without immediacy.
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""end myself,"" ""take my own life"") without negation or expression of these thoughts as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. Direct phrases include ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""end myself,"" and ""take my own life."" The desire to die is personally expressed and not framed as unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned or implied.
   - No references to acquiring means, writing notes, or choosing locations.
   - Preparations are absent; the post focuses on ideation and rationale, not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Discusses current/future intentions (""I don't know if or when"") but no description of past or recent concrete actions (e.g., no initiated suicide attempts).
   - All references to suicide are hypothetical or contemplative.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong explicit desire to die (""end myself"") and personal suicidal thoughts place this beyond general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While suicidal intent is clear, no plan, method, or preparations are indicated. The absence of specifics (e.g., ""how"" or ""with what"") rules out Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/current initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits 'Ideation' due to expressed desire to die without concrete plans or methods.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw attachment on,"" ""followed the lines.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" ""want to get it over with.""  
   - Specific method/preparation: Researching the radial artery, marking its location, using a dremel tool with a saw attachment.  
   - Imminence: ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late"" implies the act occurred immediately before posting.  
   - Action described: Self-injury initiated (""I just slit my wrists,"" ""followed the lines"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""slit my wrists,"" ""my death,"" and ""Goodbye"" confirm a clear desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method (cutting radial artery), tool (dremel with saw attachment), and preparation (researching anatomy, marking arteries) are detailed.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: ""I just slit my wrists"" (past tense), ""followed the lines,"" and the note being posted post-attempt. This fits the 'Attempt' definition of a concrete, initiated act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details a **concrete, self-initiated action** (cutting wrists with a tool) that is potentially lethal, fulfilling the core criterion for 'Attempt.'  
   - The presence of planning (research, marking arteries) and explicit intent supports this, but the *initiated action* takes precedence over preparatory behavior.  
   - Rules clarify that past/recent actions dominate current ideation/behavior in classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author explicitly states: ""I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to keep going"") and internal conflict about hypocrisy.  
   - **No mentions** of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, notes), or timelines.  
   - **No references** to past suicidal actions or attempts by the author.  
   - The suicidal desire is current and personal but lacks concrete details about execution.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and expresses a personal desire to not continue living (""I don't want to keep going""). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; they are presented as a genuine current state.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned. The author discusses feelings and internal conflict but provides no details about *how* they might act on suicidal thoughts (e.g., means, location, steps taken).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **current suicidal feelings** but **no past or recent actions**. The author explicitly states they have never disclosed these thoughts before, and there is no description of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a **clear personal desire to die** (suicidal ideation) but **lacks any mention of a plan, method, or preparation**. This aligns with **Ideation**.  
   - There is no ambiguity about the desire being unwanted (e.g., no language like ""I don’t want these thoughts""), so **Indicator** does not apply.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""do something bad"" is vague and not tied to a concrete plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario (""If I become worse..."") with no indication of past or recent initiated actions. The conditional language (""if"") suggests contemplation, not imminent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") is present, meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.
    - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.

   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself at this point"" directly expresses a current desire to die.  
   - **Ambivalence**: ""I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not"" indicates conflicting feelings but does not negate the explicit desire to die stated earlier.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation**: No mention of tools, locations, or concrete steps (e.g., pills, notes, locations).  
   - **No past/recent actions**: No description of initiated suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""trying to kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent. The ambivalence (""I'm also not"") coexists but does not override the explicit statement of active suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current** emotional state and suicidal desire (""at this point"").  
   - **No initiated actions**: No references to past/ongoing lethal behaviors (e.g., ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit desire to die (""trying to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is present, so 'Behavior' does not apply.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent, as no concrete actions were described.  
   - **Final**: The post shows clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but lacks planning/preparation. This aligns with **Ideation**.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now. The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die and I'm scared of the emptiness after death that all I can do is cry myself to sleep and hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time. It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""killing myself"" and fear preventing action.  
   - Strong emotional indicators: ""hate,"" ""scared to die,"" ""cry myself to sleep,"" ""neverending cycle,"" ""I'm done.""  
   - Describes a desire to die (""hope that I don't wake up"") but conflict due to fear.  
   - References parents removing means (""taken any means they can think of""), but no specific plan/method/preparation stated by the author.  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) described; focuses on current internal struggle.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""killing myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses desire to die (""hope that I don't wake up"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted/distressing without desire; instead, fear is the barrier to acting on a genuine wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** mentioned. Parents removed means, but the author does not describe accessing new means or detailing a plan.  
   - ""I could do it right now"" implies capability but lacks concrete method/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses current/future intentions (""could do it right now"") but **no past/recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"" action).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""killing myself,"" ""hope I don't wake up"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/recent initiated lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no plan/method/preparation. Fear inhibits action, but the core intent remains.

302,"I want to die but I'm afraid of death. I want to kill myself. And the only thing keeping me alive is my fear of death. I know no one would miss me and I have nothing to live for, so there's literally no point in me being alive. I hate living with my family, My friendships are kinda failing. The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct desire for suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""no one would miss me,"" ""nothing to live for,"" ""no point in me being alive""), despair (""I hate living with my family,"" ""friendships are kinda failing""), and anhedonia. Fear of death and uncertainty about the afterlife are noted as barriers to action, but there is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings. There is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer expresses a genuine wish to die, tempered by fear, but does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or rejected.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and similar direct phrases like ""I want to die."" It expresses a clear desire to die, as seen in statements about wanting not to be alive. The writer does not negate or reject these thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The barriers (fear of death, uncertainty) are discussed, but there is no evidence of planning or preparation for suicide. Therefore, based on the rules, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, satisfying the 'Ideation' definition. However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, which would be required for 'Behavior'. The presence of fear as a barrier does not negate the expressed desire; it simply means no action is imminent. There is no ambiguity about suicidal intent (desire is explicit), so 'Indicator' is not appropriate. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

All I've done for the past few months is cause anguish and pain to those around me. I'm better off dead. Only 1 person left that cares. Can't stand this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being ""broken,"" gender dysphoria (""I'm a man, that feels like a woman, but could never be a woman""), hopelessness (""My being in itself is a prison""), being a burden (""cause anguish and pain to those around me""), and isolation (""Only 1 person left that cares""). It includes a statement related to death: ""I'm better off dead,"" which implies a desire to not be alive. However, there are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, guns, notes, or timelines like ""tonight""). The phrase ""Can't stand this anymore"" indicates despair but no imminent action. The desire expressed in ""I'm better off dead"" is not negated (e.g., the writer does not state that they don't want to act on these thoughts).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I'm better off dead"" expresses a clear desire to not be alive, which aligns with the definition of suicidal ideation. Since there is no explicit negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), it leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator.'

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated attempts, such as ""I tried to overdose""). This rules out 'Attempt.'

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""I'm better off dead"" constitutes an explicit personal desire to not be alive, fitting the 'Ideation' category. While there is general distress and hopelessness, the presence of this desire without any plan, method, or preparation distinguishes it from 'Behavior' and 'Attempt.' The lack of explicit negation (e.g., the writer does not reject the desire) also prevents it from being 'Indicator.' Per the rules, if there is ambiguity between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation,' 'Indicator' should be chosen, but here the desire is clear and personal, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

I've posted here so many times about how I set a date and then… I keep living past that date. Now my situation is no longer as desperate as it once was. It was extraordinarily painful, but what was hurting me is about to end. The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here. I came extraordinarily close to killing myself. As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions past suicidal intentions, including setting dates, writing letters, and having a specific plan that was ""days away"" from being executed. It explicitly references ""killing myself"" and describes preparations (letters written, plan set). However, the current state expresses a decision to live (""I made the decision to live""), hope (""light at the end of the tunnel""), and resolution that the painful situation is ending. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is detailed, but the plan was concrete enough for imminent action. The suicidal elements are historical, with no current desire, plan, or action indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and describes a past desire to die (""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself""). However, this desire is negated in the present by the author's stated decision to live, indicating the suicidal intent was historical and not current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, preparations are mentioned: ""letters were written"" and ""a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" This indicates concrete suicidal behavior (preparatory actions) in the past, even though no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is detailed. The presence of preparations leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past events (setting dates, writing letters, having a plan) but no initiated lethal action. Phrases like ""I was days away from going through with"" and ""I keep living past that date"" confirm that actions were planned and prepared for but not executed (e.g., no ingestion of pills, no actual attempt). Writing letters is preparatory, not an initiated suicidal act. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires a potentially lethal action to have been started.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a past explicit desire to die with a plan and preparations, fitting 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts/desire plus plan/preparation). However, there is no current suicidal desire or intent (author states they decided to live). The historical behavior is relevant, but the classification is based on the content described. Since no action was initiated, it is not 'Attempt'. The absence of current desire or plan rules out 'Ideation' for the present, but the detailed past behavior with preparations aligns with 'Behavior'. 'Indicator' is inappropriate because the author personally expressed past suicidal desire and concrete preparations, going beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses regret for not acting on suicidal thoughts in the past (""I'm angry at myself for not doing it years ago""), a recurring desire to not be alive since 2012 (""I've wished I wasn't alive and wanted things to be over fairly regularly""), and anger about societal perceptions of suicide. There are mentions of suicidal ideation (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" ""thought about it"") but no specific methods, plans, or preparations described. No references to past actions initiated, such as attempts that were stopped or failed. The language is reflective, focusing on past and ongoing feelings without indicating current imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is expressed as a regretful wish, but there is no indication of unwanted suicidal thoughts or resistance to acting on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly implies a personal desire to die through phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive"" and ""wanted things to be over,"" which convey a clear wish for death in a context of despair. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The post discusses thoughts and regrets but lacks concrete details about how suicide might be carried out. Since there is a desire to die but no plan or preparation, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past and recurring suicidal thoughts since 2012, with no reference to any initiated actions. Phrases like ""not doing it"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" indicate contemplation without action. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal past action (e.g., an attempt that was interrupted or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal suicidal desire (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive""), fitting 'Ideation'. However, there is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. While the post expresses distress, the clear personal desire for death means it does not fit 'Indicator', which requires ambiguity about suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts. Thus, 'Ideation' is the appropriate category.

I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions being ""depressed and suicidal,"" having a ""written a note"" with specific instructions for possessions, and recurring thoughts about administrative tasks (canceling things) to avoid burdening family. It expresses a desire to die (""wanting to die,"" ""ready to die"") but highlights that administrative concerns prevent action. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or past initiated suicidal actions. The note preparation is a clear step taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""wanting to die,"" indicating a genuine personal desire to die. The writer does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are conflicted by practical barriers (administrative tasks), but the underlying desire remains.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is mentioned. However, there is explicit preparation: ""written a note that also includes what I want each person to receive."" This constitutes a suicide-related preparation, as defined in the Behavior category (e.g., ""writing my suicide note"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past preparation (writing the note) and recurring thoughts of readiness (""times where I just get ready to die""), but no description of a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., taking pills, jumping). Writing a note is preparatory, not an attempt, so it does not qualify as an Attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die rules out Indicator. The presence of preparation (written suicide note) elevates it beyond Ideation to Behavior, as per the definition: ""mentions preparations being taken"" (e.g., writing a suicide note). There is no indication of a past or recent initiated lethal action, so Attempt does not apply. The lack of a specific method is noted, but preparation alone suffices for Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes a stressful event (trespassing due to conflict with a friend), resulting in family trouble and legal risk.  
   - Key emotional indicator: ""I've never been more suicidal in my life"" expresses intense current suicidal feelings.  
   - **No mention** of death/dying methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. Only references the *intensity* of suicidal thoughts.  
   - The phrase ""suicidal"" is personal and current but lacks any detail about desire, method, plan, or action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""I've never been more suicidal in my life"" explicitly references suicidal thoughts from the author.  
   - The author does **not** state these thoughts are unwanted or express a wish to resist them (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines).  
   - The focus is solely on the *intensity* of suicidal feelings triggered by recent events.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal feeling (""never been more suicidal"") is described as current (""in my life"") but **no past or recent suicidal actions** are mentioned (e.g., no overdose, self-harm, or interrupted attempt).  
   - The ""fucked up"" event refers to trespassing, not a suicide-related behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present (""suicidal""), placing it above *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is indicated, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of a past/recent initiated suicidal action** (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills""), ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is a **current expression of intense suicidal thoughts without further specificity**, fitting *Ideation*.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction with Australia, comparing it to Auschwitz and describing it as a prison colony and fascist regime. Key elements include feelings of oppression, lack of freedom, and being controlled, with references to historical atrocities (Hitler, purification of the human race).
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The focus is on societal and political criticism, not personal experiences or intentions.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no freedom,"" ""illusion of freedom,"" ""slaves"") and despair, but these are directed at external circumstances, not internal personal states.
   - No references to specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for self-harm.
   - No discussion of past actions related to suicide or self-harm.
   - The writer's distress is about societal issues, with no expressed desire for personal death or suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear personal expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent).
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, there is no indication of unwanted thoughts or negation. The content is entirely about external societal problems.
   - Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means).
   - Without any suicidal desire expressed, this category is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current societal situation, not personal past, present, or future actions.
   - No description of any initiated self-harm action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"" statements).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and despair about society, but lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt.
   - This fits 'Indicator' because the distress is abstract and societal, with no indication of the author's personal suicidal ideation or behavior. If there were any ambiguity (e.g., vague hopelessness), 'Indicator' would be chosen, but here the lack of personal suicidal content is clear.
   - Rules applied: Focus is solely on the author; no suicide-related content places this firmly in 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus"" – explicit desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: profound hopelessness (""I feel so alone""), worthlessness (""nobody seems to think about me""), despair (""it just hurts so much"").
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""after college""), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - No references to past actions/attempts.
   - Desire to die is explicit and framed as a solution (""be with Jesus"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""I just want to die"" (Yes).
   - Clear desire to not be alive: ""go to Heaven and be with Jesus"" (Yes).
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). The desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned (No).
   - Heaven/Jesus is a spiritual outcome, not a method (e.g., no implied overdose, jumping, etc.).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Expresses current/future desire (""I just want to die"") but no description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried last week"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""I just want to die"") confirms **Ideation**.
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No past/initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.
   - Strong distress and desire for death distinguish this from **Indicator** (where suicidal desire is absent/unwanted).

I have this hoplessness feeling like i'm stuck inside of a nightmare but i don't wake up and ugh. i'm sorry but right now i'm considering suicide because i can't fucking take it anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""hopelessness feeling""), despair (""Life is worse than death""), and feelings of being unloved or unsupported (family issues). It explicitly mentions ""considering suicide"" due to an inability to cope (""i can't fucking take it anymore"").
   - Mentions of suicide: Yes, ""considering suicide"" is a direct reference.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, isolation, and despair are present, but no specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, notes, or descriptions of initiated suicidal acts).
   - Imminence: The phrase ""right now"" indicates current consideration, but no specific timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire: The writer states they are ""considering suicide,"" which implies a current personal thought about suicide, but it does not explicitly negate or state the thoughts as unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit mention: Yes, ""suicide"" is directly stated.
   - Clear desire to die: The phrase ""considering suicide"" expresses a personal thought about ending life, driven by distress. It is not abstract or unwanted; it reflects a genuine consideration due to overwhelming feelings.
   - Unwanted thoughts? No, there is no indication that the thoughts are resisted or undesired (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation', not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific method or plan: None mentioned. No references to means (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools).
   - Preparation signs: Absent. The focus is on emotional state and thoughts, not actionable steps.
   - Since there is explicit suicidal thought but no plan or preparation, this aligns with 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes current/future intention: The post is about present feelings and consideration (""right now i'm considering suicide"").
   - Past actions: No mention of any initiated suicidal acts (e.g., no reference to past attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""considering suicide"") with an implied desire to escape suffering, fitting 'Ideation'.
   - It lacks a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.
   - Emotional distress is present, but the explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond 'Indicator' (which would apply if suicide was only abstractly mentioned or if thoughts were explicitly unwanted).
   - No past actions, so 'Attempt' is not relevant.
   - Final category: 'Ideation' (suicidal thoughts/desire without plan or preparation).

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post is written by someone concerned about their friend's severe suicidal behavior and abusive home situation. Key elements:
   - The author states: ""I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back."" This is the only personal reference to the author's own mental state.
   - No explicit mention of death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions by the author.
   - The author expresses distress, fear, helplessness, and confusion about their friend's situation but does not elaborate on their own suicidal thoughts beyond the brief admission.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The author says ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which explicitly references suicidal thoughts. However:
     - There is **no expression of a personal desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to die"").
     - There is **no context** indicating whether these thoughts are unwanted or represent a current intent. The phrasing is passive and lacks elaboration.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No mention** of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations related to the author's own suicidal thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The author does **not describe** any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). The focus remains on their friend's experiences.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The phrase ""I'm suicidal myself"" indicates general distress or suicidal thoughts but lacks:
     - Explicit desire to die.
     - Plan/method/preparation.
     - Description of concrete actions.
   - Without evidence of desire, plan, or action, this falls under **Indicator** (general distress with abstract/unelaborated mention of suicidal thoughts). Ambiguity about genuine desire also leans toward Indicator per guidelines.

312,"Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains direct pleas: ""Just kill me,"" ""Please! Just end my life!"" and ""end my pain.""  
   - Key elements include explicit expressions of a desire for death (""end my life"") and intense emotional distress (""end my pain"").  
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The appeal is directed outward (""you""), not inward (self-action).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit desire to die is stated (""end my life,"" ""kill me"").  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; the tone is desperate but self-directed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No reference to methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Expresses a current desire for death but **no description of past or imminent self-initiated actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit personal desire to die places this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about intent).  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of concrete past actions rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits 'Ideation': Explicit desire to die with no plan/method.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly discusses suicide as a utilitarian choice (""utilitarian for me to end my own life"") and questions if it is the ""right decision.""  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""anger issues,"" ""caused hurt""), hopelessness (""numbers dwindle by the day""), and self-directed pain.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - The author describes internal conflict: a logical desire to die vs. a faint opposing voice (""cry for help""), but the core focus is justifying suicide.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; only abstract reasoning and current contemplation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" and framing suicide as a solution. The desire is personal and current (""I want to check I'm making the right decision"").  
   - The ""cry for help"" acknowledgment doesn’t negate the active desire to die; it highlights ambivalence but not rejection of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: The post discusses suicide conceptually (e.g., ""utilitarian perspective"") but never references a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent actions are described. The author only reflects on their logical reasoning and current mental state.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""end my own life"") and suicidal justification confirm **Ideation**. The lack of negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, so it cannot be Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past/current concrete actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""I'm so tired,"" ""won't ever be happy,"" ""everything is a chore,"" ""everyday is pressure.""
   - Explicitly references suicide: ""end it all if we don't want to be here"" and ""gun which would solve everything"" (method mention).
   - Expresses desire to not exist: ""if we don't want to be here.""
   - No preparation (e.g., note-writing) or past/current actions described. Method (gun) is mentioned but stated as inaccessible (""can't get hold of"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""end it all"" and ""don't want to be here"" show a personal desire to die. The gun reference contextualizes ""solve everything"" as suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Method mentioned**: Gun is cited as a solution but explicitly negated due to inaccessibility. No alternative plan, tools, or preparations described. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on *current* hopelessness and frustration over lack of options. No past/ongoing suicidal actions described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Desire to die is explicit** (""end it all,"" ""don't want to be here""), ruling out *Indicator*.
   - **No actionable plan/preparation**: Gun is hypothetical and unattainable; no steps toward alternatives. Thus, not *Behavior*.
   - **No past/recent lethal action**, ruling out *Attempt*.
   - Fits **Ideation**: Clear desire to die + suicidal thoughts, but no concrete plan or initiated action.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses significant distress, including feelings of hopelessness (""I feel like a failure""), despair (""I wish I could curl up and die""), and anhedonia (""It feels like an effort just to get up""). It explicitly mentions ""I wish I could die"" twice, contextualized as reactions to parental conflict. However, the writer also counters these feelings by highlighting protective factors (love for dogs, future plans, acknowledgment of parental love, medication benefits) and explicitly states no genuine desire to act (""I would worry about [my dogs] if I died""). No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""I wish I could die"" are present.  
   - However, the context shows these are hyperbolic expressions of distress (e.g., ""when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die""), not genuine desires to die. The writer negates intent by emphasizing attachments (dogs, parents) and future goals.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: None identified. The post lacks references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or any concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: No description of past or imminent suicidal actions. Distress is ongoing but theoretical.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal language is present but framed as unwanted, momentary reactions to stress, not persistent desire.  
   - Protective factors and lack of planning contradict active suicidal intent.  
   - Ambiguity between ""Indicator"" and ""Ideation"" is resolved by the writer’s explicit disavowal of genuine intent (e.g., worry about dogs, future plans).  
   - **Rule application**: When desire is negated or ambiguous, default to ""Indicator"".

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes intense self-disgust, shame, and distress related to porn addiction and a partner's infidelity.  
   - Explicitly states: ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself.""

   - No references to past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  
   - Emotional tone: Self-hatred, hopelessness, and disgust dominate.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""wanting to kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal desire.  
   - The writer does **not** negate this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal ideation is explicit, there is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  
   - Masturbating to the thought of suicide is a coping behavior, not a suicidal action or preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Refers to recent feelings (""recently I just felt disgusted"") but **no description of a past or current suicidal act**.  
   - The phrase ""ended up masturbating"" describes a non-suicidal action initiated in response to thoughts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""wanting to kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""gun,"" ""note"") → *Behavior* not applicable.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/recent potentially lethal action described → *Attempt* not applicable.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses a current, personal desire to die with explicit suicidal thoughts but lacks any plan or preparatory action → **Ideation**.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (""I never wished to be born""), isolation (""No one is really listening""), and burden themes (""force myself to continue living"").  
   - **Plan/method/preparation**: No mention of specific methods, tools, timelines, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, locations).  
   - **Temporal context**: Desires are generalized (e.g., ""when I end my life"") without immediacy (""tonight,"" ""soon""). No past actions described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions past self-harm (""cutting"") and a specific incident where the author cut themselves while their girlfriend was away.  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling ""numb and empty,"" crying oneself to sleep, hopelessness (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore""), and distress over invalidation (""faking it,"" ""attention seeker"").  
   - References to others encouraging the girlfriend to kill herself, but **no personal expression of suicidal intent or desire to die by the author**.  
   - No mention of suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past/current suicidal actions by the author. Self-harm (cutting) is described, but it is presented as a coping mechanism (""relieve some of the pain""), not a suicide attempt.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct desire to die by the author. The phrase ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" conveys hopelessness but not a stated wish to die.  
   - The only death-related content involves others telling the girlfriend to kill herself—**not the author's personal intent**.

   - The post expresses **distress, hopelessness, and invalidation** but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal intent, plan, or suicidal action.  
   - Self-harm is disclosed but is distinct from suicidal behavior (per the definitions).  
   - The ambiguous ""not worth it"" leans toward hopelessness (Indicator), not active suicidal desire (Ideation).  
   - **No evidence for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt**. Fits **Indicator** due to distress without explicit suicidal intent.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""acting on my suicidal thoughts,"" indicating personal engagement with suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""one hell of a depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse""), anhedonia (inability to use coping methods), and feeling unsupported (rejection from family/friends).
   - The author expresses a desire to avoid acting on suicidal thoughts (""I'd rather go to the hospital than act"") and explicitly states, ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point."" No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, location), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - Barriers to care (insurance, job obligations) are discussed, but no imminent timeline for suicidal action is indicated (e.g., ""wait for the 1st"" implies delay).
   - The suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted/distressing, with a stated preference for seeking help over acting.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""acting on my suicidal thoughts.""
   - **However**, the author explicitly states they *do not* want to act on these thoughts and prefer hospitalization. The desire expressed is to *avoid* suicide, not to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No** specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The focus is on *considering* hospitalization to *prevent* action, not on planning suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The post discusses *current* ideation and distress, with future-oriented concerns about worsening risk, but no initiated lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal references to suicidal thoughts (""suicidal ideation,"" ""acting on my suicidal thoughts"").
   - However, the author **explicitly negates the desire to act** on these thoughts and expresses a preference for help-seeking. The suicidal thoughts are presented as distressing but unwanted.
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - **No past or recent initiated lethal action** is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The combination of explicit suicidal thoughts **with a clear statement that they are unwanted and not intended for action** aligns best with 'Indicator' (distress about suicidal thoughts without a current personal desire to die).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Explicit desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead""). Mentions daily heroin use and forced institutionalization, but heroin is framed as current behavior, not explicitly as a suicide method. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Fuck that""), anger (""Fuck them! They will pay""), and feeling betrayed by family. No specific suicide plan/method (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump"") or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring tools). Past antipsychotic use is mentioned, but not as a suicide-related action. Temporal focus is future-oriented (""soon,"" ""within 4 weeks"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" express a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. Heroin use is described as a daily habit (""started to do heroin pretty much daily"") but not linked to a suicide plan (e.g., no ""I’ll overdose to end it""). No mention of specific tools, locations, or suicide preparations. Anger toward family implies intent for retribution, but not suicidal action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future desires (""I hope,"" ""Soon I will be dead""). Describes past antipsychotic use as distressing but **not** as a suicidal act. No initiated, interrupted, or failed suicidal actions described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (→ *Ideation* or higher), but **no plan/method/preparation** (rules out *Behavior*). **No past/current suicidal actions** (rules out *Attempt*). Heroin use is a risk factor but not framed as a suicide method, so it doesn’t elevate to *Behavior*. Strong emotional distress and future-oriented death wishes align with *Ideation*.

   - Mentions a specific method: using a gun to target the brain stem.  
   - Expresses disregard for deterrents (e.g., family impact, future regrets), indicating a genuine desire to die.  
   - No explicit references to past actions or preparations, but focuses on method effectiveness.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the query about lethal gun positioning implies a clear desire to die.  
   - Dismissal of reasons to live confirms a lack of ambivalence.  
   - **Result: Explicit desire to die is strongly implied (Yes)**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (gun) and anatomical target (brain stem) are mentioned.  
   - The question about ""best position"" indicates planning/research.  
   - **Result: Clear method and implicit planning (Yes)**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried""). Focus is on future intent.  
   - **Result: No evidence of an attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/plan = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: Method/plan is present (gun positioning).  
   - Distinction from Attempt: No initiated action described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts: ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse,"" invalidation by mother (""angry at me,"" ""dramatic""), and self-harm scars.
   - Mentions persistent, unwanted thoughts (""it wont leave my head"").
   - **No specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline** for suicide (e.g., no tools, location, or imminent action).
   - Self-harm scars indicate past self-injury but **no description of a past suicidal act** (self-harm ≠ suicide attempt).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing myself"" show personal desire/thoughts about suicide. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts** (""hasn't been a single day"") and past self-harm (scars), but **no concrete suicidal action** (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). Self-harm scars alone don’t qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""thought about killing myself"") with persistent thoughts, but **no plan/method/preparation**. Self-harm is noted but is distinct from suicidal behavior in this context. Falls under ""desire to not be alive"" without actionable steps.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense frustration (""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore""), hopelessness (""No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash""), and explicitly mentions suicide (""my only way out is killing myself"").  
   - Key phrases: ""killing myself"" (direct suicide mention), ""Let's just do it"" (immediate intent), ""I'm sick of life"" (desire to escape).  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or location is mentioned (e.g., pills, notes, timelines beyond ""let's just do it"").  
   - No past actions (e.g., ""I tried"") or descriptions of interrupted/failed attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""killing myself"" and reinforces intent with ""Let's just do it."" There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"")—only a clear desire to escape life.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While the phrase ""Let's just do it"" implies urgency, it lacks specifics about method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., ""I have a gun,"" ""taking pills tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intention** (""Let's just do it""). No past or recent concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"") are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""sick of life"") and active intent (""Let's just do it"") place this beyond **Indicator** (which lacks personal suicidal desire).  
   - The absence of a specific plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated action (e.g., swallowing pills) rules out **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** fits best: explicit personal desire to die/suicidal thoughts without a stated plan or method.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm going to attempt again"" (referring to suicide), past ""overdose three times,"" and ""first attempt at the beginning of this year.""
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I give up""), self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and perceived burdensomeness (""does that really matter if I don't love myself"").
   - Specific method: Overdosing (mentioned in past attempts).
   - Preparations/temporal context: Imminent action (""Just a few more hours""), resignation (""I am not fighting anymore""), and farewell (""Goodbye"").
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""I want to die,"" ""my mind has won"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. Phrases like ""attempt again,"" ""want to die,"" and ""my mind has won"" explicitly express a current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes. The imminent timeline (""few more hours"") signals preparation. Past methods (overdosing) are specified, reinforcing context for the upcoming action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **past potentially lethal actions**: Three overdoses and ""first attempt"" this year (concrete, initiated acts).
   - States **imminent future action**: ""I'm going to attempt again"" within hours.
   - The past actions meet the threshold for 'Attempt' (initiated, potentially lethal acts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes current suicidal intent and future plans (Behavior), **but the detailed description of past initiated, potentially lethal actions (overdoses) takes precedence** per the rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts [...] it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - The farewell (""Goodbye"") and immediacy (""few more hours"") heighten urgency but do not override the focus on past concrete actions.

And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes multiple sources of distress: separation from family, relationship strain, trauma (witnessing a friend's death and saving the killer), a mother's severe illness, a father being a pedophile, family estrangement, and alcoholism. 
   - Key phrase: ""I just want this pain to end."" This expresses a desire for relief from emotional pain but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore""), despair, and feeling overwhelmed, but no direct suicidal language. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present. 
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The desire is focused on ending pain, not on dying.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" implies distress and a wish for relief but does not express a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide. It is ambiguous and could refer to emotional escape rather than death. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no statement of them being unwanted or resisted. 
   - Leaning toward 'Indicator' due to lack of explicit suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. 
   - Without any plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post references past life events (e.g., friend drowning, family issues) but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an attempt, interrupted or otherwise). 
   - No indication of concrete suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and a desire for pain to end but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt. 
   - Ambiguity in ""I just want this pain to end"" suggests distress about life circumstances rather than an explicit wish to die. According to guidelines, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator'. 
   - No elements meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (plan/method), or 'Attempt' (initiated action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts. It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair, such as ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go,"" which suggest a desire to die. There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) described. The timeline ""this summer"" implies imminence but is not immediate. The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go."" There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses on admitting suicidal thoughts and a general intention, but lacks concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current/future intention (e.g., not expecting to survive the summer), but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no description of attempts, interruptions, or failures). The admission to the mother is a disclosure of feelings, not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die, falling under 'Ideation' due to the explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or preparation. It does not meet 'Indicator' because the desire is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted. It does not meet 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method. It does not meet 'Attempt' because no concrete, initiated actions are described. The ambiguity rule favors 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' when no plan is present.

I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work,"" ""I promise I won't fail this time,"" ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend,"" and ""I have heard hanging is painless.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme self-hatred (""I am trash,"" ""mentally disabled piece of shit""), hopelessness (""drowning in depression,"" ""no putting me back together""), and guilt/shame over past actions.  
   - Specific method: ""hanging"" is explicitly mentioned as the intended method.  
   - Preparation: Plans to ""buy the right stuff"" and ""say my goodbyes"" with a timeline (""after this weekend"").  
   - Past actions: ""I tried"" (past suicide attempts that failed).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""killed myself,"" ""I tried,"" ""I won’t fail this time,"" and ""gonna be gone."" The desire to die is unequivocal and personal.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. A specific method (""hanging"") is stated. Preparations include acquiring means (""buy the right stuff"") and farewells (""say my goodbyes""). A timeline (""after this weekend"") is also provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **past suicide attempts** (""I tried"") that were initiated but failed. It also describes **future plans** with specific preparations. The past actions were concrete (initiated but incomplete/failed attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a desire to die (*Ideation*), has a plan/method (*Behavior*), **and** references **past initiated actions** (""I tried"") that were potentially lethal.  
   - Per the rules: If a post describes past concrete suicide attempts (even if failed), **'Attempt' takes precedence** over current ideation/behavior. The statement ""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"" confirms a past *initiated action*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""killing myself"" (direct suicide reference).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""this life for me isn’t it""), worthlessness (""It’s not worth it""), and apology to others.  
   - Plan/method: Future-oriented (""at 30 or 25""), but **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** described (e.g., no pills, weapons, or notes).  
   - Temporal context: Distant timeline (""8 yrs or so""), with emphasis on rethinking decisions and seeking help. No past/current actions described.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""killing myself""), but framed conditionally on future feelings. No statement of *unwanted* thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and conditional desire to die (""if I still feel the same [...] Adios"").  

3. **PLAN/METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation**: Only vague timing (""at 30 or 25""), no actionable details (method, tools, or steps).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Future intention only (""planning,"" ""in 8 yrs""). No past/current initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (ruling out *Indicator*).  
   - No method/preparation mentioned (ruling out *Behavior*).  
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions (ruling out *Attempt*).  
   - Falls under *Ideation*: Explicit personal desire to die with future-oriented thoughts, but **no plan/method**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicide rate for men"" but in a statistical, observational context, not as a personal expression. The phrase ""teetering on the edge lately"" suggests emotional distress or being in a precarious state, but it is vague and metaphorical, not explicitly tied to suicide or self-harm. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators include feeling perceived as a threat and showing respect for others' struggles, but no personal hopelessness, despair, or burden is expressed. The focus is on societal issues (gender perception and suicide disparities) rather than the author's own suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit personal mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The reference to suicide rates is general and impersonal.
   - No clear personal desire to die or not be alive is expressed (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned as unwanted or present at all; the author discusses external statistics and empathy for others.
   - Leaning toward 'Indicator' as there is no personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. The content remains at the level of emotional/societal reflection.
   - Without any plan or method, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current emotional state (""been teetering on the edge lately"") and a realization about suicide rates, but no past, present, or future suicidal actions are described. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned.
   - Cannot be 'Attempt' as no concrete actions are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress about identity and societal perceptions, with a tangential reference to suicide statistics, but lacks any personal desire, plan, or action related to suicide. The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" is ambiguous but, without explicit suicidal context, aligns more with 'Indicator' (distress without personal suicidal intent). Since there is no clear expression of the author's own suicidal thoughts or desire to die, and ambiguity exists, 'Indicator' is the appropriate category per the rules (if in doubt between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator).

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly in the context of the mother's comment. The key element is the author's statement: ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which implies a personal risk of death or disappearance, likely by suicide. Emotional indicators include sarcasm (""Thanks mom""), despair (sad emoticon), and a farewell message (""Peace out all...""), suggesting hopelessness and a sense of finality. There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The temporal context is future-oriented (""within 24 hours""), indicating imminence, but no past actions are described. The author expresses a desire to be ""gone,"" which, in this context, implies a personal wish to die, without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (though initially in reference to the mother). More critically, the author personally expresses a desire to not be alive through ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which, combined with the farewell, conveys a clear suicidal intent in a context of despair. There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., ""but I don't want to""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied. The farewell (""Peace out all..."") could be interpreted as a goodbye, but it is not an explicit preparation (e.g., writing a note or gathering means). Without any clear plan, method, or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""within 24 hours"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed). Therefore, it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""gone within 24 hours"") with suicidal intent, falling under 'Ideation'. However, there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The absence of a concrete past action rules out 'Attempt'. The direct personal expression of suicidal thoughts distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which lacks such desire. Applying the rule: If no plan/method is present, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post details severe emotional distress stemming from ongoing parental abuse, manipulation, and feeling trapped. Key elements include:
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't have a choice""), despair (""it's killing me""), self-blame (""I hate myself""), and helplessness.
   - Metaphorical language: ""it's killing me"" expresses intense suffering but is not literal.
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.
   - Focus is on a desire for safety/escape (restraining order, moving out), not a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""
   - ""It's killing me"" is idiomatic distress; no genuine wish to die is expressed.
   - **Conclusion**: No suicidal intent (Leans 'Indicator').

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No references to suicide plans, methods (pills, weapons), preparations (notes), or locations.
   - Mentions legal/escape plans (restraining order), not self-harm.
   - **Conclusion**: Absence supports 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes past abuse and manipulation, but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions.
   - No references to attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm.
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of 'Attempt' or imminent risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and helplessness but lacks personal desire for death/suicide.
   - Metaphorical language (""killing me"") indicates suffering, not intent.
   - All content aligns with seeking relief/safety, not ending life.

   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won’t end badly"") and guilt over broken promises.  
   - No specific plan/method (e.g., pills, location) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) described for suicide.  
   - Self-harm is mentioned as a current behavior, but it is distinct from a suicidal act.  
   - Temporal context: Suicidal statements reflect future intent (""a matter of time,"" ""should do it now""), not a past/initiated action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""I should do it now"" show a clear, personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: While self-harm is occurring, it is not framed as a suicidal method. No tools, locations, or suicide-specific preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Self-harm is current but non-lethal; suicidal intent is future-oriented. No description of a past/recent *initiated suicidal act* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation is specified. Self-harm alone does not equate to a suicide plan.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated suicidal action (past or recent) described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets 'Ideation' criteria—explicit desire to die without a plan.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""im fucking done""), self-loathing (""what people would think if they saw the real fucking me""), guilt (""i fucking deserve death""), and exhaustion (""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people"").  
   - A specific method is implied (""blow my head off,"" likely referring to a firearm), but there is **no indication of preparation** (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) or a **personal plan to act**. The phrase ""please kill me"" is a plea for others to act, not a self-initiated plan.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described.  
   - Temporal context is present-focused (""im fucking done,"" ""please kill me"") but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer expresses a **genuine desire to die** (""deserve death,"" ""please kill me"") without disclaiming the thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, direct phrases include ""blow my head off,"" ""deserve death,"" and ""please kill me.""  
   - Yes, a clear desire to die is expressed (e.g., ""i fucking deserve death"").  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts; the writer endorses the desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned but only in the context of a plea for someone else to act. **No personal plan, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., ""I have a gun,"" ""I will do it at X place"") are described by the author for self-action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current distress and desire but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., no mention of self-initiated overdose, cutting, or interrupted attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal intent is explicit (desire to die), so not 'Indicator'.  
   - No specific plan/preparation for self-action (the method is tied to a plea for others), so not 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of past/initiated lethal actions, so not 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits 'Ideation': explicit desire to die (""deserve death,"" ""please kill me"") with no evidence of personal planning or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent: ""my only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have no plan post graduation,"" ""it won't work out long term"") and perceived burden (""my family would have a temporary grieving process"").  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., tools, substances) or **preparations** (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""if I ended my life right now""), with **no description of past/initiated actions**.  
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (""I ended my life""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" directly express a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal intent is clear, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, location, or preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No past/recent action**: The post discusses hypothetical suicide (""if I ended my life"") but describes no initiated or completed self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The author explicitly expresses a desire to die and suicidal intent but provides no details about a plan, method, or preparations. The absence of these elements rules out ""Behavior."" The hypothetical framing (""if I ended"") and lack of past actions rule out ""Attempt."" The clear desire to die distinguishes this from ""Indicator.""

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense hopelessness and self-loathing (e.g., ""Why was I born,"" ""I've been a failure,"" ""I despise myself""). It explicitly mentions suicidal actions: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and a specific recent event: ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers... hoped I wouldn't wake up."" There is a clear desire to die (""I want to die"") and a specific method (overdose on pills). The actions are recent (""yesterday,"" ""in the last 4 days"") and initiated by the author, though they failed. There is no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, the author acted on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related phrases (""end it all,"" ""I want to die"") and expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., hoping not to wake up after taking pills). There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers""), which constitutes a plan and preparation. This indicates behavior but is tied to a past action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author (""yesterday I took...""). The action failed (""but here I am""), but it was concrete and self-initiated. Another reference to ""failed twice in the last 4 days"" reinforces multiple past actions. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, as it involves initiated lethal behavior, even if unsuccessful.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of a method and preparation could suggest 'Behavior', but the key factor is the description of a past, initiated lethal action (taking pills). Per the guidelines, if a post describes a concrete, potentially lethal past action, it should be classified as 'Attempt', even if current ideation is present. The action here is recent, specific, and potentially life-threatening, so 'Attempt' takes precedence over 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

Hard work and all the rest can make some improvements on the margins but luck is the core determinant",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being cursed or victimized (e.g., ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse,"" ""I have nothing""). It details life struggles such as unfair treatment, bullying, family rejection, cultural pressures, and societal issues. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include despair (e.g., ""My life sucks solely because of factors outside of my control""), anhedonia (implied in dissatisfaction with life), and feeling unsupported, but no explicit desire to die. There are no references to plans, preparations, past suicidal actions, or imminent intentions. The writer's stated desire is focused on venting frustration and seeking validation, not on ending life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It does not express a clear personal desire to die or not be alive (e.g., no statements like ""I want to be gone""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no context where they are described as unwanted. Since suicide/death is not referenced, this strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. The content is about life circumstances and emotional pain, not planning or acting on suicidal thoughts. Without any such elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior' or higher.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past and ongoing life difficulties (e.g., bullying, family issues) but no past or recent suicidal actions. There is no indication of any initiated, potentially lethal self-harm event. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions. This fits 'Indicator', which covers general distress without current suicidal intent. There is no ambiguity suggesting 'Ideation' (which requires a desire to die) or higher categories. Following the rule to choose 'Indicator' if in doubt or when suicidal desire is absent, this is the appropriate classification.

337,"I'm feeling suicidal about my parents getting to know about me drinking and smoking. Yesterday I was caught in my dorm room for possession of 2crates of empty alcohol bottles and 10gm pack of weed. Note: both are prohibited in my dorm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and feeling like ""a burden.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""only escape to this situation is suicide"") and despair due to panic attacks and insomnia.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation (e.g., pills, location, note-writing) is mentioned.  
   - No description of past/current actions initiated toward suicide (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  
   - Focus is on *fear of consequences* and escalating suicidal ideation, with desire to die implied as an escape.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""the only escape [...] is suicide,"" indicating personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicide is framed as an escape, no method, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts and distress but **no past/ongoing self-initiated lethal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""escape is suicide"") and suicidal thoughts are present, but **no plan/method/preparation** is indicated. The absence of concrete behavioral steps (e.g., ""I have pills"") rules out 'Behavior'. No past action qualifies for 'Attempt'. Distress alone doesn’t override explicit suicidal intent, so 'Indicator' is too low.

I have been through SO MUCH and even just one thing is so twisted and brutal that .my whole story is just too much for anyone to hear . I really don't think I have anyone except my two friends I have known for a decade . One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted.and my mom, I also have my mom.

I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks. But when I see it, I panic and jump away and start crying. Help?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, including ""end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""attempted,"" and specific methods like ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I really am up against a wall""), despair (""my whole story is just too much""), and feelings of being a burden (""I do not want to hurt the few people who love me""). Specific plans and methods are detailed, such as the intent to use a train (""I know the way I will end it,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and knowledge of the train schedule due to proximity to the tracks. Preparations are implied through repeated visits to the tracks. References to past actions include ""the times I have tried"" and a specific past attempt where 911 was called (""the first time I actually attempted""). Recent actions are described, such as going to the tracks, seeing the train approach, and jumping away at the last minute (""fight or flight kicks in and I jump away""). Imminence is indicated by current struggles (""I am left wanting to jump,"" ""How do I stay on the tracks?""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die but with ambivalence due to fear (""I really do not want to do this,"" but ""this is all I have left"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide ideation"" and ""attempted,"" and phrases like ""end it,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" and ""how to stay on the tracks"" convey a clear, personal desire to die. The writer's ambivalence (""I really do not want to do this"") is about the act of suicide due to fear, not a negation of the desire to die, as they seek ways to overcome this fear. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink""), and there are signs of preparation, such as knowing the train schedule and repeated visits to the tracks with intent. The writer's actions (e.g., going to the tracks and jumping away at the last minute) indicate engagement with the method, leaning toward 'Behavior'. However, the presence of initiated actions (discussed below) shifts this to 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes both past and very recent actions. Past events include multiple ""tried"" attempts and one concrete, potentially lethal attempt (""the first time I actually attempted"") that required intervention (911 called). Recent actions involve going to the tracks, seeing the train approach, and initiating an act by being in a potentially lethal position but jumping away due to panic (""I jump away at the last minute""). These are described as self-initiated, potentially lethal actions that were interrupted by the writer themselves, fitting the 'Attempt' definition.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The writer expresses a desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator') and has a specific plan/method (ruling out 'Ideation'). While 'Behavior' could apply due to the plan and preparations, the key element is the description of past and very recent initiated actions (""tried,"" ""actually attempted,"" and recurring visits to the tracks with intent to jump) that were potentially lethal but interrupted. This meets the 'Attempt' criteria: concrete, self-initiated actions, even if aborted or failed. The rule that ""if a post refers to past attempts and current ideation, label 'Attempt' if past actions are clearly described"" applies here. The current distress and plans do not override the precedence of the initiated actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions feelings of being a burden (""People tell me I'm a burden"") and describes a life situation characterized by isolation, lack of productivity, and hopelessness (e.g., ""I haven't left the house since I was 14,"" ""I lay in bed all day""). There are no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are implied through the description of the author's circumstances, but there is no expression of a desire to die. No plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or imminent intentions related to suicide are present. The focus is on distress and life difficulties, not on suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar phrases. No clear desire to die is expressed (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The content centers on feelings of being a burden and life struggles, with no indication of suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted. Therefore, this aspect strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post lacks any elements of planning or concrete steps toward suicide, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes an ongoing life situation with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). There is no indication of any initiated lethal behavior, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden, which aligns with 'Indicator' (distress without personal suicidal desire or intent). There is no evidence of suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions, so it does not qualify for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. As per the rules, if there is ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen, but here there is no ambiguity—the content is clearly non-suicidal in intent.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""Things aren't getting better,"" ""I don't have much to live for""), despair, isolation, and a history of trauma (bullying, familial neglect).  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" and ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life.""  
   - A **specific method** (""stick some knives through my stomach"") and **timeline** (""graduation night"") are mentioned.  
   - No description of past/ongoing suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm). Preparations (e.g., acquiring knives) are not described.  
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication the thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""stick some knives through my stomach.""  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""be done with life"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted/distressing intrusions; they reflect active intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A specific method (""stick knives through my stomach"") and timeframe (""graduation night"") are stated.  
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., obtaining knives) are described, but the specificity of method and timing constitutes a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intent** (""I can kill myself on graduation night"").  
   - **No** mention of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to prior suicide attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent go beyond general distress.  
   - **Ideation?** No: While suicidal desire is present, the specificity of method (""knives"") and timeline (""graduation night"") elevates it beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Behavior?** **Yes**: The combination of explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") with a stated method (stabbing with knives) and timeframe (graduation night) fits ""Behavior.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""researching tall bridges"" (implying a method for suicide), ""commit when I get home"" (explicit future suicidal intent), ""I have a few methods to try"" (specific methods), and ""I've already drafted my suicide notes"" (preparation). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway"") and despair (""I can't anymore"").
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""commit"" (contextually means commit suicide) and ""suicide notes"" are explicit references.
   - Specific plans/methods: Researching bridges, multiple methods planned, and drafting notes indicate concrete planning and preparation.
   - Past actions: Drafting suicide notes is a preparatory action, but no description of an initiated lethal act (e.g., taking pills or jumping).
   - Imminence: The plan is deferred (""commit when i get home""), so not immediate, but specific.
   - Stated desire: Clear desire to die with no indication of unwanted thoughts (e.g., ""It's settled"" shows resolve).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, ""suicide notes"" explicitly references suicide, and ""commit"" in context confirms a desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").

   - Yes, specific methods (tall bridges, ""a few methods to try"") and preparations (drafted suicide notes) are mentioned, indicating planning beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past preparatory actions (researching, drafting notes) and future intent (""commit when i get home""). No initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of a past or recent attempt like taking pills or jumping), so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die with explicit suicidal intent, moving this beyond 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of specific methods (bridges, other methods) and preparations (drafted notes) means this is not just 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).
   - Since no concrete, initiated lethal action is described (only planning and preparation), it does not meet the 'Attempt' criteria.
   - This fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal desire, stated plans, methods, and preparations.

342,"I'm free. It looks like I'm finally free to end it all. For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself because I had to ""stay alive for"" my friends. Well, I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore. Looks like I'm finally free to commit lifen't. This is a blessing. Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all. Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Explicit mentions of ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't"" (euphemism for suicide), and ""wish you all a farewell.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Relief (""I'm free,"" ""a weight off my chest,"" ""blessing""), hopelessness (""don’t have anyone worth staying alive for""), and ambivalence (""possibility I’ll opt not to go through with it"").  
   - Plans/preparations: References ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and future decision-making (""once I’m ready... I’ll make my decision""). No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or concrete preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.  
   - Imminence: Future-oriented (""once I’m ready,"" ""could finally be my time""), not immediate.  
   - Desire: Explicitly states a wish to die (""free to end it all""), but acknowledges potential hesitation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" and ""commit lifen’t."" The desire to die is personal and current (""I’m finally free to...""). Ambivalence (""possibility I’ll opt not to"") does not negate the primary desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: ""Looking into options"" and ""getting my ducks in a row"" imply general preparation but lack concrete details (e.g., specific tools, locations, or actions). The language is abstract and exploratory, not actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intentions** only. No mention of past/current actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took steps"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die confirms **Ideation** (not Indicator).  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods means it does not meet **Behavior** criteria (""looking into options"" is too vague; no tools/locations).  
   - No initiated actions, so **Attempt** is ruled out.  
   - Ambivalence about acting does not override the explicit suicidal desire.

'Get a therapist' yeah when you're constantly suicidal, helping yourself isn't really much of an option you consider. How the fuck am I supposed to develop some positive outlook from a therapy office when I am not even in the proper perspective? It's all bullshit. People like me are sick. I should be allowed assisted suicide. It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post contains explicit phrases like ""I want to kill myself,"" ""Wow I need to kill myself,"" and ""constantly suicidal,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't just go from... overnight""), frustration with therapy, and feeling trapped (""stay and suffer"").  
   - Mentions ""assisted suicide"" as a wish but **no specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or imminent timeline).  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct statements (""want to kill myself,"" ""need to kill myself"") express a current, personal desire to die.  
   - **No**: The writer does not negate or reject these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **No**: ""Assisted suicide"" is a general concept, not a concrete personal plan/method. No tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Focuses on **current/future** distress and ideation. **No past/recent initiated lethal actions** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts (""constantly suicidal"") are present, but **no plan/method/preparation** is indicated. ""Assisted suicide"" is a wish, not actionable planning.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No specific method/preparation.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No described past/recent actions.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (not abstract/unwanted thoughts).

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end myself soon,"" indicating suicidal intent and a sense of imminence. It specifies a method (overdosing) and means (1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac), showing preparation by having the substances. There are no references to past actions; the focus is on future intent. The language conveys a direct desire to die without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""end myself"" is a direct phrase equivalent to ""kill myself,"" expressing a clear desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") to suggest the thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (overdosing) and means (Benadryl and Prozac) are mentioned. The phrase ""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"" confirms preparation (possession of the substances). This satisfies the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""soon"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is not describing an attempt that has already occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a method (overdose) and preparation (having the drugs) moves it beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. Since no initiated action is described, it is not 'Attempt'. The specificity of the method and means means 'Behavior' is appropriate.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions past self-harm actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This indicates initiated but non-lethal/aborted actions.
   - Expresses explicit desire to die: ""I feel like I just need to do it [suicide].""
   - References a specific method (knife/cutting) and vivid imagery of death (""imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood"").
   - Emotional indicators: loneliness, perceived burden (""inconvenience""), hopelessness, and self-criticism (""coward"").
   - No explicit current plan/preparations (e.g., no stated intent to act *now*).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. Phrases like ""I feel like I just need to do it"" (referring to suicide) and ""imagine my family seeing me dead"" show a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. A specific method (knife to wrist) is mentioned in the context of past actions, and death imagery (""pool of blood"") reinforces this method. No *current* preparations are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **past actions**: Three instances of initiating self-harm with a knife (aborted before injury). These are concrete, potentially lethal actions that were stopped by the author (""couldn't cut"").  
   - Expresses **current ideation**: Desire to act (""need to do it"") but no description of imminent or future action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The **past actions** (initiating knife use) qualify as an 'Attempt' under the definition: ""specific, self-initiated actions... potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self.""  
   - Current content includes suicidal ideation and method references, but the **past attempt takes precedence** per the rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - The self-criticism (""coward for not going through with it"") confirms the actions were intentional and lethal in intent.  
   - Ruled out 'Behavior' because the method mention is tied to past actions, not current planning.  
   - Ruled out 'Ideation'/'Indicator' due to explicit past suicidal actions and current desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses guilt (""done fucked up stuff,"" ""not a good person"") and a deep need for love/acceptance.  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is stated: ""before I kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness about being loved (""is that possible?"", ""any hope"").

   - **No past actions** described (e.g., no mention of prior attempts or initiated self-harm).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

   - Describes a **future intention** (""before I kill myself"") but **no past/recent initiated lethal action**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**

   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., *how* they would kill themselves).

Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep hopelessness (""life will be filled with misery and pain""), despair (""I feel unwanted""), anhedonia (""not motivated to do anything""), and social isolation (""none of my friends like me"").  
   - **Explicit mention**: ""the thought of suicide"" is directly stated, framed as an unfixable problem (""You can’t fix that shit"").  
   - **No plan/method/preparation**: No mention of tools, locations, timing, or concrete steps (e.g., pills, notes).  
   - **No past action**: No description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts.  
   - **Desire assessment**: The author references suicidal thoughts but does *not* explicitly state a current desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"") or negate the thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts""). The tone emphasizes helplessness about the thoughts, not intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Explicit mention?** Yes (""suicide"").  
   - **Desire to die?** No. The phrase ""the thought of suicide"" implies ideation but lacks a personal wish (e.g., ""I want to act on this"").  
   - **Unwanted thoughts?** Not explicitly stated. The focus is on the *inescapability* of the thoughts, not rejection of them.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Method/preparation?** No. No tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Past action?** No reference to past suicide attempts or self-harm.  
   - **Current/future intent?** The suicidal thoughts are described as a present struggle, but no imminent plan or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit mention of ""suicide"" and personal struggle with the thought elevates it beyond general distress (**Indicator**).  
   - However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The core is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts without actionable intent, fitting **Ideation**.

It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past depression, anxiety, loneliness during lockdown.  
   - Explicitly references suicidal thoughts (""what if I wasn’t in this world,"" ""gain peace"").  
   - **Crucially states these thoughts were unwanted and frightening**: ""These thoughts scared me,"" ""on the verge of becoming suicidal,"" and ""Never really thought I would act it out.""  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline mentioned.  
   - Focuses on recovery/advice (""Life can be very beautiful,"" recommends a book for others).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but **explicitly negated as unwanted** and not actionable. The writer emphasizes fear and lack of intent to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No tools, locations, preparations, or specific plans described.

   - Fits **Indicator**: Unwanted suicidal thoughts without genuine desire to die, focus on abstract distress/past experience, and no plan/action.  
   - *Not Ideation*: No current/personal desire to die expressed; thoughts are framed as frightening and historical.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end myself"" and ""end it,"" which are direct references to suicide. It specifies a method (""overdose"") and imminence (""tonight""). The word ""again"" suggests a history of similar thoughts or actions, but the current focus is on future intent. Emotional indicators include depression, sadness, crying, and helplessness (""idk what to do"").
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""end myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die through statements like ""I think I'm gonna try to end myself again tonight."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the language conveys intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""overdose""), and it is tied to the imminent plan (""tonight""). While no explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, the mention of a method in the context of intent qualifies this element.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no description of a past or recent initiated action. The word ""again"" references past events but does not detail a concrete, potentially lethal action that was carried out; it only implies recurrence of ideation or behavior. Thus, the content is forward-looking.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method (overdose) place this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire) or 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). It fits 'Behavior' due to the stated plan and method for a future action. It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described—only intent for the future.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I can't fight anymore""), emotional exhaustion (""so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders""), and a belief that the author is ""at the end.""  
   - It explicitly links death to relief: ""My death will release my pain and my tortured soul.""  
   - A timeline is implied (""in the next month or two""), but **no specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes, goodbyes) are mentioned.  
   - The author states they feel destined to die (""Some people just aren’t meant for this world"") but does not describe any past or current suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""My death will release my pain"" and ""I know I’m at the end"" convey a **personal desire to die** as relief from suffering. The metaphor of a dying cat reinforces acceptance of imminent death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While a vague timeline (""next month or two"") is given, there is **no mention of a method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., ""I have pills,"" ""going to the bridge"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **future intentions** (""coming to an end in the next month or two"") but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits best:  
     - There is an explicit **desire to die** (""My death will release my pain"") and **suicidal thoughts** (""I know I’m at the end"").  
     - **No plan/method/preparation** is indicated, ruling out ""Behavior.""  
     - **No description of past/current actions** (e.g., taking pills), ruling out ""Attempt.""  
     - The emotional distress is paired with **personal suicidal intent**, ruling out ""Indicator.""

I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year .

   - Expresses explicit desire to die (""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I'm ready to do it"").
   - Indicates imminent action (""about to lock myself in,"" ""currently 6 in the morning"").
   - Shows emotional distress (hopelessness, shame, feeling like a failure) but also explicit intent.
   - No past actions described—only current/future plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I'm ready to do it,"" and ""run out of options"" confirm personal desire to die.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method → **Behavior**.

As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day,"" indicating persistent suicidal ideation and frequent consideration of suicide methods.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no interest in modern life,"" ""each year has got worse,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"").  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are described; ""contemplate method"" is vague and general.  
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the thoughts are ongoing but not time-bound.  
   - The writer expresses distress about the thoughts (""what's really worrying"") but does not explicitly state that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they lack a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method,"" indicating a personal desire to die or engage in suicidal behavior.  
   - No explicit negation of the desire (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") is present; the focus is on the persistence of thoughts, not rejection of them.  
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' or possibly 'Behavior' due to method contemplation, but the lack of specificity keeps it closer to explicit ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - ""Contemplate method"" suggests thinking about methods but does not specify any concrete plan, tool, substance, location, or preparation.  
   - No evidence of actionable steps (e.g., ""I have pills"" or ""going to the bridge"").  
   - Since the method is only contemplated and not described explicitly, this aligns with 'Ideation' (thoughts without a plan) rather than 'Behavior' (which requires explicit planning elements).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current, ongoing thoughts (""constantly,"" ""each day"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").
   - No indication of a concrete, lethal action having been started; all references are to thoughts and contemplation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplate method"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires lack of personal desire or explicit negation).  
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""contemplate method"" is vague and not actionable).  
   - No described past or recent actions disqualify 'Attempt'.  
   - The core of the post is suicidal ideation with a stated desire to die but no concrete plan, fitting 'Ideation'.  
   - Rule application: When unsure about plan/method specificity, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness (""I feel so trapped,"" ""I know no one can save me""), despair, and being a burden (""my mom expresses she is hurt...how dare her daughter betrays her""). It explicitly mentions a desire to die: ""I jsut want to die."" There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., ""I will do it tonight""), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past suicidal actions. The focus is on the user's traumatic experiences (e.g., sexual assault, family dynamics) and current emotional state, but no indication of imminent action or concrete steps toward suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states a personal desire to die: ""I jsut want to die."" This is a clear expression of suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, it goes beyond general distress and indicates active suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The desire to die is present, but there is no discussion of how, when, or where it might be carried out. The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past traumatic events (e.g., sexual assault, family conflicts) but no past or recent suicidal actions. Phrases like ""I jsut want to die"" refer to current feelings, not initiated actions. There is no description of an attempt (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I jsut want to die"") confirms suicidal ideation, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which would apply if there were only general distress without personal suicidal desire). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. With no evidence of a past or recent suicidal action, 'Attempt' is not relevant. Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation'.

354,I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a fuck up who can never get anything right. I feel like my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being who can't think for herself. I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out. I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of worthlessness (""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being"") and hopelessness. It explicitly mentions a suicidal method: ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which is a specific, potentially lethal means. The user is currently contemplating this action (""sitting in my car right now""). There is ambivalence about seeking help (""I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up""), but no explicit negation of suicidal desire or mention of unwanted thoughts. No past actions (e.g., attempts) or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" strongly implies a desire to die, as this is a common euphemism for suicide. While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" isn't used directly, the context of despair makes the intent clear. The user does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they don't want to die; instead, the conflict is about consequences of seeking help. Thus, there is a genuine suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which involves a tool (car) and location (implied by ""tree""). This constitutes a plan, even though it's contemplative (""thinking of"") rather than actively in progress. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the method itself is explicit, meeting the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current thoughts (""right now thinking of"") and future intentions, with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did""). The scenario is hypothetical and not an action that has been carried out.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts with a specific method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire to die) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). Since no concrete action was initiated, it doesn't meet 'Attempt' criteria. The mention of a method aligns with 'Behavior', as the user describes a plan in the context of current suicidal desire.

We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/dying: References mother's terminal cancer and personal fear of ""joining her"" after death.  
   - Emotional indicators: Intense guilt (""hate myself so much""), hopelessness (""dont see any future""), burden (""leaving my little brother""), and despair.  
   - Suicide-specific: Explicitly states ""struggled with suicide before"" (past hospitalization) and current fear ""I will be joining her as well"" + ""pain I will cause with my passing.""  
   - Imminence: Tied to mother's death (""final couple of weeks"").  
   - Desire: Actively expresses wish to die (""joining her,"" ""my passing"") without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""I will be joining her as well"" and ""pain I will cause with my passing"" directly convey a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) mentioned.  
   - Past hospitalization for suicide is referenced, but no *current* plan or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past: Hospitalization indicates prior suicidal behavior, but the post doesn’t describe a concrete past *action* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  
   - Current/Future: Expresses intent to die after mother’s passing but no initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die (""joining her"").  
   - **Behavior**: Ruled out—no plan, method, or preparation mentioned.  
   - **Attempt**: Past hospitalization *suggests* prior behavior but lacks details of a concrete, self-initiated lethal action in this post. The focus is on current/future intent.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits best—clear desire to die (""I will be joining her"") and hopelessness, but absent specific plans or imminent actions.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes intense emotional distress following a breakup, including feelings of hopelessness (""I feel so weak, so hopeless""), despair (""Nothing, nothing changes""), and exhaustion (""I wake up even more tired of living""). Key phrases like ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" suggest a sense of urgency or impending action, but there are **no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means**. The phrase ""stop it"" is vague and could refer to ending emotional pain rather than life. No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring tools) or past actions (e.g., prior attempts) are described. The author expresses distress about intrusive thoughts and dreams but does not frame them as a genuine desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent appear.
   - The statement ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"" lacks clarity about a desire to die; it could imply ending suffering non-lethally (e.g., drastic life changes). The author focuses on emotional pain (""My mind is hell"") without expressing a wish for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned or framed as unwanted; instead, the distress stems from rumination about the relationship.  
   → **No explicit suicidal intent or desire to die is present**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or plans are referenced.
   - No preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are described.  
   → **Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses ongoing distress (""the last few months"") and future-oriented but ambiguous intent (""have to stop it""), but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are mentioned.  
   → **No evidence for 'Attempt'**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and exhaustion but **lacks a clear, personal desire to die or explicit suicidal intent**. The phrase ""stop it"" is ambiguous and insufficient to indicate suicidal ideation without corroborating context.  
   - Since there is no explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt, the post aligns with **'Indicator'** (general distress without suicidal intent).  
   - Ambiguity about the meaning of ""stop it"" leans toward 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness, anhedonia (loss of interest in activities like art), feeling ""irreparably fucked up,"" and uncertainty about the future. 
   - Explicitly mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all.""
   - No specific methods, plans, timelines, or preparations (e.g., tools, notes) are described.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned (only contemplation). 
   - The phrase ""contemplate suicide"" indicates persistent suicidal thoughts, but the framing (""constantly contemplate"") suggests ongoing distress rather than imminent intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states they ""constantly contemplate suicide."" 
   - **Yes**: ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" expresses a passive desire to not exist.
   - **No**: There is no statement rejecting or disavowing these thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on them"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No method/plan**: No mention of specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations. 
   - **No preparation**: No references to notes, acquiring means, or final arrangements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **current mental state** (hopelessness, suicidal contemplation) and **past experiences** (loss of passion), but **no past or recent suicidal actions** are described. ""Contemplate"" refers to thoughts, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""constantly contemplate suicide"") and desire to not exist place this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no genuine suicidal desire). 
   - Absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*. 
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*. 
   - The core content aligns with **Ideation**: active suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions suffering (trauma, OCD, anhedonia, abuse) and feeling life is ""a bust."" 
   - References suicide abstractly (""if suicide is better,"" ""the release"") but frames it as a hypothetical question (""When to know if..."") and seeks validation from others (""if anyone else feels..."").
   - Expresses hopelessness (""all I have is that"") but no explicit personal desire to die *now*.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions described.  
   - Focuses on philosophical questioning (""can I go back?"") and validation-seeking.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I will die.""  
   - Suicide is discussed as a concept (""if suicide is better"") or potential ""release,"" but the author does not state *they personally want to act on it*.  
   - The tone is reflective/questioning, not declarative of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past or imminent actions. Only abstract consideration of suicide's value.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress and references suicide abstractly but lacks a **personal, current desire to die** or explicit suicidal intent.  
   - The author questions if suicide ""is better"" and seeks others' perspectives, framing it as a theoretical dilemma rather than a personal plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions specific medications and quantities: ""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg"".
   - Expresses desire to ""go sleep forever"" and emotional distress: ""can't take this shit no more,"" ""sick and tired of my shitty life,"" indicating hopelessness.
   - No explicit past actions or attempts described (e.g., no ""I took..."" or ""I tried..."").
   - Imminent intent implied by ""wanna go sleep forever"" but no explicit timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""go sleep forever"" is a clear metaphor for death, combined with distress. Desire to die is strongly implied (""can't take this shit no more"").
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die""). Leans toward active wish.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Specific method mentioned**: Overdose via identified medications (Seroquel and Viepax) with exact quantities and dosages. 
   - **Preparation indicated**: Possession of the means (""I have..."").
   - This satisfies criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes current possession of means and desire, but no initiated action (e.g., no ""I took them"" or ""I tried""). Focus is on intent and preparation, not past behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (overdose) + possession of means = **Behavior**.
   - Not 'Indicator' (desire is clear and personal). Not 'Ideation' (method/preparation present). Not 'Attempt' (no initiated action described).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include depression, misery, hopelessness (""no way out""), feeling like a burden (""not fair to people to deal with me""), and despair (""It hurts"").  
   - **No mention** of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans (e.g., ""I will do X tonight""), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, notes), or past/current actions (e.g., ""I tried"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide methods: ""tried with a knife"" (past action), ""I have a rope"" (current possession of means), and reference to a location (""building"").  
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I want this to end,"" ""I am scared,"" and expressions of hopelessness (""I should've done it a long time ago"").  
   - Specific past actions: ""tried with a knife"" (initiated but failed).  
   - Preparations: Possessing a rope and scouting a location (""building""), though concern about traumatizing others shows hesitation.  
   - Desire: Explicit stated desire (""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end,"" and regret over not acting sooner (""I should've done it"") confirm a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (knife, rope) and a location (building) are mentioned. Current possession of a rope (""I have a rope"") indicates preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past action**: Describes a concrete, potentially lethal act (""I tried with a knife. It didn't work"").  
   - **Current/future intention**: Expresses intent to act (""I have to do it"") with a method (rope) and location (building), despite fear.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core distinction hinges on the **past initiated action**. The phrase ""tried with a knife"" describes a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal act (even though it failed). This meets the 'Attempt' criteria.  
   - While current plans/behavior (rope, building) are present, the explicit description of a **past attempt** takes precedence per the rules.  
   - Contrasts with 'Behavior' (no initiated action) or 'Ideation' (no method/prep).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes key elements: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a desire for death. ""But I will, as always"" indicates hopelessness and despair. ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" references a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") and implies a future intention tied to depression.

   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""won't wake up"" is a euphemism for death, and ""attempt"" explicitly refers to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""as always""), despair (linked to Christmas and loneliness).
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No current plan, method, or preparation is described. ""Attempt properly again"" refers to a past action but lacks details about method or current preparations.
   - References to past actions: ""attempt properly again"" confirms a concrete past suicide attempt by the author.
   - Imminence: The future attempt is conditional (""that'll probably get me depressed enough""), not immediate. The hope not to wake up is passive and not tied to a specific action.
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a genuine wish to die (""Hopefully I won't wake up"") and does not indicate that suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempt"" in the context of suicide, and ""won't wake up"" conveys a clear desire to die. There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts; the desire is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for a current or future act. The reference to ""attempt properly again"" is about a past event and does not detail a current plan. Thus, there is no indication of current planning, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes both current/future ideation (hoping not to wake up, potential future attempt) and a past action: ""attempt properly again"" refers to a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred in the past. This past action is concrete, as implied by ""again"" and the word ""attempt,"" which indicates initiation, even if it failed or was interrupted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a desire to die (suicidal ideation), but the key factor is the clear description of a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again""). According to the 'Attempt' definition, if a past potentially lethal action is described, it takes precedence over current ideation or behavior. There is no current plan or method specified, so 'Behavior' does not apply. The past action distinguishes this from 'Ideation' (which lacks past attempts) or 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicidal desire). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions seeking someone to ""kill me,"" ""hide my body,"" and ""chop me up,"" indicating a direct desire for death and specific violent methods.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ensuring the family ""never finds out"") and a clear wish to disappear permanently.  
   - Specific methods/preparations are described: being killed by another person, body dismemberment, and concealment.  
   - No past actions are mentioned; the focus is on future intentions.  
   - The desire to die is explicit and unambiguously stated (e.g., ""looking for someone to kill me"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""kill me"" and ""chop me up"" directly express a personal desire to die. There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, the post details a method (being killed and dismembered by another person) and preparations (hiding the body to avoid discovery).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a *future* intention (""looking for someone"") with a plan but no indication of an initiated or past lethal action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation (recruiting help, dismemberment, concealment) aligns with **Behavior**.  
   - No concrete past/initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"") exists, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - The specificity of the plan/method distinguishes it from **Ideation** (thoughts without a plan) or **Indicator** (no genuine desire to die).

365,"I'm fed up with it. It's now going on 10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts. Circumstances have changed, I've had great highs and rock bottom lows, but none of it matters. Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them; some days are easier than others. Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" and a 10-year struggle with these thoughts. Emotional indicators include ""fed up,"" ""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" and frustration (""fed up with fighting this crap""). There is no mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The author explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die,"" and describes actively suppressing thoughts. No past or recent suicidal actions are described—only ongoing thoughts and fantasies. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""); it's a chronic issue.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death.""
   - However, the desire to die is explicitly negated: ""I have no desire to die."" The thoughts are described as unwanted and fought against (e.g., ""I fight to suppress them""), indicating distress about the thoughts themselves rather than a current personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The content focuses solely on thoughts and fantasies, with no reference to tools, locations, or actions. Phrases like ""fantasizing about my death"" suggest ideation without concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a long-term struggle (10 years) with thoughts but no past or recent actions. The author states, ""I'm still here,"" implying no initiated lethal actions. There is no description of an attempt (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit negation of desire to die (""I have no desire to die"") and the focus on fighting unwanted thoughts align with 'Indicator' (distress about suicidal thoughts without personal desire to act).
   - While suicidal thoughts are present, the absence of a plan/method rules out 'Behavior'. The lack of any described past or recent actions rules out 'Attempt'. The clear statement against wanting to die distinguishes this from 'Ideation', which requires a personal expression of desire to die.

Final decision: 'Indicator' fits best, as the post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but no current suicidal intent or plan.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I just really wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" indicating a personal desire to die. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't have any more options""), despair (""I feel unimportant""), and anhedonia (""every time I see things... gets me more depressed"").
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
   - The writer repeatedly states an inability to act: ""I just can't,"" ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest,"" indicating no initiation of action.
   - There is no reference to past suicidal actions or attempts. 
   - Temporal context focuses on ongoing distress (""every day,"" ""usually"") with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this"" confirm a current personal desire to die. 
   - The writer does **not** frame suicidal thoughts as unwanted (e.g., ""my brain says X, but I don't want to""). Instead, they express genuine distress about their inability to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific plan/method**: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations. The focus is on emotional barriers (""I can't harm myself"") rather than logistical planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes ongoing feelings and desires but **no past or recent concrete actions**. Statements like ""I can't harm myself"" negate any initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""wish to end my life"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, so 'Behavior' is ruled out.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent, as no past/recent lethal actions are described.  
   - The core is a **desire to die without actionable plans**, fitting 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress with phrases like ""lost control of my head,"" ""want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream,"" and a plea for help (""help please""). 
   - There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of overwhelm and panic, but no clear hopelessness or despair linked to suicidal intent. 
   - The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" suggests aversion to a recurring painful experience, but it is vague and does not indicate a desire for death; it emphasizes not wanting to endure distress again. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. 
   - The writer's stated desire includes seeking help (""help please""), which contradicts a wish to die, and there is no expression of unwanted suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die or not be alive; ""I don't want to live this again"" is contextualized as not wanting to repeat distress, not a wish for death. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant. 
   - Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator' due to lack of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are referenced. 
   - Without any suicidal desire, this step does not apply, but even if ideation were present, there is no plan to escalate to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a vague reference to past experiences (""live this again""), but no description of a specific, initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt). 
   - No evidence of past or recent potentially lethal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows general distress and a cry for help without explicit suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt. 
   - ""I don't want to live this again"" is ambiguous but, in context, reflects distress about an experience, not a personal wish for death; thus, it does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation'. 
   - According to the rules, if ambiguous or lacking explicit suicidal desire, default to 'Indicator'. 
   - Rules emphasize that only the author's risk matters, and there is no indication of suicidal intent for the writer.

It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me.

And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense distress (""It's too hard,"" ""this fucking sickness god it's horrible"") and hopelessness about an ongoing struggle (""I have tried so hard to stop it and it just keeps getting worse"").  
   - Key explicit elements:  
     - **Mentions ""reason to die""** and **""decided this is it""** in the context of the author’s personal struggle.  
     - **References leaving a suicide note**: ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it.""  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.  
   - The author describes frustration with family dismissing their pain but does not describe initiating a concrete suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""my reason to die"" and ""decided this is it"" reflect a personal desire to end life, not abstract distress.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit mention of **preparing a suicide note** (""I left a note"") as part of their decision. This is a documented preparatory step.  
   - No specific method or location is stated, but the note confirms tangible preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The note is described as a past preparation (""I left a note""), but there is **no mention of initiating a potentially lethal action** (e.g., taking pills, cutting). The focus is on planning (the note) and expressing intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""reason to die,"" ""this is it"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While direct suicidal desire is present, the **suicide note** signifies preparation, pushing this to 'Behavior'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No described action was initiated (e.g., ""I took pills"" or ""I tried to cut""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal desire + preparation (note) = **Behavior**.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions deep hopelessness (""I don't deserve anything""), despair (""I blew it. All of it""), being a burden (""I don't want to be a burden anymore""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I just. Want. To die"").  
   - Directly references past suicidal ideation (""screamed that I wanted to die"") and current intent (""How do I kill myself..."").  
   - Specific method is not detailed, but explicitly asks for a method (""How do I kill myself without leaving a body...""), indicating active consideration of means/preparations.  
   - No past suicide *actions* described—only ideation and current planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I just. Want. To die"" and ""How do I kill myself"" are explicit, personal expressions of desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" explicitly seeks a method and considers logistics (avoiding burden on parents), indicating active planning/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes historical ideation (""never been far away from my mind since"") but no past *actions*. Focus is on current intent and planning.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and suicidal intent (""kill myself"") move this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Mention of method-seeking (""How do I kill myself..."") shows planning/preparation, elevating it from *Ideation* to *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense hopelessness (""no point in it all,"" ""don't see a future,"" ""growing more dim,"" ""disappointing those who care"").  
   - References metaphorical self-harm/suicide ideation: ""push me over the edge,"" ""one last push... I'll be free,"" and ""eternal void.""  
   - Expresses anhedonia (nothing makes them ""truly happy"") and feeling like a burden (""people are starting to lose hope in me"").  
   - No explicit suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, or plans).  
   - No past actions or attempts described; all language is future-oriented (""I'll be free"").  
   - Temporal cues are vague (""one last push,"" ""no point in waiting""), lacking imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**: Phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" and ""eternal void"" **imply** suicidal thoughts but lack direct terms (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - **No**: The desire to escape suffering is clear, but a *genuine wish to die* isn't explicitly stated. The framing focuses on distress (""trapped in limbo"") rather than active intent.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"") is present, but the ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator' per rules.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Metaphorical language (""push,"" ""edge,"" ""void"") doesn’t describe concrete means (e.g., pills, weapons).  
   - **No preparations**: No mentions of notes, goodbyes, or acquiring tools.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future despair (""I need,"" ""I'll be free""), with no past actions or attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong distress and implied suicidal thoughts exist, but the *explicit personal desire to die* is absent (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Metaphors are ambiguous, so 'Indicator' takes precedence per the rule: ""If in doubt... choose Indicator.""  
   - **No plan/method**: Without specifics, 'Behavior' is ruled out.  
   - **No past action**: 'Attempt' is inapplicable.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses suicide in a general, third-person context (""people who commit suicide""), focusing on reasons like bottling up emotions, dealing with pain alone, and eventually snapping or breaking down. There is no mention of death, dying, or suicide methods specific to the author. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, but these are described as a general human experience (""we've bottled everything up""), not as the author's current state. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions by the author are mentioned. The language is abstract and reflective, with no imminence (e.g., ""one day"" is vague). The author does not express a personal desire to die; instead, the focus is on understanding others' experiences.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" but only in reference to others, not the author themselves (e.g., ""People who commit suicide""). There is no clear, personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not attributed to the author personally, so the question of whether they are unwanted is irrelevant here. Since suicide is discussed abstractly without personal intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the author. The post describes general emotional processes, not any planning or actionable steps by the author. Therefore, there is no basis for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical scenario (""one day we just snap"") and general past behaviors (""bottled everything up""), but it does not reference any concrete, self-initiated actions by the author, such as a suicide attempt. There is no indication of recent or past lethal actions by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and abstract discussion of suicide, including emotional indicators like hopelessness, but lacks a personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The use of ""we"" is inclusive but does not shift to a first-person confession; it remains a broad commentary. Per the definition, 'Indicator' applies when suicidal thoughts are not personally expressed or are unwanted—here, there are no personal suicidal thoughts at all. There is no plan or method to elevate it to 'Behavior', and no past action for 'Attempt'. Ambiguity about desire defaults to 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""If I kill myself"" and ""I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever,"" indicating a personal desire to die by suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include anger, resentment (""fuck everyone I knew,"" ""I dont owe anybody shit""), and a sense of finality (""leave this world forever"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - The phrasing ""If I kill myself"" suggests a hypothetical/future intention but lacks temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"" express a clear, personal desire to die. The author does not negate or express distress about these thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicide intent is explicit, there is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""If I kill myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits best because:  
     - There is an explicit, personal desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""leave this world"").  
     - No plan/method/preparation is indicated (ruling out **Behavior**).  
     - No past/recent concrete suicidal actions are described (ruling out **Attempt**).

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""I am so tired of having to live,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I can't fucking function in this world""), anhedonia (""I feel nothing anymore,"" inability to engage in hobbies/hygiene), and perceived burdensomeness (""I feel no connection to them"").  
   - Explicitly mentions a future death wish: ""**Where do I see myself in five years? Dead.**""  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took steps"").  
   - Temporal context: ""Dead"" references a future state (5 years) but lacks immediacy (""tonight,"" ""now"") or concrete planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The phrase ""Dead"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to not be alive in the future, framed in the context of despair and inability to cope. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No mention of a plan, method (e.g., overdose, hanging), tools, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The statement about being ""dead"" in five years is a general outcome of despair, not a specific actionable intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described. The focus is on emotional suffering and future hopelessness, not initiated behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""Dead"") and absence of resistance to suicidal thoughts rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is a **personal desire to not be alive** without actionable intent, fitting *Ideation*.

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain,"" but in a hypothetical and general context (""someone""), not as a personal expression from the author. It is framed as a question about why people intervene in suicide, with disclaimers like ""No hate"" and ""Asking for a personal reason."" There are no emotional indicators of hopelessness or despair from the author, no specific methods, plans, or preparations described, and no references to past actions. The temporal context is abstract, with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The author does not express a personal desire to die; instead, they are inquiring about others' motivations for intervention.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self,"" but this is attributed to a hypothetical ""someone,"" not the author. The author does not express a clear personal desire to die or commit suicide. Phrases like ""Asking for a personal reason"" may imply relevance but do not constitute an explicit statement of suicidal intent. Since the suicidal reference is generalized and lacks personal ownership, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post discusses suicide abstractly without detailing any plan or actionable steps by the author. Therefore, there is no evidence to support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical scenario with no indication of past, current, or future actions initiated by the author. There is no description of a concrete suicidal act (e.g., an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content involves abstract discussion of suicide (""someone"") and distress about intervention, but it lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from the author. The hypothetical nature and questioning tone align with 'Indicator', which covers general distress or abstract mentions of suicide without explicit personal intent. Ambiguity about personal desire (e.g., ""personal reason"") should default to 'Indicator' per the rules. 'Ideation' is not appropriate because the author does not personally express a desire to die. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are ruled out due to the absence of plans, methods, preparations, or described actions.

375,"I been suicidal since I was since about 10 or 11. So remember when I was 10 or 11 I came home from school just to find out that my teacher called my mom because I failed the spelling bee test, so while I was in my backyard with my narcissistic mom scolded I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions suicidal thoughts and history, including a past ideation at age 10-11 (thinking about drowning in a lake but not acting on it) and current suicidal thoughts focused on ""suicide by a train.""
   - Emotional indicators include depression, hopelessness (""waking up everyday faking everything""), and a sense of burden.
   - Specific method is detailed: ""suicide by a train"" with a plan to ""put neck on the train tracks"" on a specific future date (18th birthday). The query about lethality (""will it instantly kill me"") indicates active consideration and preparation.
   - Past action: The drowning thought at age 10-11 was not acted upon (""I thought jumping in... she convince me not to""), so it was ideation, not an initiated action.
   - Imminence: The plan is set for the future (18th birthday, two years away), not immediate.
   - Desire: The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die through phrases like ""suicidal since I was 10 or 11"" and ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by a train,"" and expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""suicide by a train is on my mind"" and planning for it). There is no statement negating or rejecting these thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (""suicide by a train,"" ""put neck on the train tracks"") and preparations are implied through the detailed planning (""I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"") and the lethality inquiry. This indicates active consideration of means and timing.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The past event (age 10-11) involves suicidal ideation only (""I thought jumping in""), with no evidence of initiated action—it was a thought stopped by intervention. The current content focuses on future intentions with a plan, but no action has been initiated. The lethality question suggests preparation, but it is not a past or recent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts, moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which would apply if the thoughts were unwanted or vague).
   - The presence of a specific method (train tracks) and plan (18th birthday) elevates it from 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan) to 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action (the drowning was only a thought, not an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the category is 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal desire, specific plan, and method details.

It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I’ve had some suicidal thoughts through my life"") but states most are behind them.
    - Describes being triggered by someone else's suicide attempt, leading to renewed thoughts about suicide.
    - Explicitly states the thoughts feel more ""real"" and ""attainable"" now but emphasizes distress about this (""I just don’t want to think like this anymore"").
    - **No specific plan, method, preparation, timeline, or past personal suicide attempt** is mentioned. The focus is on intrusive thoughts and emotional distress.
    - Key emotional indicators: Distress over unwanted thoughts, feeling triggered, expressing a desire to stop these thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but framed as historical (""most of them are behind me"") or current intrusive thoughts caused by an external trigger.
    - **Crucially, the writer explicitly negates the desire for these thoughts**: ""I just don’t want to think like this anymore."" This indicates distress about the thoughts, not a current personal desire to die or act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
    - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post discusses abstract thoughts (""opens a window for me that it’s now ok to try"") without concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
    - References past suicidal thoughts (no indication of past actions).
    - Describes current unwanted intrusive thoughts but **no initiated action** (past or present). The phrase ""it’s now ok to try"" reflects a shift in perception, not a description of personal preparation or attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - The core of the post is distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts triggered externally. The writer explicitly states they do not want these thoughts.
    - No current desire to die is expressed; instead, there is aversion to the thoughts.
    - No plan, method, preparation, or past/current suicidal action exists.
    - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses distress and intrusive thoughts about suicide but explicitly rejects them as unwanted and lacks personal desire, plan, or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY,"" ""rage outbursts,"" ""depressive episodes,"" and ""just want my life to end.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress, hopelessness, and explicit desire for life to end.  
   - No references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""Just want my life to end"" expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive (Yes).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and a current desire for life to end.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""want my life to end"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method mentioned, so not Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions.  
   - Clear personal desire to die without plan/method → **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes dissociation, emotional numbness, and disconnection from life. Key elements include:
   - Explicit reference to a past suicidal action: ""nearly killing myself one night.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""everything seems so far out of my touch""), feeling detached (""not feeling like I'm the person I appear as""), and anhedonia (""I don't feel really anything"").
   - Future hypothetical risk: ""it'll only take one day where I step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" (implies possibility but no active plan/preparation).
   - Barriers to help: Lack of resources/mistrust of therapists.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""nearly killing myself one night"" directly references a personal past suicidal act.  
   - The hypothetical future scenario (""step off a building or over a bridge"") expresses a potential outcome of dissociation but lacks current desire (framed as passive/unintentional: ""without thinking"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Past method is implied (""killing myself"") but not detailed. The future reference mentions specific methods (jumping from building/bridge) but is speculative, not active planning/preparation.  
   - No evidence of current preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Crucially, the post describes a past concrete action**: ""nearly killing myself one night."" The phrasing ""nearly killing myself"" indicates an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., started but stopped/interrupted).  
   - The future scenario is hypothetical and lacks immediacy/imminence (""one day"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The past event (""nearly killing myself"") meets the criteria for **Attempt**: A self-initiated, potentially lethal action occurred, even if not fatal.  
   - Current expressions focus on dissociation/distress, and the future risk is passive/hypothetical (no active desire/plan).  
   - **Per IMPORTANT RULES**: 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past concrete action is described, regardless of current ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling overwhelmed (""too much happening""), hopelessness (""shits not worth it anymore""), self-perception as a burden (""disappoint and burden other people""), and explicitly states a desire to escape (""need a way out,"" ""i want to take myself out"").

   - **No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparation** (e.g., pills, note-writing) is mentioned.  
   - **No description of past/initiated actions** (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). Focus is on current thoughts/desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states personal desire (""i want to take myself out""), a clear euphemism for suicide. Fear of pain indicates conflict but does not negate the underlying desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, locations, or steps described). The phrase ""take myself out"" implies intent but lacks specificity.

   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated action (past or recent) rules out **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""emails to send to my parents before I do it"" (with ""do it"" strongly implying suicide), ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""My life is ruined""), despair (""I hate everything""), isolation (""I have nothing""), and self-loathing (""I hate who I am"").  
   - **Preparation**: Mention of ""emails to send to my parents before I do it"" indicates concrete planning (writing farewell notes).  
   - Imminence: ""before I do it"" suggests intent tied to sending emails, though no specific timeline.  
   - Desire to die: ""I've only thought about killing myself... nonstop"" confirms persistent desire; no statement negating intent.  
   - Past actions: No description of initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""killing myself,"" ""do it"" in suicidal context). Desire is affirmed, not rejected.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with ""Ending it soon,"" indicating a clear intention related to suicide.  
   - Emotional distress is evident (""so fucking depressed,"" hopelessness about life circumstances).  
   - Specific stressors include fear of the virus killing their supportive mother, loss of income, and a traumatic experience (""bad trip"").  
   - **Crucially, the writer explicitly states they ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan (a substance) and plan to take it all upon delivery**. This indicates both a method (overdose) and preparation (acquiring the means).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""Ending it soon"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no language suggesting unwanted thoughts).  
   - **Result: Explicit desire to die (Yes)**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Overdosing on dextromethorphan.  
   - Preparation: Ordering the substance and planning consumption (""taking it all as soon as it gets here"").  
   - **Result: Clear plan and preparation (Yes)**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here"").  
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no reference to having taken pills already).  
   - **Result: Planning/preparation for future action, not a past attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""Ending it soon"") and specific plan/method (dextromethorphan overdose) with preparation (ordered and awaiting delivery) align with **Behavior**.  
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday""), ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - The specificity of the method/preparation distinguishes this from **Ideation** (which lacks plans/methods).  
   - The direct suicidal intent distinguishes this from **Indicator** (which lacks personal desire to die).

    - There are **no explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.
    - The tone conveys frustration and disillusionment (""Let's be honnest"", ""fucking years""), but focuses on questioning the *value* of living rather than expressing a personal wish to die.
    - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have to live 60 years more"") and anhedonia (implied dissatisfaction with past/present life), but **no direct suicidal desire is stated**.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No**. The post does not use phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or ""end my life."" It questions humanity's desire to live generally (""how people can want to live?"") but does not state a personal desire for death or suicide. The closest sentiment is rhetorical frustration about longevity, not a declaration of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No**. There is zero mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, goodbyes), or timelines for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - **No**. The post discusses abstract philosophical discontent and future dread. It references the author’s past life dissatisfaction but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" ""attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The core sentiment is distress about life’s burdensomeness and duration, falling under **general hopelessness** without explicit suicidal desire.  
    - Lacks personal desire to die (""I want to die""), plan, method, or action.  
    - Ambiguity about suicidal desire leans toward **Indicator** per rules.  
    - Fits **Indicator**: Abstract dissatisfaction, rhetorical questioning of life’s value, and despair about the future—but no current, personal suicidal expression.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses the concept of ""passive suicidal"" individuals and ""suicide by cop"" as a hypothetical risk. Key elements include:
   - Mentions ""passive suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" as abstract concepts.
   - Focuses on others' behavior (""threaten to call the cops on *someone*"") and societal critique (""Why would people be so counterproductive?"").
   - No personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, hopelessness, or burden from the author.
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions described for the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Suicide is mentioned indirectly (""suicide by cop"") but only as a general concept. 
   - **No explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent expressed by the author**. The focus is on others' potential reactions.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - ""Suicide by cop"" is referenced as a method, but it is **not applied personally to the author**. 
   - **No plan, method, or preparation mentioned for the author**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a hypothetical scenario (""they may just think...""). 
   - **No past or recent actions initiated by the author are described**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author discusses suicide abstractly in a social commentary context. 
   - There is **no personal expression of desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions by the author**. 
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: General discussion of suicide risk in others, with no indication of the author's own suicidal state.

386,"Doctor says I might have Type 1 Diabetes, and I had a plan in mind ever since. The visit was recent, but the doctor says I might have type 1 diabetes. Going to get a blood test at some point to make sure but, if it turns out I do, it doesn't surprise me. Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions explicit suicidal intent: ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" (referring to using an insulin pump for suicide).
   - Describes a specific method: ""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"" via a pump, and references insulin pens as alternative means.
   - Notes preparations: Planning access to the pump if their condition worsens (""getting a pump if it gets bad"").
   - Expresses desire to die: ""the way I choose to go"" indicates active consideration.
   - References past ideation/planning: ""Had a couple ideas,"" ""Thought about doing it a couple times,"" but no initiated lethal action (only ""didn't because it was such a hassle"").
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling like a ""burden,"" lifelong depression.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Think that might be the way I choose to go"" directly links to suicide via insulin overdose. No negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific method (insulin overdose via pump/pen) and preparation (planning to acquire the pump for this purpose).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future-oriented plans** (using the pump) and **past ideation** (""Thought about doing it""), but **no initiated lethal action**. Mentions prior access to insulin pens but frames non-action due to hassle, not an interrupted/failed attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**not Indicator**).  
   - Specific method/preparation mentioned (pump/insulin overdose plan), so **not Ideation**.  
   - No description of a past/initiated lethal action (only thoughts/planning), so **not Attempt**.  
   - **Behavior** fits: Current suicidal intent with stated plan (using insulin pump) and preparation (seeking access to the means).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do and I have a chance right now.""
   - Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""I'm just tired of everything""), despair (""Worst birthday ever""), and feeling ignored or like a burden (""nobody told me happy birthday... they just walked past me like I was nothing"").
   - There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) described. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" implies opportunity but lacks concrete details about how the suicide would be carried out.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are made; the focus is on current feelings and intentions.
   - Imminence is suggested with ""right now,"" but it is not tied to a specific timeframe or actionable step.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""well I do"") without indicating that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and the author personalizes it with ""I do,"" indicating a clear desire to die.
   - No, there is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not intend to act on them. The desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - The vague reference to ""a chance"" does not constitute an explicit plan, so this leans toward 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""I have a chance right now"") but no past or recent initiated actions. There is no description of a concrete suicidal act that was carried out, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I do"" want to kill myself) rules out 'Indicator', which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts.
   - The lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior', as 'Behavior' requires explicit planning elements.
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - This fits 'Ideation': explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without a plan, method, or preparations.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide: ""finally considering suicide"" explicitly states the author is having suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators: High distress (""stressed,"" ""bawling,"" ""mental health has been bad,"" ""confused,"" ""desolate""), hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""Why should I give a shit""), and feeling like a burden (""wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: **No** specific method, tools, location, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Past actions: **No** description of past suicide attempts or initiated actions.  
   - Imminence: **No** timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") for acting on thoughts.  
   - Stated desire: The author expresses suicidal thoughts but implies ambivalence due to concern for parents (""I honestly wouldn’t give a shit if it weren’t for my parents"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, explicit mention: ""considering suicide.""  
   - **Yes**, desire implied by context (hopelessness, ""we all die right?""). However, the author also expresses a countervailing reason not to act (parents), indicating internal conflict but not a clear negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) mentioned.  
   - **No** preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current** suicidal thoughts (""finally considering suicide"") but **no past or recent actions** taken.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""considering suicide"") places this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** mentioned, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/initiated suicidal actions**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present with a stated desire (though conflicted), fitting *Ideation*. Ambivalence does not negate the expressed desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly describes a recent suicide attempt: ""I just attempted to end my life,"" with specific details like bleeding wrists and thighs, use of a knife, and being ""about to do"" it. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""shaking and bawling""), hopelessness (""Living life as a shell""), and frustration at not completing the act (""I'm too much of a pussy even kill myself""). 
   - Specific method and preparation are mentioned: using a knife for self-harm, resulting in bleeding. 
   - The event is recent (""just attempted"") and imminently dangerous, as the action was initiated but interrupted by the author (""I put down my knife""). 
   - The desire to die is clear and personal (""ready to leave everything,"" ""almost committed""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""almost committed,"" expressing a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method (knife for cutting) and signs of preparation/initiation (bleeding wounds, holding the knife) are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a very recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: cutting with a knife that caused bleeding and was stopped by the author. This constitutes an interrupted attempt, fitting the 'Attempt' criteria.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content goes beyond 'Indicator' (no distress without desire) or 'Ideation' (no action/plan), as there is explicit desire and initiated action. It exceeds 'Behavior' (planning/preparation only) because a concrete, potentially lethal action was taken, even though it was aborted. The description of a past/recent initiated action with potential lethality prioritizes 'Attempt' over other categories.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" and ""I feel like killing myself"" when interacting with parents. Emotional indicators like hopelessness (""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it,"" ""I'm at a dead end""), despair, and feeling like a burden are present. However, there is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The user explicitly denies any past attempts (""I've never actually attempted suicide"") and describes calling crisis hotlines but hanging up, indicating help-seeking rather than action. The desire to die is expressed (""wanting to"" attempt suicide), but it is coupled with an inability to act (""it is a lot harder than I want it to be,"" ""I don't have the guts""). No imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" multiple times in a personal context.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive, e.g., ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would,"" which implies a genuine wish to die if barriers were removed.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, the user focuses on the difficulty of acting on them, not a rejection of the desire itself. This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location for suicide is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described.
   - The presence of a desire to die without any plan or preparation supports 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references past suicidal thoughts and a persistent desire to die but explicitly denies any past actions: ""I've never actually attempted suicide."" Calling hotlines is described as an aborted help-seeking behavior, not a suicidal act.
   - There is no description of a specific, initiated suicidal action (e.g., taking pills) that was potentially lethal. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (e.g., wanting to die and thoughts of killing oneself), which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear current desire).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires at least an implied plan).
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The core of the post is the author's expressed desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but without actionable plans, fitting 'Ideation' best. Ambiguity about capability (e.g., ""harder than I want it to be"") does not negate the presence of ideation.

   - This confirms the presence of a plan and preparations, moving beyond mere ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""tonight"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. Writing a suicide note is a preparation, not an initiated suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit suicidal intent and desire rule out 'Indicator'.
   - Presence of a specific method (slitting wrists) and preparations (note, deleting things) means it cannot be 'Ideation', which lacks a plan/method.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no mention of having started or attempted self-harm) rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The combination of suicidal desire with a plan, method, and preparations fits 'Behavior'.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct phrase expressing personal desire to die.
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no language like ""but I don’t want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Timeline**: Specific plan to act in ""3 weeks.""
   - **Preparation**: Explicit preparatory steps (social withdrawal) tied to the suicidal intent.
   - Method is not specified, but concrete planning elements (timeline + behavioral preparation) are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes future intention (""gonna kill myself"").
   - No mention of past/initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.
   - Specific timeline and preparatory steps (social withdrawal) indicate planning, moving beyond mere *Ideation*.
   - Absence of past/recent initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.
   - Falls under *Behavior* due to stated intent combined with plan/preparation (timeline + behavioral change).

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" and ""Water bottle full of alcohol."" It directly asks, ""Would this kill me,"" indicating a focus on the lethality of this combination for self-harm.  
   - There are no explicit emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair), but the query about death implies suicidal intent.  
   - Specific methods are mentioned: overdose via medications and alcohol. The listing of exact quantities suggests possession or access, which could indicate preparation.  
   - No references to past actions or events; the post is speculative and future-oriented.  
   - Imminence is not stated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), but the question implies consideration of immediate use.  
   - The writer does not state a clear desire to die nor explicitly reject suicidal thoughts; the tone is questioning but centered on self-harm potential.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""Would this kill me"" does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it directly and personally references death in a self-harm context.  
   - It expresses an implied desire to understand if the method would cause death, but not a stated wish to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or rejected (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"").  
   - Leaning away from 'Indicator' due to the personal, method-focused nature.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are explicitly mentioned: overdose using Midol, Prozac (an antidepressant), Tylenol (acetaminophen, which can be lethal in overdose), and alcohol.  
   - Quantities (""3 bottles,"" ""30 20mg pills,"" ""bottle"") imply possession or access, which could indicate preparation (e.g., acquiring means).  
   - The question about lethality suggests planning or evaluation of a method.  
   - This strongly points to 'Behavior' due to the explicit method details and implied preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a potential future action (""Would this kill me"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I took"" or ""I tried"").  
   - It is contemplative and not descriptive of any concrete, self-initiated lethal action.  
   - Rules out 'Attempt' as there is no evidence of action being taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') by personally referencing death and specifying methods for potential self-harm.  
   - It includes explicit methods (overdose via listed substances), moving it from 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method) to 'Behavior'.  
   - The lack of initiated action confirms it is not 'Attempt'.  
   - Per 'Behavior' definition: The mention of specific substances and quantities constitutes a plan/method/preparation for suicide, even if framed as a question.  
   - Important: Ambiguity about desire is resolved by the method focus; when a plan/method is present, 'Behavior' overrides 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide (""end it,"" ""suicide"") and specific methods (""car accident or something"").
   - Emotional indicators: Concern for burdening loved ones, but overriding desire to die (""I'll get what I want"").
   - Specific plan: Disguising suicide as an accident to avoid impacting others.
   - No past actions described; focuses on future intentions.
   - Temporal context: ""Recently I've been thinking"" and ""planning"" indicate imminent consideration.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""end it,"" ""suicide,"" and ""I'll get what I want"" (referring to death) show a clear personal desire to die. No negation of this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Method is specified (""car accident or something"") and contextualized as a deliberate plan to disguise suicide. ""Planning to end it"" and ""thinking of doing it in a way"" confirms preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes future intent (""planning,"" ""thinking of doing it""), not past actions. No initiated lethal action mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** threshold met) + specific method/plan to disguise suicide as an accident (**Behavior** requirement). No past/ongoing action, so not **Attempt**.  
   - *Conclusion*: **Behavior** (suicidal thoughts + plan/method).

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep hopelessness, worthlessness (""lost cause,"" ""never had any skills""), perceived burdensomeness (""burden on my sister,"" ""make my family more resentful""), and repeated failure (""all I have ever done... become constantly stuck,"" ""any attempts... failed miserably""). There are mentions of family estrangement (""dad hardly talks to me"") and self-criticism (""mentally dumb,"" ""big fuck up""). **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations are present.** The distress centers on life failures and family dynamics.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: **No.** The post contains phrases like ""lost cause,"" ""always going to fail,"" and ""waste more money and time,"" but these reflect despair about life circumstances, not a stated desire to die or end one's life. There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, death wishes, or phrases like ""I want to die.""

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: **None.** The author discusses actions like applying for jobs or booking driving lessons, but these are efforts to improve their situation, not plans or preparations for suicide. No tools, locations, substances, or suicide-specific plans are referenced.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: **No initiated actions.** The post describes past failures in life (jobs, driving lessons) but no past or recent self-harm actions. All mentioned actions are non-suicidal life efforts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **distress, hopelessness, and burdensomeness** (key ""Indicator"" elements) but lacks any **explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent**.  
   - Without expressed suicidal thoughts, desire for death, plans, or past attempts, it does not meet thresholds for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt.  
   - Per the rules: When ambiguity exists about genuine suicidal desire (or no such desire is expressed), default to ""Indicator.""

   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., feeling alone and needing to ""pretend that I have a friend"") and despair, but no explicit suicidal thoughts. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present. 
   - The writer's stated desire is to connect with others for support to alleviate distress, not to express a wish to die or act on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No). 
   - It does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive; instead, the focus is on seeking help to feel better (No).

   - Due to the absence of suicidal intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to suicide (No). 
   - Without any suicidal desire or explicit planning, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a call for support, not past events or actions. 
   - There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to attempts, interruptions, or failures). 
   - The content is solely about feelings and seeking interaction, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions writing a note (a common suicide preparation).  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""light has disappeared,"" ""end of my rope,"" ""can't keep going""), worthlessness, isolation, and treatment failures.  
   - Describes a recent ER/hospital visit (context: seeking help after distress, not a self-initiated suicide act).  
   - States fear of death no longer deters them, implying increased risk.  
   - No explicit mention of suicide methods, timelines, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Strong implicit desire to die through phrases like ""can't keep going,"" ""last chance,"" and loss of deterrents.  
   - **Conclusion**: Leans toward 'Ideation' due to intense desire to escape suffering, but ambiguity persists.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""wrote a note today"" – a recognized suicide preparation (e.g., drafting a suicide note).  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or timing.  
   - **Conclusion**: Preparation (note-writing) qualifies as 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Hospital visit resulted from seeking help, not a self-initiated suicide act (e.g., ""reached out for help"").  
   - No description of past/current lethal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: No 'Attempt' (action was help-seeking, not self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Preparation (note) + desire to die = **Behavior**.  
   - 'Ideation' is insufficient due to explicit preparation.  
   - 'Attempt' is absent (no initiated lethal action).  
   - 'Indicator' is too low given explicit prep and desire.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""tried to end my life again,"" which explicitly refers to suicide and indicates a past action. ""Didn't work"" suggests the action was initiated but failed. There is no mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The emotional tone implies frustration or hopelessness due to the failure, but no current emotional indicators like despair or burden are detailed. The focus is on a past event, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer expresses a past desire to die through the action taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""tried to end my life"" is a direct and explicit statement of suicide intent from the author, indicating a genuine desire to die at the time of the action. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""I didn't want to do it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post only references the act of trying without details, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried"" and ""didn't work"" clearly refer to a concrete, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal but failed. This fits the definition of an 'Attempt' as it involves an initiated action, even if unsuccessful.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit personal expression of suicidal action, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because the post describes an actual action taken, not just thoughts or a desire without action.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation; the focus is on the past action itself.
   - It is 'Attempt' because the post centers on a past, potentially lethal action initiated by the author that failed. The rules state that if a past attempt is described, 'Attempt' takes precedence.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes a prolonged medical struggle following a head injury, detailing symptoms, failed treatments (doctors, neurologists, chiropractors, CBD oil, Cymbalta), and ongoing physical discomfort (head inflammation, tightness, zapping sensations). Key emotional indicators include ""I feel hopeless"" and ""I really don't know what to do anymore."" There is **no mention** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.

   - Specific methods are mentioned (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat""), but the author explicitly states having **no plans** and doubts about succeeding (""idk if this belongs here, I have no plans and I don’t think I’d succeed anyway"").  
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or imminent timelines are indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While methods (bullet, throat-slitting) are mentioned, the author explicitly states having **""no plans""** and doubts about success. There is no indication of preparing means, scouting locations, or setting a timeline.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **current feelings/thoughts** with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").

   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong desire to die is personally expressed, ruling out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit suicidal desire is present, but **no plan/preparation** is indicated (author denies plans). Mentioning methods alone without a plan leans toward 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ones"" (urges), ""thinking of killing myself,"" and ""I have a plan but no date set.""  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself""), hopelessness (""don't know what I want anymore""), and preoccupation with suicide's impact on loved ones.  
   - **Crucially, the author states: ""I have a plan but no date set.""** This confirms a specific suicidal plan exists, though no method or imminent timeline is detailed.  
   - No past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""suicidal ones,"" ""thinking of killing myself,"" and ""this might be our last conversation"" reflect a personal desire to die. The guilt about suicidal thoughts stems from their impact on others, not a rejection of the desire itself.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states, ""I have a plan but no date set."" This directly indicates a formulated plan, even if no method or date is specified.

   - The post discusses current urges and thoughts. No past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., initiating an overdose) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and admission of a plan (""I have a plan"") meets the criteria for **Behavior**, as ""plan"" is a definitive planning element.  
   - Lack of method details or imminence doesn’t negate this; the presence of a plan alone qualifies.  
   - No initiated lethal actions rule out ""Attempt.""

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses the user's experience with questionnaires about suicidal thoughts and therapy. Key elements include mentions of ""suicidal thoughts"" and the user's strategy of lying about them to avoid stress and intense questioning. Emotional indicators include feelings of being overwhelmed (""cause a massive issue,"" ""a lot of stress,"" ""therapy tough enough""), hopelessness (""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself""), and increasing frequency of these thoughts. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, or suicide methods. The focus is on the distress caused by the thoughts and the avoidance of disclosure, not on a personal desire to act. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines are indicated. The user refers to the thoughts as something to conceal, suggesting they are unwanted or distressing.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not include direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" or express a clear, personal desire to die. Instead, the context shows the user is distressed about the thoughts and actively avoids discussing them (""lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff""). The suicidal thoughts are framed as a burden or something to hide, indicating they may be unwanted. This aligns more with 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts, not a current personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The content is centered on the thoughts themselves and the user's coping strategy (lying), not on any actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and a pattern of increasing thought frequency, but no past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned. The metaphorical reference to a ""grave"" implies a sense of entrapment but does not describe any initiated, potentially lethal action. The absence of concrete actions rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and unwanted suicidal thoughts without a clear, personal expression of desire to die. The user's focus on avoiding discussion of thoughts (""lying about the suicidal thoughts"") supports that these thoughts are distressing but not desired. Since there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (no explicit wish to die), and no plan/method is present, 'Indicator' is the best fit. Rules emphasize choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' in cases of doubt or when desire is not clearly expressed.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""nearly killing myself"" (past context), ""shooting up the school"" (past context), ""I fucking hate living"" (current).
   - Emotional indicators: ""rotting away,"" ""hate living,"" despair about bullies escaping consequences, hopelessness (""what did I do wrong?"").
   - Specific plans/methods: None for the present. ""Shooting up the school"" is tied to past bullying pressure, not a current plan.
   - References to past actions: ""bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school"" implies past suicidal ideation under duress but **no concrete action taken** (""nearly"" suggests no attempt occurred).
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire: Explicit current desire not to live (""I fucking hate living"") with no stated resistance to suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""nearly killing myself"" (past) and ""I fucking hate living"" (current) show personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No current method, plan, or preparation mentioned. ""Shooting up the school"" is contextualized as a past ideation under bullying, not a current plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past: ""Nearly killing myself"" describes ideation (not an attempt), as ""nearly"" implies no action was initiated.
   - Present: ""I fucking hate living"" expresses current suicidal desire without action.
   - **No initiated suicidal action** (past or present) described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator?** No: Explicit current desire to die (""hate living"") rules this out.
   - **Behavior?** No: No plan, method, or preparation for current suicidal intent.
   - **Attempt?** No: ""Nearly killing myself"" indicates ideation, not an initiated lethal action.
   - **Ideation?** Yes: Clear personal desire to die (""I fucking hate living"") with no plan/method. Past ""nearly killing myself"" reinforces suicidal thoughts but lacks actionable evidence.

Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD. Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes a past overdose event where the author intentionally consumed ""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" and ""drank hard liquor from the bottle"" with the stated desire to die (""I wanted to""). They delayed seeking medical help (""held off going to the hospital"") and required hospitalization. The author reflects on the event and mentions ongoing distressing thoughts, but the core of the post focuses on describing a concrete past suicidal action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Explicit intent is present (""I wanted to"" die). The act is framed as intentional self-harm, not unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: A specific method (overdosing on ibuprofen + alcohol) and actions (swallowing pills, drinking liquor) are described. Preparation is implied by acquiring and consuming the means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post details a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (consuming a dangerous quantity of pills/alcohol) that resulted in hospitalization. This meets the criteria for an attempt, even though the outcome was survival.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The description of a concrete, life-threatening action initiated by the author (""Survived OD,"" consuming pills/alcohol to die) defines this as **Attempt**. While current distress is mentioned, the focus on a past lethal action takes precedence over concurrent ideation/behavior.

I have no issues with myself, but the world never fails to remind me how horrible it is. All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious. Suicide has become my quick solution.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""helpless,"" ""misunderstood,"" ""paranoid delusions,"" ""world is rotten,"" ""sick of every worthless person,"" ""words are meaningless,"" ""every action is malicious.""
   - Explicitly references suicide: ""Suicide has become my quick solution.""
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.
   - No descriptions of past/current actions (e.g., taking pills, self-harm) or attempts.
   - The phrase ""quick solution"" implies consideration but lacks immediacy (""tonight"") or concrete planning.
   - The author expresses a desire to escape (""get away from it all"") and frames suicide as a solution but does not negate or reject the desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" indicating personal consideration of suicide as a remedy for distress. No language suggests these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The reference to suicide remains abstract (""solution"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes ongoing distress and frustration but **no past/current suicidal actions**. The phrase ""has become"" suggests a present mindset, not an initiated act. References to past conversations (""told two people"") are about sharing feelings, not attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit suicidal intent (""Suicide has become my quick solution"") and desire to escape (""get away from it all"") confirm **Ideation**.
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No described actions (past/recent) rule out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is prominent, the explicit personal desire for suicide as a solution elevates it beyond **Indicator**.

It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post discusses depression, daily struggles, feelings of being misunderstood, and the persistent nature of depression.  
   - Mentions ""hearing the voice in death stranding '*keep on keeping on*'"" (a reference to a video game's motivational phrase), emphasizing endurance amid difficulty.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""every day feels like the previous one""), isolation (""only depressed people can understand""), and chronic suffering (""never really goes away"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Focuses on existential distress and questioning the existence of a ""long-term cure,"" but **lacks personal desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No** direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - **No** expressions of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I want it to be over"" is absent).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**; the distress is framed around enduring depression.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggle with depression.  
   - **No** mention of past/current suicidal actions, attempts, or interruptions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses **distress, hopelessness, and isolation** but **lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - The ""keep on keeping on"" phrase (though darkly contextualized) reinforces persistence, not intent to die.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: General distress without suicidal ideation/behavior. Ambiguous hopelessness leans toward this category per rules.

I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses the user's discovery of their father's suicide, feelings of inevitability (""it's inevitable for me""), prolonged distress (""ive felt like shit for years""), hopelessness (""reliving the same day everyday""), and functional impairment (skipping classes due to low energy). 
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: The user explicitly states ""I get suicidal thoughts,"" but this is qualified with ""but im probably too much of a pussy to ever do it,"" indicating a lack of intent to act. There is no mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions by the user. The only suicide reference is to the father's death, which is not the user's own behavior.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and despair are present, but the suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted and not actionable.
   - Temporal context: The suicidal thoughts are current, but there is no indication of imminence or a timeline for acting on them. The user expresses doubt about seeking help, reinforcing the distress without escalation to action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" from the user's perspective.
   - However, the desire to die is not clearly expressed; instead, the user negates any intent to act (""probably too much of a pussy to ever do it""), framing the thoughts as distressing but not representing a genuine, current desire to die. This aligns more with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the user's suicidal thoughts. The absence of any planning elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing distress and thoughts but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions by the user. The reference to the father's suicide is not the user's own behavior, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The user expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unlikely to act on them, indicating the thoughts are unwanted and do not reflect a current personal desire to die. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress with suicidal thoughts when they are not accompanied by intent or desire.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation, so 'Behavior' is not applicable. No past or recent suicidal action by the user, so 'Attempt' is ruled out. The ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention: ""i wanna off myself"" directly expresses a desire for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""can't see it getting better""), despair (""i fucking hate it here""), anhedonia, and burden feelings.
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or concrete steps).
   - No references to past actions or attempts; focuses on current thoughts/conflict.
   - Temporal context: Expresses ongoing internal struggle (""i'm scared,"" ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope"") with no imminent timeline.
   - Desire assessment: Expresses genuine wish to die (""wanna off myself"") but simultaneously voices ambivalence (fear of missing out, clinging to hope).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""i wanna off myself"" is a direct phrase indicating personal suicidal desire.
   - The ambivalence (fear/hope) does not negate the explicit desire to die; it coexists.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or plan (e.g., time, location) is mentioned.
   - No preparations described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).

   - Describes current/future intentions but no past or recent concrete actions initiated.
   - Therapy discontinuation is mentioned but is not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit personal desire to die (""wanna off myself"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.
   - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent distinguishes this from **Indicator**, despite ambivalence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post consists of abusive quotes from the author's parents, including multiple direct commands to commit suicide (e.g., ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already"").  
   - The parents reference the author's past actions: suicide attempts (""Did you try to kill yourself again?""), self-harm (""cut your wrists again""), and disordered eating (""vomit your food again"").  
   - The author does not explicitly state their *own current* suicidal desire, plan, or intent. Instead, they recount parental abuse and references to their past behaviors.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and worthlessness (e.g., parents calling the author ""disappointing,"" ""the problem,"" and claiming the family is ""disappointed"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The parents explicitly mention suicide methods (e.g., gun, cutting wrists), but these are commands/taunts directed *at* the author, not first-person statements *from* the author.  
   - The author does not personally express a desire to die or current suicidal thoughts. The only first-person statement is questioning their father (""why did you want to have a daughter""), which reflects distress, not suicidal intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit personal desire to die from the author.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are mentioned (gun, cutting wrists), but only by the parents in abusive contexts. The author does not describe any personal plans, preparations, or current intent to use these methods.  
   - Past actions (e.g., vomiting food, self-harm) are referenced but not framed as active preparations for suicide.  
   - **Conclusion**: No current plan/method/preparation by the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **past actions** by the author: suicide attempts (""try to kill yourself again""), self-harm (""cut your wrists""), and disordered eating. These are concrete, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author and referenced by the parents.  
   - No description of ongoing/imminent actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author does not express personal suicidal desire/ideation (*not Ideation*).  
   - There is no current plan/preparation (*not Behavior*).  
   - **Past suicide attempts and self-harm are explicitly described** (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again""). These are concrete, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author, fitting the **Attempt** category.  
   - Emotional distress is present, but the clear references to past suicidal actions override an *Indicator* classification.

415,What's the least painful way to kill yourself?. I know I shouldn't be asking this but I just need a way to Kim's. I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit someone just give me a straight up answer.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly asks ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"" and repeats the request for a method (""give me a straight up answer""). 
   - Mentions suicide directly (""kill yourself"") and seeks practical information about methods, indicating a focus on means. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""I know I shouldn't be asking this"") and urgency (""I just need a way""). 
   - No references to past actions, preparations, or stated desire to avoid acting on thoughts. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill yourself"" and persistent requests for methods imply personal suicidal desire. No negation of intent (e.g., no ""I don’t want to do it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: The core of the post is actively seeking a specific method (""least painful way""), which constitutes implicit planning. The demand for actionable answers (""straight up answer"") reinforces this.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No description of past/current actions (e.g., no ""I tried X""). Focus is on future intent (""need a way"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + active inquiry about methods aligns with **Behavior**. While no concrete plan is stated, soliciting method details qualifies as preparatory behavior. Rules specify: ""If there is *any* mention of a method, it leans towards 'Behavior'."" Ambiguity is resolved by the explicit method-seeking context.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""write a suicidal note again,"" which directly references suicide and indicates a preparatory action for suicide. The phrase ""again"" suggests a history of this behavior. There is emotional distress indicated by ""my stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside,"" showing internal suffering and hopelessness. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, or specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping). The focus is on the act of writing a suicide note as a preparation step. The temporal context is future-oriented (""I think I'm going to""), with no description of past or recent initiated lethal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide through the term ""suicidal note,"" which implies a personal connection to suicidal intent. There is a clear indication of preparation for suicide, and no statement negating the desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to do this""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, writing a suicide note is identified as a specific preparation for suicide, as defined in the 'Behavior' category (e.g., ""writing my suicide note"" is listed as an example of preparation). No method (e.g., tools, substances) or location is mentioned, but the note-writing itself constitutes preparation, pushing this toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I think I'm going to"") to engage in preparatory behavior (writing a note). There is no mention of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no description of taking pills or self-harm that was stopped). The word ""again"" refers to past behavior but does not describe a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated; it only references past note-writing, which is preparatory and not an attempt. Thus, this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (through ""suicidal note"") and specific preparation (writing the note) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which requires no plan or preparation) to 'Behavior'. The lack of any initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. While there is emotional distress, the suicide-specific preparation prevents it from being 'Indicator'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""committing a massacre"" (which may imply harm to others but is not directly suicidal) and ""slaying myself"" (a direct reference to self-inflicted death, equivalent to ""killing myself""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Phrases like ""I will end up"" convey hopelessness and inevitability, but no specific emotional descriptors like despair or anhedonia are present.
   - Plans/methods/preparations: ""Slaying myself"" is vague; no specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Committing a massacre"" is not clearly a suicidal method and lacks detail.
   - Past actions: None described; the post focuses on future possibilities.
   - Imminence: ""Will end up"" suggests a general future intent but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Stated desire: The phrase ""maybe just slaying myself"" expresses a personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""slaying myself"" is an explicit and direct phrase indicating a desire to die, similar to ""kill myself."" The author personally expresses this for themselves.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, means) is mentioned in relation to ""slaying myself."" The reference is general and lacks concrete details. ""Committing a massacre"" is ambiguous and not clearly tied to a suicidal plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I will end up,"" ""maybe"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is not describing an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal intent (""slaying myself"") but no plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.
   - The desire to die is personally expressed and not negated, so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires lack of personal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - Therefore, it fits 'Ideation': explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, without specific plans or methods.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and self-criticism about isolation (""I wish I had friends""), inertia (""laziness""), and perceived failure (""failed three classes"").  
   - **Explicit mention**: The phrase ""my suicidal ideation"" appears but is immediately contextualized by the writer stating, ""I realize that I don’t want to die—I want to live,"" and attributes the ideation to shame about passivity.  
   - **No explicit desire to die**: The writer explicitly negates a wish to die and frames suicidal thoughts as unwanted (""stems from shame"").  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation**: No references to suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparatory actions (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - **No past actions**: No description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts.  
   - **Temporal context**: Focuses on ongoing struggles, not imminent or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Explicit mention?** Yes (""suicidal ideation"" is used).  
   - **Desire to die?** No—explicitly rejected (""I don’t want to die—I want to live"").  
   - **Unwanted thoughts?** Yes—ideation is framed as a symptom of shame, not a current desire.  
   → Leans strongly toward **Indicator**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - None identified. The term ""ideation"" is used abstractly without specifics.  
   → Supports **Indicator/Ideation** boundary (no plan = not Behavior).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described.  
   → Rules out **Attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but explicitly disavows a desire to die.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Not **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated action → Not **Attempt**.  
   - Explicit rejection of death desire + abstract ideation mention → **Indicator** (per rules: ""If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but unwanted/distressing without genuine desire, choose Indicator"").  
   - Ambiguity rule: When unsure between Indicator/Ideation due to disavowed desire, default to **Indicator**.

I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions a specific suicidal method: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hesitation and fear of permanent disability, but the core desire to die is present (""I wanna..."").  
   - A plan is outlined: accessing a specific weapon (dad's handgun) and using it.  
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on future intent tempered by fear.  
   - The writer explicitly states they are ""not risking it"" due to fear of disability, but this does not negate the suicidal desire or the articulated plan/method.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""shoot myself in the head"" confirm explicit personal suicidal intent. The hesitation is about consequences, not a lack of desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A specific method (shooting with a handgun) and means (""dad's handgun"") are explicitly mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes future intent (""wanna get"") but **no past/initiated action** (e.g., no attempt made). The reluctance is hypothetical, not an account of interrupted/failed behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire and a specific plan/method are both present**, satisfying the criteria for **Behavior**.  
   - Hesitation due to fear of disability does not invalidate the explicit plan/method; it merely contextualizes the risk.  
   - No past action occurred, ruling out **Attempt**. The presence of a method disqualifies **Ideation**, and explicit personal intent disqualifies **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""my life isn't worth living anymore,"" ""unbearable""), despair, anhedonia (""nothing I can enjoy""), and perceived burden (financial dependence, useless degree). 
    - There are passive references to death/dying (""life isn't worth living,"" ""can't see myself having a life worth living""), but **no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**. 
    - The writer focuses on distress from chronic illness and life circumstances, wishing for divine intervention rather than self-initiated action. Emotional tone is anger/helplessness, but desire to die is framed as conditional (""If my breathing doesn't go back to normal..."") and passive.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct equivalents. 
    - Desires expressed are **passive** (life not worth living) rather than active intent to die. No stated desire for death itself—only distress about circumstances. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **Absent**. No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Describes **ongoing suffering** with no reference to past/planned actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post shows severe distress and passive hopelessness but **lacks explicit personal desire to die**, suicidal intent, plans, or actions. Conditional statements (""can't see myself having a life worth living"") reflect despair, not active ideation. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire defaults to 'Indicator' per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon.""  
   - Desire to die: ""by February I think I'll be gone"" and ""don't see the point anymore.""  
   - Temporal context: Plans to delay until after Christmas, with a timeline (""by February"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - No description of past/current actions (e.g., attempts).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""don't see the point"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""I'll be gone"" express a personal desire to die. The writer does not negate this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: While timing (""by February"") implies planning, there is no mention of tools, locations, or concrete steps (e.g., ""using pills,"" ""going to the bridge""). General timing alone is insufficient for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Future intention (""soon,"" ""by February""), but **no initiated action** (past or recent). Only discusses thoughts/plans, not concrete acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (rules out 'Indicator').  
   - No method/preparation details (rules out 'Behavior').

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains key elements: explicit expressions of a desire to die (""I just want to die"") and suicidal intent (""gonna end my life this month""). It includes emotional indicators of despair (""Too many problems, im a fucked up person""). However, no specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The timeframe ""this month"" indicates future intention but is not tied to a concrete plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die with phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""gonna end my life."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated by the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""gonna end my life this month"" implies intent but lacks details about how, where, or with what, so it does not qualify as a plan or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post discusses future intentions (""gonna end my life this month"") and expresses current suicidal thoughts. There is no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt that was started but stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The content shows a clear desire to die, placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire). The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. With no mention of a past or recent initiated action, it cannot be 'Attempt'. Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it involves explicit personal suicidal thoughts without a plan or method.

   - Key phrases: ""mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs [thoughts]"" (acknowledged as part of their experience) and ""helped me to understood the world.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness about the world (""shitty modern world""), frustration (""got called pessimistic""), and suffering (""I'm suffering"").

   - The tone is explanatory/defensive (justifying their worldview), not actively suicidal.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

Emotional indicators include guilt or concern for others (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom"") and hopelessness about the future. There is no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) described, but there is a clear timeframe (""this weekend"") and a preparatory action (creating a will). No past actions or attempts are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire to die through indirect but unambiguous language (e.g., ""get it over with,"" ""my death will be following very soon""). The use of ""attempt"" in context strongly suggests suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the author appears resolved.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - While no specific method (e.g., tool or location) is mentioned, there is explicit preparation: ""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This constitutes a concrete step in planning for death. The timeframe (""this weekend"") also indicates planning. Since preparation is present, this leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"") and preparatory steps (creating a will), not past actions. No initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., a past attempt) is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (ruling out 'Indicator') but lacks a specific method, which might suggest 'Ideation'. However, the mention of preparation (will) and a timeframe pushes it to 'Behavior'. 'Behavior' includes suicidal thoughts with any plan or preparation, even if the method isn't specified. 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action is described. Since there is preparation, 'Behavior' is the best fit over 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses ambivalence about life/death: ""I don't wanna die"" but ""i really cannot live if i fail"" [a test].  
   - Explicitly mentions methods: ""no access to my meds [potential overdose], no place to jump from, the blades... won't go that deep"" [cutting].  
   - Describes past self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") but not a past suicide attempt.  
   - States current emotional improvement (""almost happy,"" ""decent place,"" ""want to keep doing things"").  
   - Suicidal intent is conditional (""if I fail"" the test) and conflicted (contrasts current purpose with hopelessness about failure).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The author directly links failing the test to suicide (""decide whether or not I'll live,"" ""cannot live if I fail"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (overdose via meds, jumping, cutting) are mentioned, though current access is denied (""no access,"" ""no place,"" blades ""won't go that deep"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on *future* conditional intent (""if I fail"").  
   - References past self-harm (cutting) but **no description of a past suicidal act** (e.g., overdose or jumping attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die exists (conditional on failing the test).  
   - Specific methods are mentioned (meds, jumping, cutting), meeting the threshold for **Behavior**.  
   - No past or recent *initiated suicidal action* (only past self-harm, which is distinct from a suicide attempt).  
   - Current lack of access to methods doesn’t negate the presence of a plan; it confirms the author has considered means.

And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
    - Key elements: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""I don't see a point,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore""), exhaustion (""drained me the fuck out""), disillusionment with systems (school/work/family), and feelings of being trapped (""stuck in a system"").  
    - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods.  
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, worthlessness (""useless to support them""), anhedonia (""taken my will to strive""), and feeling trapped.  
    - No plans, methods, preparations, or temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").  
    - No references to past actions.  
    - The distress centers on existential despair and systemic frustration, **not** a stated desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
    - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.  
    - No clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone"" is absent).  
    - The phrase ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" implies distress about purpose/direction, **not** active suicidal desire.  
    - **Conclusion:** Explicit suicidal intent is absent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
    - No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations.  
    - **Conclusion:** No evidence of planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
    - Describes ongoing emotional struggle, not past/current actions.  
    - **Conclusion:** No initiated suicidal acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
    - The post shows severe distress (hopelessness, exhaustion) but lacks:  
      - Explicit desire to die (ruling out *Ideation*).  
      - Any plan/method (ruling out *Behavior*).  
      - Any description of past/current self-harm actions (ruling out *Attempt*).  
    - Primary themes are disillusionment and emotional overwhelm, falling under **Indicator** (general distress without personal suicidal desire).

   - Explicitly states a desire for help (""I want help so badly"") but no negation of suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""die alone,"" and ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"" confirm a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Specific methods are detailed (""slitting my wrist,"" ""shoot myself with a gun""). No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned, but the clear description of methods qualifies as planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes future intent (""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do..."") with no mention of past/initiated actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** baseline) + specific methods (**Behavior**).  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action (rules out **Attempt**).  
   - Distress about circumstances exists, but the unambiguous suicidal intent with methods overrides **Indicator**.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die."" Desire is personal and current, despite guilt preventing action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (isopropyl alcohol, hanging, car collision) and preparations (calculations, strength testing, timing, concealment) are explicitly detailed.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** baseline).  
   - Specific plans, methods, and preparations (**Behavior**).  
   - No initiated lethal action (rules out **Attempt**).  
   - Guilt prevents action but does not negate active planning.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a persistent desire to die (""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""i'm not cut out for life""). 
    - Strong emotional indicators include hopelessness (""can't even imagine mine being worth living""), self-blame (""selfish and weak""), and rejection of help (""not interested in being talked down"").
    - Mentions hesitation about contacting loved ones (grandparents, friends, brother) due to fear it might be interpreted as seeking intervention, but this reflects internal conflict, not preparation.
    - **No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., no notes, means, or timelines beyond ""very soon"" without actionable details).
    - **No description of past/current suicidal actions** (e.g., no initiated attempts).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and unequivocal desire to die (e.g., ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""i'm not cut out for life""). The author explicitly rejects help, confirming active suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No**. While ""the day i chose is very soon"" implies intent, it lacks specificity about method, location, or tangible preparations. Mentions of calling family/friends reflect ambivalence, not planning (e.g., not framed as ""goodbye"" actions).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Focuses on persistent ideation (""over a decade"") and future intent (""very soon""), but **no description of past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or rehearsals).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Explicit desire to die** rules out 'Indicator'. 
    - **No method, plan, or preparations** rules out 'Behavior'. 
    - **No initiated lethal actions** rules out 'Attempt'. 
    - The core is **suicidal thoughts + desire without actionable plan**, fitting 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicitly mentions ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" and ""I Just want to be out of my misery,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to escape suffering.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I've been in pain for over 5 years,"" ""cba anymore"") and social withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone"").  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" pills, notes) is mentioned.  
   - No reference to past/current suicide actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: Uses the term ""suicidal"" and states ""I Just want to be out of my misery,"" confirming a personal desire to die.  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). Social withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone"") suggests isolation but is not a suicide-specific preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes current suicidal intensity (""most suicidal...in a couple months"") but no past/ongoing suicide actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**

   - **Ideation?** Yes: Clear personal desire to die (""want to be out of my misery"") and explicit suicidal thoughts, but no plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of death and suicide: ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and frustration, as seen in ""Why is it so hard to die"" and the struggle to find a ""suitable way to go.""
   - There is no specific method, tool, location, or substance mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, guns, bridges, etc.). The phrase ""can't find a suitable way"" implies a search for a method but does not describe a concrete plan.
   - No preparations are indicated (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means, or goodbyes).
   - The context is current desire and thoughts, with no reference to past actions or attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I took"").
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no time frames like ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""I just want to die,"" ""I just want to kill myself"") without stating that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""die"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die.
   - No indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). The focus is on the difficulty of acting, not on rejecting the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""can't find a suitable way"" suggests consideration of methods but does not specify any, and it reflects uncertainty rather than a chosen plan.
   - Without an explicit method or preparation, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. The rules state to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and desires (e.g., ""I just want""), not past events.
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no phrases indicating an attempt was made, interrupted, or failed). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, which rules out 'Indicator' (as 'Indicator' requires a lack of genuine suicidal desire or explicit suicidal intent).
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior' (which requires explicit planning elements).
   - With no mention of past or recent initiated actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - This fits 'Ideation' because it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without a plan, method, or preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses distress: the user mentions being at a ""low point,"" having ""zero social skills,"" ""low self-esteem,"" and feeling ""lonely."" They seek ""help"" and ""ADVICE"" for improving their life, specifically about moving to another country and learning a second language. 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are implied by the ""low point"" and loneliness, but they are not severe or explicit. No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present. The user's stated desire is for practical advice and better living, not an end to life. Imminence of harmful intentions is absent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used. 
   - No clear desire to die is expressed; instead, the user focuses on seeking solutions for life challenges (e.g., moving countries). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant. 
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicide intent; the content leans toward general distress without personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The only ""plan"" discussed is about moving countries, which is life-oriented, not harmful.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and future-oriented questions about life changes, not past actions. 
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows distress (e.g., ""low point,"" loneliness) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, or past attempt. It aligns with 'Indicator' because the primary sentiment is general unhappiness and a call for help/advice, with no suicidal ideation present. Since there is no ambiguity about suicidal desire (it is absent), 'Indicator' is appropriate. Rules specify that if no desire to die is expressed, choose 'Indicator'.

   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the author themselves. 
   - Emotional indicators include hostility and frustration, but no hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or feelings of being a burden that suggest personal suicidal risk. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions by the author are present. 
   - The focus is entirely on another person's actions and a retaliatory wish, not on the author's own life or death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or a personal desire to die by the author. The death wish is directed outward, not inward.
   - The author does not express any suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or struggle with unwanted suicidal ideation for themselves. Thus, this leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No plan, method, or preparation for suicide by the author is mentioned or implied. The content is about a grievance, not personal suicidal behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references a past event (account ban) but no description of any self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. The ""die ASAP"" phrase is a curse toward another, not a statement of personal intent or action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress (anger) and abstractly mentions death, but it lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or attempt by the author. 
   - Since there is no indication of the author's own suicidal thoughts, ideation, behavior, or past attempt, and the death-related content is external, it fits the 'Indicator' category. 
   - Rules emphasize that suicide risk must correspond to the author, not others, and any ambiguity should default to 'Indicator'. Here, there is no ambiguity—no personal suicidal risk is present.

437,"I will kill my bullie. Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill  only yourself, but others. I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses a ""type of suicide"" that involves killing others, but this is an abstract reference, not a personal expression. The author's main focus is on homicidal intent towards a bully, with statements like ""I will kill her"" and asking for suggestions on how to murder her. There is no mention of the author wanting to die, commit suicide, or engage in self-harm. Emotional indicators include frustration and anger due to bullying, but not hopelessness or despair related to the author's own life. The desire expressed is to ""live my life in peace"" after killing the bully, indicating a wish to continue living. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are present; all planning elements are directed at homicide. The temporal context involves future intent to harm someone else, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions by the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No, the post does not explicitly mention suicide or self-harm for the author (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""I want to die""). The only suicide reference is abstract and not personal. The author expresses a clear desire to live (""to finally live my life in peace""), negating any suicidal intent. Unwanted suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No, there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide by the author. The discussion of methods (e.g., ""how to murder her"") is solely about harming another person, not self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions to commit homicide, not suicide. Past actions mentioned (""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"") relate to stopping bullying, not suicidal behavior. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content involves general distress about bullying and an abstract discussion of suicide, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or attempt by the author. The homicidal elements do not fall under suicide risk categories, which are strictly for the author's own risk. With no suicidal intent, and given the ambiguity rule (if unsure between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator), the post fits 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for Ideation (no desire to die), Behavior (no suicidal plan), or Attempt (no suicidal actions).

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""disappointment and failure.""
   - Specific plan/method: ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a concrete plan or method.
   - No references to past actions or preparations (e.g., no notes, acquired means).
   - Imminence: ""verge of suicide"" suggests urgency but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire: Explicit personal wish to die (e.g., ""want to end it all""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all"" are used. The author expresses a clear, current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes: ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies a specific plan or method, even if details are omitted. This elevates beyond mere ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all""). No description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried X""). Thus, not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal intent (rules out *Indicator*).
   - Presence of a likely plan/method (""know exactly what to do"") rules out *Ideation*.
   - No initiated lethal action (rules out *Attempt*).
   - Fits *Behavior*: Suicidal desire + implied plan/preparation.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""kill me"" and ""wanna die,"" which directly reference death or suicide. There are emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness (e.g., ""I just wanna die""). No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes), or past actions are mentioned. The desire is expressed in the present tense with no indication of imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The writer explicitly states a personal wish to die without expressing it as unwanted or distressing thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and ""wanna die,"" indicating a clear, personal desire to die. There is no negation or statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses solely on the desire to die, with no details on how or when it might occur. This absence of planning elements means it should not be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current desire (""I just wanna die"") but no past, recent, or future actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal act (e.g., no reference to a prior attempt or preparation), so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses an explicit, personal desire to die (""I just wanna die""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. It lacks any plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The absence of past actions or unwanted thoughts rules out 'Attempt' and 'Indicator'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the core element is suicidal thoughts without escalation to planning or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - **Key Elements:** The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, depression, and a desperate plea to be ""normal"" (specifically, to not be attracted to males and to resolve gender dysphoria). It references a history of trauma (""molested at 5 years""), chronic unhappiness, rejection, and isolation. Phrases like ""am tired of being unhappy,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" and ""please take all thoughts away"" indicate severe psychological pain.
   - **Suicide/Death Mentions:** No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no terms like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""die"").
   - **Emotional Indicators:** Strong hopelessness (""always had unhappy life""), despair (""am tired""), anhedonia (implied), and feelings of being trapped (""never struggle with that again"").
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation:** No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. The focus is on pleading for divine intervention to remove unwanted feelings/identity.
   - **Past Actions:** No description of past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - **Imminence:** No temporal indicators suggesting immediate risk (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - **Desire:** The writer expresses distress about their identity and mental state but does not state a desire to die. Instead, they explicitly plead for their suffering to be *removed* (""take all thoughts away,"" ""do a miracle"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Explicit Mention:** No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - **Desire to Die:** No statements expressing a wish to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). The core desire is for transformation (""make me straight,"" ""make me normal"").  
   - **Unwanted Thoughts:** While not suicidal, the plea to ""take all thoughts away"" and remove ""depression"" implies distress about their mental state, but these thoughts are not framed as suicidal.  
   - **Conclusion:** No explicit or implied suicidal intent. Leans toward **Indicator**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - No references to plans, methods (pills, weapons), or preparations (notes, goodbyes).  
   - **Conclusion:** Absence supports **Indicator/Ideation**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes chronic suffering (e.g., ""26 always had unhappy life"") but no past or recent suicidal actions.  
   - **Conclusion:** No evidence of **Attempt** or **Behavior**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post shows severe distress, depression, and hopelessness but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past action.  
   - Phrases like ""please take all thoughts away"" and ""I want to be normal"" reflect a plea for relief from suffering, not a wish to die.  
   - Ambiguity about suicidal desire is resolved per rules: When no explicit desire to die is present, **Indicator** is appropriate.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal"" in a rhetorical question (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), but this is framed as a general inquiry, not a personal statement.  
   - Expresses distress, hopelessness (""no change in sight""), and frustration about chronic pain, but **no explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past self-harm actions**. Focus is solely on the experience of physical pain and lack of improvement.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The word ""suicidal"" is used, but **not as a personal declaration** (e.g., ""I am suicidal""). The phrasing (""Anyone suicidal...?"") suggests a hypothetical or shared experience, not the author’s current intent.  
   - **No statement of personal desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I can’t go on"").  
   - **Answer: No explicit personal suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of tools, locations, substances, timelines, or preparations for suicide.  
   - **Answer: Absent**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing pain (8 months) but **no reference to past or recent suicidal actions**.  
   - **Answer: No initiated self-harm actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **distress and hopelessness** about physical pain but lacks:  
     - A personal expression of suicidal desire (rules out *Ideation*).  
     - Any plan/method (rules out *Behavior*).  
     - Any description of a past suicidal act (rules out *Attempt*).  
   - The use of ""suicidal"" is contextualized as a rhetorical question about suffering, not a self-declaration. This aligns with **'Indicator'**, which covers expressions of distress or abstract mentions of suicide without personal intent.  

**Conclusion**: Fits **Indicator** (distress without explicit personal suicidal desire).

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS: Key elements**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post includes phrases like ""give in to the nothingness that is death"" and references someone else's suicide (""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life""), but no direct mention of self-harm or specific methods for the author.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose,"" ""I'm over life""), despair, guilt, and feelings of isolation.
   - Plans/methods/preparations: ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies an endpoint but lacks specificity—no method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or concrete preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. It is vague and could be metaphorical.
   - Past actions: No description of any self-initiated suicidal actions by the author; only a reference to another person's suicide.
   - Imminence: ""One last record"" suggests a near-future intention but is not time-bound (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Stated desire: ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" expresses a genuine desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide? No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" for the author, but ""give in to the nothingness that is death"" conveys a clear personal desire to die.
   - Clear desire to die? Yes, the author anticipates death positively, indicating a wish not to be alive.
   - Unwanted thoughts? No negation or resistance to suicidal thoughts; the desire is affirmed.
   - Conclusion: Explicit intent is present, so not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method? None mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, locations).
   - Preparations? ""One last record"" is ambiguous—it could imply a final act before suicide but is not a direct preparation (e.g., no note, means, or goodbye). It is too vague to qualify as a plan.
   - Conclusion: No clear plan, method, or preparation, so not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current/future intentions (e.g., ""I am looking forward"" to death) but no past or recent actions by the author. The reference to another's suicide is not self-relevant.
   - No initiated lethal action: No description of a concrete, self-initiated event (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed).
   - Conclusion: Not 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Desire to die is explicitly stated, moving it out of 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire).
   - No plan, method, or preparation, so it cannot be 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - No past or recent suicidal action, so not 'Attempt'.
   - The core elements align with 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""I am looking forward to... death,"" ""I'm over life""), without specifics on how it would be carried out.
   - Ambiguity in ""One last record"" is insufficient for 'Behavior'; per rules, if unsure, choose 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die,"" indicating a personal desire for death. The context involves emotional distress (feeling belittled by the mother) and a stated motivation to cause pain through death. There are no references to specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight""). The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" is vague and does not specify a plan or means; it focuses on the outcome rather than actionable steps. No past suicidal actions or attempts are described. The desire to die appears genuine and is not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to die,"" which indicates clear personal suicidal intent. There is no negation (e.g., no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The vague reference to ""wherever it is"" does not constitute an explicit plan, method, or preparatory action. Without clear evidence of planning, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (e.g., ""I want to die""), but no past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned. There is no indication of an initiated, potentially lethal act, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die"") without any plan, method, or preparation. This fits 'Ideation' (desire to die with no specific plan). It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal intent is personal and explicit. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan or method, and 'Attempt' is ruled out due to the absence of any described action. Following the rule: if unsure about plan/method presence, default to 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide methods: ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" ""dead by the end of the week,"" ""I just want my death to come faster.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""I can't do anything right,"" ""useless,"" ""nuisance""), worthlessness, isolation.  
   - Specific plans/methods: Actively starving themselves (initiated action), references to hanging and guns as preferred methods.  
   - Preparations: Explicitly states, ""I've started to try and starve myself.""  
   - Imminence: ""dead by the end of the week.""  
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (e.g., ""I just want my death to come faster"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases like ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" ""want my death to come faster"" show unambiguous personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific methods (starving, hanging, gun) are mentioned.  
   - Preparation is confirmed: ""I've started to try and starve myself"" indicates an initiated action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a current/future intention (""dead by the end of the week"") and a past/recent action: ""started to try and starve myself"" (self-initiated, potentially lethal behavior).  
   - Starvation is an ongoing, concrete self-harm action with suicidal intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (Ideation/Behavior/Attempt).  
   - Method (starving) is specified, and preparation/action is underway (""started""), ruling out Ideation.  
   - The initiated starvation action is potentially lethal and ongoing, meeting the criteria for **Behavior** (active preparation/method implementation). It does not qualify as **Attempt** because the action (starvation) is gradual and not yet complete; no interruption/failure is described.

I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I just don't want to go on anymore""), anhedonia (""Nothing interests me anymore""), and despair (""My life has already been over"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: ""I plan my suicide every single day"" and ""the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going.""  
   - **Specific methods/plans**: Mentions ""using a pistol,"" ""an escape bag,"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up.""  
   - **No past/recent actions**: Describes daily planning but no initiated suicide attempt (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I did"").  
   - **Emphasis on distress**: The writer links suicide planning to ""escapism"" and expresses a desire to ""help myself,"" but the suicidal desire is explicit and current.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I plan my suicide"" and describes methods, confirming a current desire to die.

   - Explicit suicidal intent is present (""I've been suicidale all my life,"" ""I can't go on like this"").  
   - Specific methods are mentioned (rope, cutting, jumping, lying on road).  
   - The recent rope incident was initiated but stopped (""I failed because... I can't leave him alone"").  
   - Emotional distress (hopelessness, trauma, isolation) is pervasive.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""suicidale all my life,"" ""I can't go on,"" and descriptions of attempts confirm a persistent desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. The rope incident details a specific method (hanging) and physical preparation (tying the rope, standing on the chair).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The rope incident is a **recent, initiated action** (""I just stood on a chair...""). It was interrupted (due to thoughts of their friend), making it a concrete suicidal act that was started but not completed.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The recent rope incident qualifies as an **initiated, potentially lethal action** (standing on the chair with a noose), meeting the 'Attempt' criteria.  
   - Past attempts (e.g., jumping in front of a train) reinforce the pattern but are secondary to the **recently initiated action**.  
   - While current ideation/behavior is present, the description of a concrete, recent action takes precedence per the rules.

I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""if I die then I die"" and willingness to accept death at 50 or earlier.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""future is really grim"") and resignation (""not worth pushing my life further"").  
   - Explicitly states: ""I don’t have any plans to end it.""  
   - Action described: Stopped visiting doctors (passive neglect, not active self-harm).  
   - No references to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or active desire to die.  
   - Focuses on passive acceptance of death (""accept when my time has come"") without expressing a *desire* to hasten death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** for suicide described (e.g., no tools, locations, notes).  
   - Avoidance of doctors implies neglect but is not a suicidal method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing behavior (not visiting doctors) but **no initiated lethal action**.  
   - No reference to past/current suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress, hopelessness, and passive resignation about life/death but **no personal desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts**.  
   - Explicit negation of plans (""no plans to end it"") aligns with 'Indicator'.  
   - Avoidance of medical care reflects risk but is not a suicidal plan/action; it suggests ambivalence about life, not intent to die.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits 'Indicator' due to absence of active suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.

448,"I just fucking hate myself. The title really says it all. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Self-hatred (""hate myself""), hopelessness (""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy""), worthlessness (""coward,"" inability to form relationships).
   - References a method (""starve myself""), but frames it as a hypothetical weight-loss solution due to thyroid issues, not as a suicidal plan. No specific suicide plan, preparation, or timeline is stated.
   - Explicitly negates acting on suicidal thoughts (""too much of a coward to kill myself""), indicating a lack of current intent to act.
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no attempt initiated).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
   - **Yes**, it expresses a desire to die (via ""kill myself""), but this is immediately negated by the author’s self-described inability to act (""too much of a coward""). The overall sentiment focuses on distress about having these thoughts without a current desire to carry them out.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No** specific suicidal plan, method, or preparation is described. The mention of ""starve myself"" is contextualized as a weight-loss struggle (due to thyroid issues), not as a suicide method. No tools, locations, or suicide-specific preparations are indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., self-loathing, suicidal ideation) but **no past or recent concrete suicidal actions**. The reference to ""starve myself"" is hypothetical/future-oriented for weight loss, not suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") but lacks a plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The author explicitly disavows acting on these thoughts (""too much of a coward""), emphasizing distress rather than intent. The starvation reference is unrelated to suicide planning.  
   - This fits **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die is expressed, but without a plan/preparation. The self-negation reinforces that the core issue is ideation (unwanted thoughts) rather than imminent risk (Behavior/Attempt).  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal intent is explicitly stated (though negated), moving beyond general distress.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan, method, or initiated action is described.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses helping friends who are struggling and ""thinking about suicide,"" but all references to suicide are framed as advice for supporting *others*.  
   - The author shares general observations (e.g., ""people's first intuition when trying to help a friend"") and recommendations (e.g., hugs, support), not personal experiences.  
   - No mentions of death/dying, self-harm, emotional distress, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions **by the author**.  
   - Focus is entirely on societal advice (""help a friend""), not the author’s own state.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned only in the context of hypothetical friends (""a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide"").  
   - **No personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or distress expressed by the author**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No plan, method, or preparation described **for the author**. References to suicide are abstract and third-person.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent actions initiated by the author. The post is purely advisory.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly (""thinking about suicide"" in others) and expresses general advice about support, but **lacks any personal expression of desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or action by the author**.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Abstract discussion of suicide (in others) + focus on general distress/support strategies without personal suicidal intent.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: hopelessness (""no reason to live,"" ""waste of life""), despair (""end to me""), isolation (""no one anymore""), and self-blame (""bad karma"").  
   - Explicit suicidal desire: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""becoming content with that,"" and ""drive me further to killing myself.""  
   - Preparations: Stopped medication, heavy drinking, and depletion of Ativan (a medication used for anxiety).  
   - No specific suicide method, plan (e.g., tools/location), or timeline stated.  
   - Past actions: None described; focuses on current thoughts and behaviors (drinking, ceasing meds).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing myself,"" ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" and ""content with that"" express personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/plan**: Mentions general self-destructive behaviors (drinking, stopping meds) but no concrete suicide plan (e.g., ""I will use X method at Y place"").  
   - Preparations like discontinuing medication and drinking may indirectly facilitate harm but lack explicit ties to a suicide method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional state and behaviors (drinking, off meds).  
   - **No initiated lethal action**: No mention of past/current suicide attempts (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""suicide is purpose,"" ""killing myself"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation tied to suicide → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No past/recent lethal action → Rules out *Attempt*.

If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific method: ""drowning yourself"" and elaborates on it (""slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean"").  
   - Expresses personal desire: ""best option for me,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""peaceful,"" and explicitly states intent to act conditionally (""If I get kicked out... I might go and do that"").  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are rationalized as ""peaceful"" and ""smooth.""  
   - No reference to past actions, only future intent under a specific trigger.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""drowning yourself"" and ""guaranteed death"" directly imply suicidal intent. The author personalizes it (""best option for me"").  
   - **No** indication of distress about *unwanted* thoughts; the tone is accepting/planning-oriented.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (drowning) is named and described in detail (""sinking to the bottom of the ocean""). Location (""ocean"") is implied.  
   - Preparations are conditional (""if I get kicked out"") but method is explicitly selected.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intent** (""I might go and do that"") contingent on an event (getting kicked out).  
   - **No** mention of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and method details exceed abstract distress.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Method (drowning) and location (ocean) are specified, moving beyond mere desire.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Behavior**: Clear personal desire + specific method/location (""drowning,"" ""ocean"") + conditional preparation (""might go and do that"").  
   - Uncertainty rule: Method is explicit, so **'Behavior'** over 'Ideation'.

We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""I don't see what there is to live for,"" ""it has all been for nothing""), despair (""I don't even feel alive""), and anhedonia (""I just feel like I am ‘existing'"").  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"" and ""I want out.""  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""Death seems a better option to me than living in this world.""  
   - No specific method, plan, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, notes) is mentioned.  
   - No reference to past/current actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  
   - Temporal context focuses on ongoing distress and future resignation (""I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this""), not imminent action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""suicide is appropriate now,"" ""I want out,"" and ""Death seems a better option."" The author personally expresses a desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicide/death is explicitly desired, there is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses current/future despair but describes **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The author explicitly desires death/suicide (e.g., ""suicide is appropriate now""), moving beyond distress alone → **Ideation**.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopeful tone due to Star Wars content (""reason not to kill myself,"" ""all I've ever wanted""), but acknowledges suicidal ideation.
   - Plans/methods: No specific method, tool, location, or preparation described. ""Suicide attempts"" is referenced generally but not as an active plan.
   - Past actions: No description of initiated self-harm or past attempts.
   - Imminence: Intentions are postponed (""postpone for the next decade""), not immediate.
   - Desire: Expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are postponed/unwanted due to a new motivation (Star Wars).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" confirm personal suicidal ideation.
   - Desire to die: Implied in ""suicide attempts,"" but actively negated by the reason to postpone (""not to kill myself"").
   - Unwanted thoughts: The postponement and hopeful tone indicate distress about suicidal urges but no current desire to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.
   - ""Suicide attempts"" is hypothetical/future-oriented with no concrete details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on future intentions (""postpone for the next decade""), not past actions.
   - No description of initiated self-harm (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (""kill myself,"" ""suicide attempts""), satisfying the threshold for **'Ideation'**.
   - However, the lack of a specific plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The postponement and hopeful context reinforce that this is ideation (desire/thoughts without active planning).
   - No past/current initiated lethal action (rules out 'Attempt').
   - Not 'Indicator' because the author personally expresses suicidal desire, even if conflicted.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""no will to live,"" ""tired of living,"" ""can't take it anymore""), despair (""going nowhere in life""), and self-loathing (""worthless loser"").  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I just want to **end it all**"" directly signals a personal desire to die.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""tomorrow""), or preparations (e.g., ""bought a rope"") are mentioned.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described.  
   - The focus is on the *desire* to escape life due to overwhelming distress, not on actionable steps or historical behaviors.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""End it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide. The phrase ""tired of living"" reinforces a genuine wish to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory acts (e.g., writing notes) are referenced. General despair dominates without concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and a persistent desire to die but **no initiated actions** (past or present).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (""end it all"") and suicidal thoughts rooted in hopelessness.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal intent is explicit and personal (not abstract/unwanted thoughts).  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, or descriptions of past/current lethal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post contains strong emotional distress, including feelings of worthlessness (""I'm one hell of a disappointment,"" ""I have no value""), self-loathing (""useless bitch,"" ""stupid bitch,"" ""cunt""), and hopelessness (""I'm the worst of all human beings"").
   - It explicitly mentions suicide: ""I'm going to kill myself.""
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or timelines).
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are referenced; the focus is on current feelings and future intention.
   - The desire to die is expressed directly and personally, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, this expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no negation (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on this"").
   - This rules out 'Indicator' as the suicidal desire is explicit and not framed as unwanted distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" implies intent but lacks concrete details about a plan.
   - Since no plan/method is present, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going to kill myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started or completed).
   - Without evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"") places this beyond 'Indicator', which requires the absence of personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires a planning element).
   - With no description of past or recent actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die or engage in suicide but lacks any indication of a plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Key elements: Expresses recurring suicidal feelings (""Feel like dying again""), describes recent improvement in mood followed by relapse into severe distress (""back to feeling like shit""), hopelessness (""There's no end to anything""), and perceived burden (""stress out my manager"").

   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe distress: sleep deprivation (only 1 hour/night), paranoia (""everyone is in on it but me""), feeling tortured by neighbors/landlord, recent MS diagnosis, financial helplessness (""no money to just walk out""), and hopelessness (""I don’t know what options I have left"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators: despair (""this is hell""), exhaustion (""I’m so tired""), helplessness, and persecution delusions.  
   - Desires expressed: ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" – **focused on escaping circumstances, not ending life**.  
   - **No temporal urgency** (e.g., ""tonight"") or references to past/planned actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""

   - Expressions like ""leave this place"" imply escape, **not suicide**.  
   - Without suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt, this aligns with **'Indicator'** (general distress without current suicidal intent).

458,"My parents don't love me. I have nobody :). Possible suicide date is in July. Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends. I'll never be a real woman. I don't know why I cling onto ""hope"". I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes emotional distress indicators: feelings of being unloved (""My parents don't love me""), isolation (""I have nobody""), hopelessness (""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope'""), and identity crisis (""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't even know who I am anymore"").
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""Possible suicide date is in July"" directly references a suicidal plan with a specific timeframe.
   - Ambivalence about acting on suicidal thoughts: ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends"" indicates internal conflict, but it does not negate the desire to die; it shows consideration of suicide influenced by friends.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned beyond the date.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""in July""), indicating planning but no imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The author expresses a personal struggle with suicidal thoughts, but the desire to die is implied through the consideration of a suicide date.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" indicating a personal connection to suicidal intent.
   - The phrase ""Possible suicide date"" and the debate around it (""I'm fucking debating it"") express a genuine, though conflicted, desire to die, as the author is contemplating setting a date for suicide. It is not stated as unwanted thoughts (e.g., no language like ""I don't want these thoughts"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific plan element is present: the mention of a ""suicide date in July"" constitutes a preparation or planning step, as it sets a timeline for a potential suicidal act. This goes beyond mere ideation.
   - However, no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed. The date alone is sufficient for 'Behavior' under the definition, which includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""in July"") with no indication of past or recent initiated actions. The debate suggests consideration but no execution.
   - There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was started or completed (e.g., no reference to an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (""suicide date"") and a planning element (the date) moves this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire to die) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan). The date represents a preparatory step, fitting 'Behavior.'
   - Despite the ambivalence (""debating it""), the plan is explicitly mentioned, so 'Behavior' is appropriate. If the plan were absent, it would be 'Ideation,' but the date constitutes a plan element.
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no action was initiated.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating explicit references to suicide. Emotional indicators include sadness, hopelessness (e.g., ""I will always be a loser,"" ""never make friends""), and distress (""It hurts so much""). However, it explicitly negates any intent to act, stating, ""I will probably never kill myself"" due to religious beliefs, and expresses hope for improvement (""I can only hope that my life will get better""). There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" but the writer directly states they do not want to act on these thoughts (""I will probably never kill myself"") because it conflicts with their religious values. The primary sentiment is distress about having these thoughts, not a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The suicidal thoughts are described passively without any planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. The phrase ""never kill myself"" is a future-oriented negation of intent, not an action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts, but these are explicitly framed as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die (due to religious reasons and hope for improvement). This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress or abstract discussions of suicide without a clear, current desire to die. It does not meet 'Ideation' because the writer negates the desire to act, and there is no plan/method for 'Behavior' or initiated action for 'Attempt'.

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" (explicit suicidal intent with temporal specificity).  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""downward spiral""), guilt (""failing everyone""), exhaustion (""can't do another year"").  
   - Specific preparation: ""I’ve made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (explicit reference to suicide notes as preparations).  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, hanging) mentioned, but timing (""new year's eve"") and preparations (notes) are clear.  
   - No description of past or recent *initiated* lethal actions (notes are preparatory, not actions like taking pills).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""ending it all"" is a direct phrase implying suicide. Desire is unambiguously stated without negation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: ""new year's eve"" indicates a temporal plan.  
   - Yes: ""made 3 other suicide notes... this is the one"" confirms concrete preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Future intention: Plan to act on New Year’s Eve.  
   - Past actions: Only writing notes (preparatory behavior), not a concrete lethal act (e.g., ingestion, jumping).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/preparation → **Behavior**.  
   - Suicide notes are preparations, not an initiated lethal action → Not **Attempt**.  
   - Plan/timing (""new year's eve"") and notes exceed **Ideation** threshold.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions a specific past action: ""I tried to cut myself last night."" This indicates self-harm initiated during a breakdown, while drunk. The reason given is to ""feel something real,"" not to die. Emotional distress is evident (""very bad night,"" ""breakdown""), but there is no explicit desire for death or suicide. The author states they've ""never done it or wanted to do it before,"" framing this as an isolated incident without prior ideation or intent. No suicide-related terms (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"") are used, and no plan, method, or preparation for suicide is described for the future. The action is past (""last night"") and not described as lethal or intended to be lethal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, death, or a desire to die. The phrase ""tried to cut myself"" relates to self-harm for sensory reasons (""wanted to feel something real""), not suicide. There is no expression of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted). Thus, this leans toward 'Indicator' due to the lack of personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (cutting) is mentioned, but only in the context of a past action, not as part of a current or future plan for suicide. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described for ongoing or imminent suicide risk. Since the method is tied to a non-suicidal past event and no suicidal planning is indicated, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The action (""tried to cut myself"") occurred in the past (""last night"") and is described as self-initiated. However, the context (drunk, breakdown, wanting to ""feel something real"") suggests non-suicidal self-injury rather than a suicide attempt. Cutting is not inherently described as potentially lethal (e.g., no details on severity or intent to die), and the author emphasizes it was unwanted and out of character. As this lacks suicidal intent, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. No current or future suicidal actions are indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress and a past self-harm incident but lacks a clear, personal desire to die or explicit suicidal thoughts. Non-suicidal self-injury like this, without suicidal intent, falls under 'Indicator' as it signals emotional turmoil but not active suicide risk. 'Ideation' is not applicable as there are no suicidal thoughts. 'Behavior' requires suicidal planning, which is absent. 'Attempt' is for potentially lethal suicidal actions, which this is not, due to the stated non-suicidal intent. Ambiguity about suicidal desire is resolved in favor of 'Indicator' per the guidelines.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit mention of suicide: ""plan to kill myself"".
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""have nothing and no one""), lack of purpose (""no purpose to live"").
    - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).
    - No reference to past actions or attempts.
    - Temporal context: Future intention (""plan to""), no immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").
    - Desire to die is explicit and personal (question ""Why shouldn't I?"" implies consideration of acting).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes: ""plan to kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - No indication of unwanted thoughts (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to act"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., ""bought a rope"") described. General planning (""plan to"") lacks concrete details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
    - Describes future intent (""plan to"") but no past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - Explicit desire to die (""plan to kill myself"") and hopelessness confirm **Ideation**.
    - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**. No past/initiated action rules out **Attempt**. Genuine suicidal desire rules out **Indicator**.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly uses the phrase ""killing yourself soon,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Nobodyll do shit"") and resignation (""I have no worries of being stopped"").  
   - The author contemplates logistics (informing others vs. surprising them) but mentions **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes, weapons).  
   - Focus is on future intent (""will be killing yourself soon""), with no description of past/initiated actions.  
   - The desire to die is implicit in the logistical planning; no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to"") is present.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing yourself soon"" and context imply personal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) is mentioned. The discussion about ""heads up"" is logistical but not a concrete plan/method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intention (""soon"") with **no past/recent initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""killing yourself soon"") places this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No described past/recent suicidal action rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times (""I think I'll kill myself tonight,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad"") and specifies a method (""hang myself"") and location (""at the woods""). It includes emotional distress (""I'm so fucking tired of everything"") and imminence (""tonight""). There is also a preparatory element (""I'll play my favorite music ever""). No past actions are described; it focuses on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" expressing a clear, personal desire to die with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (""hang myself"") and location (""at the woods"") are mentioned, indicating a plan. The reference to playing music could imply preparation, but the explicit method and location are sufficient to indicate planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is about planned behavior, not completed or attempted actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a specific method and plan (hanging in the woods) elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which would lack such details). Since no past or recent initiated action is described, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal ideation combined with a plan/method.

I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way. I want to kill myself, already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching. Already started to cancel friendships.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense loneliness and despair (""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily with loneliness""). 
    - Key elements: Explicit suicidal desire (""I want to kill myself""), a specific plan element (""set a date 2 weeks ago""), and preparations (""started to cancel friendships""). 
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, but setting a date and severing ties are clear preparatory actions. 
    - Temporal context: The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""approaching"" the set date), with no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of an actual overdose or self-harm incident). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes, the post directly states, ""I want to kill myself,"" confirming a personal desire to die. There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Plan/preparation elements are present: A specific timeline (""set a date 2 weeks ago"") and active steps to isolate (""cancel friendships""). Though no method is specified, setting a date and cutting ties constitute explicit preparations. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes future intent (approaching the set date) and preparatory actions (canceling friendships), but no past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'. 
    - Preparations (setting a date, canceling friendships) go beyond mere thoughts, ruling out 'Ideation'. 
    - No concrete, initiated lethal action (e.g., an overdose) is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 
    - The combination of explicit suicidal desire with a plan (date) and preparations (canceling ties) fits 'Behavior'.

Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" directly, but frames them in the context of avoidance (e.g., ""i have to [waste time] so i dont kill myself""). It expresses emotional distress like hopelessness (""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""i dont like this shithole""), and anhedonia (""i dont like to sleep all day i dont like to waste time but i have to""). The question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look"" is abstract and philosophical, not a personal declaration of intent. There are no mentions of specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. No past suicidal actions are described. The writer indicates they are taking actions to prevent self-harm, suggesting the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Imminence is not indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention: Yes, ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are used.
   - Clear desire to die: No. The phrase ""so i dont kill myself"" explicitly negates a current desire to act, indicating resistance to suicidal thoughts. The question about suicide is general and does not express a personal wish to die.
   - Unwanted thoughts: Yes, the writer implies suicidal thoughts are present but states they are actively avoiding acting on them. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method/preparation: No. There is no mention of a plan, means, tools, location, or preparatory actions (e.g., no notes, acquiring items). The focus is on avoidance rather than planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past/future intention: The post describes current distress and avoidance behaviors but no past, recent, or future suicidal actions. The reference to suicide is hypothetical or general, not tied to a specific time or action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and abstract discussion of suicide, with suicidal thoughts explicitly resisted through avoidance behaviors. This fits 'Indicator' (distress or unwanted thoughts without a clear, current personal desire to die). It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit, unresisted desire to die; the thoughts are countered by preventive actions. No plan or method suggests 'Behavior' is inappropriate, and no past action indicates 'Attempt' does not apply. Ambiguity about desire leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" twice, indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (implied by the repetition) and self-perceived inability to act (""too much of a coward"").  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, locations, tools, or past actions.  
   - The phrase ""too much of a coward to do it"" explicitly negates any current intent or capability to act on the desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""I want to die"" is a direct personal expression of a desire to die.  
   - However, the writer explicitly states they *cannot* act on this desire due to fear (""coward""), indicating the thoughts are unwanted in terms of action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is a **desire to die** (""I want to die""), which typically suggests 'Ideation'.  
   - However, the explicit negation of action (""too much of a coward to do it"") frames the suicidal thoughts as **unwanted/distressing but not actionable**, aligning more closely with 'Indicator' (distress about suicidal thoughts without current intent/ability to act).  
   - Since the writer does not express a plan, method, or preparation—and actively disclaims the ability to act—this falls under **'Indicator'** per the rule: *""If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted/not acted upon, lean toward Indicator.""*

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""throw myself off a bridge"" and ""this is just a way of dying.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can't take it""), anhedonia (""tired of everything""), and feeling like a burden (""don't have the confidence to say a word"").  
   - Specific plan/method: ""Throw myself off a bridge"" is a concrete method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I'm gonna commit suicide,"" ""gonna twist my dick off,"" ""die of blood loss.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress implied by inability to get a boner, but focus is on action.  
   - Specific method/preparation: Describes a method (""twist my dick off"") and outcome (""die of blood loss"").  
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""gonna,"" ""gonna wait it off"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""commit suicide,"" ""die of blood loss"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" due to worsening disease, which refers to death from illness, not self-inflicted harm. There are no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I am lonely and have no reason to live""), despair (""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years""), and anhedonia (lack of reason to live).
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or references to past suicidal actions are present.
   - The phrase ""Sayonara"" (meaning ""goodbye"") is ambiguous but, in context, appears related to the disease progression rather than imminent suicide (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses distress about their condition and a lack of purpose, but not a clear, personal desire to die by suicide. The death described is passive (from disease), not active.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - The desire expressed (""I have no reason to live"") suggests hopelessness but not an explicit wish to die by suicide; it focuses on enduring suffering from illness.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there's no indication they are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses a future event (""I will eventually die"") related to disease, not a personal intention or action. No past or recent suicidal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress (pain, depression, loneliness, hopelessness) and abstractly references death from illness, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or action.
   - Ambiguity exists with phrases like ""no reason to live,"" but this leans toward distress rather than explicit suicidal ideation. Per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.
   - No elements align with 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no initiated action).

Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"" and the ever so disappointing question of ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" to which the answer is always no. This is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop. I won't like start being healthy or chasing serotonin or whatever, I'll just try to be more considerate next time. I'll still be suicidal lol",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses envy towards people who have died or committed suicide, with thoughts like ""Why can't that be me?"" and ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"". It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness and self-criticism (e.g., ""turning me into a bad person""). The author explicitly states ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts. There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means). No past or recent suicidal actions are described; all content relates to current thoughts and feelings. The desire to die is present, but the author also expresses guilt about these thoughts and a need to stop the envious thinking, though not the suicidal ideation itself.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide"" and ""killing yourself"" in the context of the author's own thoughts. It expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""Why can't that be me?"" and the affirmation ""I'll still be suicidal."" While there is some acknowledgment that the thoughts are ""wrong and disgusting,"" this resistance is directed at the envy aspect, not at negating the underlying desire to die. The suicidal intent is personal and current, so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The references to suicide are abstract and general (e.g., ""killing yourself""), with no details on how, when, or where it might be carried out. The absence of any plan or preparation means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses current thoughts and feelings, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no initiated attempts, interruptions, or failures). The mention of others' deaths is not related to the author's own actions. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows a clear personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'll still be suicidal""), placing it above 'Indicator', which requires no such desire. However, the lack of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. Since no concrete suicidal actions are described, 'Attempt' is ruled out. The content fits 'Ideation' best, as it centers on suicidal thoughts without actionable plans.

472,"Idk how to word this without sounding dumb. Am I the only one who wants to die but is still afraid of stupid little things like going to hell or something? Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""wants to die"" and acknowledges that fear of hell is ""one of the only things keeping me alive.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm probably [going to hell] anyways""), isolation, and distress about being unable to discuss feelings.  
   - **No mention** of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes), or past actions related to suicide.  
   - The desire to die is present but contradicted by fear (""afraid of stupid little things like going to hell""), and the writer explicitly states this fear is preventing action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""wants to die"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive.  
   - **No explicit negation of desire**: The writer does not say they *do not want* these thoughts; instead, they frame fear as a barrier.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned. The focus is on internal conflict (fear of consequences) rather than actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). References to past actions (""have done some bad shit"") are unrelated to suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""wants to die"") confirms suicidal intent, placing it above *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/current suicidal actions**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The presence of a barrier (fear of hell) does not negate the desire to die; it aligns with *Ideation* (thoughts without plan/action).

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal thoughts: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""crushed by stress,"" ""no motivation""), isolation (""no friends,"" friend becoming distant), anxiety, and feeling unheard.  
   - Protective factor: Little brother is the stated reason for staying alive.  
   - No explicit plan, method, preparation, or timeline for suicide.  
   - Focus is on distress and inability to cope, not active intent to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""thought of killing myself"" (past tense).  
   - **But** the writer negates desire to act: ""I always thought of my little brother"" (protective factor), and ""he is the only reason I'm alive right now."" No current expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None**. No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly **past** (2019/pandemic).  
   - No description of any initiated suicidal action (past or present).  
   - Current language emphasizes distress, not intent: ""I need help,"" ""I don’t know how long I can cope.""  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicidal thoughts are mentioned, but they are framed as **unwanted/halted by a protective factor** and lack current desire.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No initiated action → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Current language expresses distress/hopelessness but **no active personal desire to die**. Suicidal thoughts are historical and explicitly counteracted.  
   - Ambiguity about genuine *current* desire → **Leans toward Indicator** per rules.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"").  
   - It includes a request for information on methods (""Where can I find out how to die""), implying active planning.  
   - There is no mention of past actions, unwanted thoughts, or emotional distress without suicidal intent.  
   - The indifference to suffering (""slow or painful or both"") underscores strong intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I just want to definitely die"" is a direct, personal expression of desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Seeking information on ""how to die"" constitutes active preparation to identify a method, even if no specific tool/location is named yet.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The focus is on future intent and preparation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Preparation is present** (seeking methods) → Elevates beyond *Ideation* to *Behavior*.  
   - No concrete past/ongoing lethal action → Rules out *Attempt*.

475,"It Never Quite Goes Away. I stick around for other people, but not because I want to be alive. It's not just that I don't see a future for myself, I just don't really want one either. It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: Explicit mentions include ""will to die,"" ""if I do attempt again,"" and ""I'm not going to fail."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""don't see a future,"" ""don't want one""), feeling like a burden (""trying... to not hurt my loved ones""), and indifference toward others. Specific plans are implied (""I've made enough plans,"" ""if I do it, it'll be at least a few months out""). Past suicidal action is explicitly stated (""if I do attempt again""). Imminence is delayed (""a few months out""). The writer expresses a persistent desire not to be alive (""not because I want to be alive"") and references a prior attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""will to die,"" ""if I do attempt,"" and ""if I do it"" directly reference suicidal intent. The desire to die is personal and current (e.g., ""I'm tired of fighting to heal"" to avoid hurting others, but ""I just don't care""). The writer does not negate or express unwanted thoughts; instead, they reaffirm intent (""I'm not going to fail"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - Yes: ""I've made enough plans"" indicates concrete preparations. ""If I do attempt again"" implies a method (though unspecified) and confidence in success (""not going to fail""). This satisfies planning/preparation criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Past action: The phrase ""attempt again"" confirms a prior concrete, self-initiated suicidal act (even if details are sparse). Current/future intent is also present (""if I do attempt""), but the past attempt is explicitly described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post exceeds 'Indicator' due to explicit personal desire to die. It surpasses 'Ideation' due to mentions of plans and preparations. It is not solely 'Behavior' because a past attempt (""attempt again"") is disclosed. Per the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past potentially lethal action is described, even alongside current ideation/behavior. The writer confirms a concrete prior action, making 'Attempt' the correct category.

I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent: ""how and when I'm going to take my life"" and ""use any method aside from a gun to the head.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I don't want any more chances""), despair (""I've fucked up everything""), and desire for relief (""I just want the pain to stop"").  
   - Specific methods are discussed: ""gun to the head"" and ""grab a kitchen knife.""  
   - Preparations/timeline: A 480-day wait for the gun plan, but immediate temptation to use a knife.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""take my life"" and ""use any method aside from a gun."" The author expresses a clear, current desire to die (e.g., ""I don't want any more chances"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Two specific methods are named (""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife""), and a timeline is implied (""480 days"" for the gun, but immediate temptation for the knife).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intentions (""I'm going to take my life,"" ""grab a kitchen knife""). No mention of past/initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts include specific methods (gun/knife) and planning elements (timeline), moving beyond mere desire.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/recent initiated action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but frames it as a general question about others' experiences. 
   - Expresses distress: hopelessness (""can't concentrate""), guilt (""all I failed to do""), and isolation (""everyone focused on careers""). 
   - Explicitly states a desire to live (""genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"") and seeks solutions (inpatient care, medication). 
   - No references to death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Temporal language (""trying,"" ""figure out steps"") focuses on future recovery.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Suicide is mentioned indirectly (""anyone having thoughts of suicide""), but not as a personal desire. 
   - The writer actively *negates* suicidal intent by emphasizing efforts to live and seek help. 
   - Leans strongly toward 'Indicator' due to lack of personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Distress and suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but framed as unwanted (seeking help to ""live""). 
   - No personal expression of desire to die, plan, or behavior. Dominant theme is active pursuit of recovery. 
   - Fits 'Indicator': distress + suicidal thoughts mentioned abstractly/indirectly, with explicit rejection of intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""No future""), despair (""Everyday is the same""), and low self-worth (""I'm 40 and unemployed""). It explicitly mentions suicide: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday."" A specific method is indicated with ""Bridge,"" implying jumping from a bridge. There is a temporal element with ""on Monday,"" showing future intent. No past actions or preparations are described, and the desire to die is clear and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself,"" expressing a clear personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""Bridge""), and there is a plan with a timeline (""on Monday""). No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note) are noted, but the method and temporal plan are sufficient to indicate planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""going to try on Monday"") but no past or recent initiated actions. It is not describing an event that has already occurred or been attempted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a specific method (""Bridge"") and plan (""on Monday"") elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method). Since no action has been initiated, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. This fits 'Behavior' due to the suicidal intent combined with a method and plan.

   - Emotional indicators: Distress (""so hard,"" ""hardest decisions""), fixation (""can't get this girl out of my head"").
   - Plan/method: ""hangman's noose"" (method), ""overcame a big hurdle"" (preparation), ensuring mother's stability post-suicide (logistical planning).
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""kms,"" ""when I do it"").
   - No past/initiated actions: Describes *preparations*, not a concrete attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" but later clarifies, ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore.""  
   - Strong emotional distress is evident: hopelessness (""adulthood is all downhill""), worthlessness (""I’m a failure""), anxiety, and anhedonia (""no passions or desires"").  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions.  
   - The writer explicitly negates the desire to die, framing their distress as a wish to escape their current self/state.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""I want to die"" are present, but the writer directly states they *do not* want to die (""I don't want to die""). The suicidal thought is framed as unwanted/unacted-upon.  
   - **Conclusion**: Leans toward 'Indicator' due to explicit negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Absence of plan/method supports 'Indicator' or 'Ideation', but negation of desire is key.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes chronic distress (e.g., ""haven’t been happy in 2 years"") but **no mention of past/current suicidal actions**.  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of initiated lethal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") but explicitly rejects the desire to act on them (""I don’t want to die"").  
   - Distress is centered on hopelessness and identity struggles, not active suicidal intent.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of past/recent suicidal actions → rules out 'Attempt'.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post details multiple past suicide attempts: overdose at 15, firearm incident at 21, hanging attempt recently.  
   - Describes current preparation (""exit bag set up"") and a recent initiated action (turning on gas valve, then stopping due to panic).  
   - Expresses explicit suicidal desire (""desire to die,"" ""this is really it"") alongside fear, loneliness, and exhaustion.  
   - Mentions specific methods (aspirin, gun, hanging, exit bag/gas) and preparations (research, acquiring tools, testing methods).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Explicitly references personal suicide attempts and current suicidal intent (e.g., ""I have an exit bag set up,"" ""desire to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (exit bag/gas) and preparations (""done it perfectly"") are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past attempts** (aspirin, gun, hanging) as concrete, potentially lethal actions.  
   - **Recent initiated action**: Turning on the gas valve for the exit bag (a potentially lethal act), though aborted. Rules specify that interrupted/stopped actions qualify as 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past actions (aspirin/gun/hanging) are unambiguous suicide attempts.  
   - The recent gas valve incident is a **self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (turning on gas), meeting the 'Attempt' threshold despite being halted.  
   - 'Attempt' supersedes current 'Behavior' (exit bag setup) or 'Ideation' per rules.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""end my life,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile""), despair, feeling like a burden (""I'm a garbage person,"" ""leech who will never accomplish anything,"" and the belief that ending their life would benefit themselves and others).
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - No references to past actions, such as a previous suicide attempt or self-harm.
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the language is general.
   - The writer expresses a personal desire to die (""should just end my life"") without indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die for personal and others' benefit.
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means).
   - With desire expressed but no plan/method/preparation, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not a past event.
   - No description of a specific, initiated suicidal action (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""should just end my life""), moving it out of 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - It lacks any plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. The rule states: if unsure about plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent action is described, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die without specifics on how or when.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself""), expressions of hopelessness (""I don't see a reason to live""), and general despair (""Life sucks"").
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.
   - The phrase ""I'm about to"" indicates imminent intent but does not specify a timeframe or describe any concrete actions taken.
   - The writer expresses a clear personal desire to die, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die through ""I'm about to kill myself"" and ""I don't see a reason to live.""
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, hanging), tool, substance, or location is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye) are present.
   - Since there is a desire to die but no plan, method, or preparation indicated, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm about to"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of taking pills or self-harming).
   - It does not refer to any concrete, potentially lethal actions that were started, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - With no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - As no past or recent initiated action is described, it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' because it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without specific plans or actions.

485,"I'm done. I'm too pissed, don't even want to feel good anymore, just gonna embrace the pain and face death. I'm now gonna start working out until i die or pass out, i'll be back in 12 hours if i survived to tell you how it went, if not, well, you know what happened.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""face death,"" ""until i die,"" and implies death as an outcome with ""if not, well, you know what happened."" Emotional indicators include anger (""I'm too pissed""), hopelessness (""don't even want to feel good anymore""), and acceptance of suffering (""embrace the pain""). A specific method is described: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is a self-injurious behavior intended to cause death. Preparations are implied through immediate action (""I'm now gonna start working out""). Temporal context shows imminence: the action starts now, with a 12-hour timeline for potential death. The writer's desire is not negated; they are embracing death as a possible outcome.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it expresses a personal willingness to face death (e.g., ""embrace the pain and face death,"" ""until i die""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the writer is actively engaging with the risk of death. This goes beyond abstract distress, indicating a genuine, current personal desire to not be alive, so it is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is a concrete means to achieve death. The writer also indicates immediate initiation of this method (""I'm now gonna start""), showing preparation and action. This moves beyond mere thoughts to behavior involving a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current/future intention with immediate initiation: the writer is starting the action at the time of posting. It details a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (excessive exercise to the point of death) that is underway, as evidenced by the 12-hour countdown and the conditional ""if i survived."" This is not a past event but a real-time, initiated action that could result in death, fitting 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""face death,"" ""until i die"") and a specific method, so it is not 'Indicator' or 'Ideation'. The action is being initiated now, not just planned, so it is not 'Behavior'. The description of an ongoing, potentially lethal self-initiated action (""start working out until i die"") with a clear timeline aligns with 'Attempt', as it involves a concrete, life-threatening act in progress.

If I wait 10 years I'll never be able to retire. but why should I save up so much money only leaving myself enough to get by if I plan to be dead long before I retire. I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""contemplated suicide for years"" and ""I know I am going to do it,"" indicating a personal history of suicidal thoughts and a current desire to die. Phrases like ""I plan to be dead long before I retire"" reinforce a genuine wish to die, though it is framed in a future context (""maybe in my 20's or 30's""). 
   - Emotional indicators include distress about life planning (retirement conflict) but no explicit hopelessness or despair beyond the suicidal intent. 
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The retirement plan discussion is unrelated to suicide preparation. 
   - There are no references to past actions or attempts; only contemplation (""contemplated"") is described. 
   - The timeline is not imminent (""maybe in my 20's or 30's""), and the desire to die is stated as a future intention without immediacy. 
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""suicide"" and ""I know I am going to do it,"" confirming a personal and explicit desire to die. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. The future timing (""in my 20's or 30's"") is vague and not tied to a concrete plan. Without any plan/method elements, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post references past contemplation (""contemplated suicide for years"") but no initiated actions. The future intention (""I am going to do it"") lacks evidence of any recent or past lethal action. Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal ideation), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire). 
   - However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. 
   - The mention of past contemplation is about thoughts, not actions, so it does not elevate to 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post expresses a desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no actionable plan.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post asks ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" which directly inquires about the lethality of a substance (duloxetine, an antidepressant). 
   - It includes a statement about possession and preparation: ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later."" This suggests the author may be considering using the pills for self-harm, but there is no explicit expression of emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness, despair) or a stated desire to die.
   - No specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned; ""later"" is vague.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The question ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is general and not personalized as a statement of intent (e.g., it uses ""you"" rather than ""I"").
   - There is no clear, personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication of whether they are unwanted or not. The focus is on the lethality of the pills and possession of them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (overdosing on duloxetine pills) is strongly implied by the context of asking about lethality and saving pills.
   - Preparation is indicated by ""saving for later,"" suggesting the pills are being hoarded for potential use.
   - However, for 'Behavior' classification, explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire must accompany the plan/method/preparation. Here, the desire is not stated; it is only implied.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future-oriented intention (""saving for later"") but no specific, initiated action (e.g., no description of taking pills or being interrupted). 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. While the content (lethality question and pill possession) is concerning and may indicate risk, it does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit personal desire) or 'Behavior' (which requires both explicit desire and plan/method).
   - Due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, the ""if in doubt"" rule for 'Indicator' applies. The post falls under 'Indicator' as it discusses death abstractly (via a question about drug lethality) and shows preparatory behavior without explicit suicidal intent.

I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I feel so empty,"" ""out of place,"" ""It's hell""), a sense of being uncared for (""If anyone or anything truly cared about my life I know it isn't me""), and a desire to ""end"" (""I just want to end but haven't yet""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm using explicit terms. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are described. The phrase ""I just want to end"" implies a wish to cease suffering or life, but it is not explicit. Emotional indicators include despair, anhedonia, and feeling disconnected. The temporal context is current, with no imminent timeframe or past actions indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""I just want to end"" suggests a possible desire to not be alive but is ambiguous—it could refer to ending emotional pain rather than life. The writer does not explicitly state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or negate a desire to die, but the lack of clarity in expression creates ambiguity. Since suicide/death is not explicitly mentioned and the desire is not clearly articulated, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The absence of these elements means this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a general desire (""I just want to end"") but explicitly states no action has been taken (""haven't yet""). There is no description of past or recent initiated actions, so this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and a vague desire to ""end,"" but without explicit personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). Due to ambiguity in interpreting ""end"" and the lack of explicit suicidal intent per the guidelines, this falls under 'Indicator' (as per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator""). There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior', and no described actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.

But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions death/suicide: ""I could be dead by the end of the day,"" ""I cant off myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""distracts from life""), fatigue framing life as burdensome.
   - Specific method/plan: Explicitly references buying gas to ""off myself"" as a method.
   - Preparations: None described; states inability to act due to fatigue (""never leave the house"").
   - Imminence: Hypothetical (""could be dead today"") but conditional on overcoming fatigue.
   - Desire: Expresses genuine wish to die (""off myself"") but blames inaction on fatigue.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""off myself"" is a direct suicide reference; ""could be dead by the end of the day"" implies active desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific method: Gas is mentioned as a means (""buy the gas"").
   - Preparation: None—fatigue prevents acquiring means (""never leave the house"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Future intention (""could be dead today"") but no past/current action initiated. Fatigue blocks execution.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire for suicide + specific method (gas) = **Behavior**.
   - Despite barriers (fatigue), the plan/method is stated. No action taken, so not Attempt. Unambiguous plan/method rules out Ideation.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""do it"" and ""do it already"" in the context of suicide, as indicated by ""I post about suicide constantly."" This shows a personal desire to act on suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include self-criticism (""stop being a pussy,"" ""suck it up"") and a sense of urgency (""already""), implying frustration and a push toward action. No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post references past expressions (""post about suicide constantly"") but no concrete past actions like an attempt. Imminence is suggested with ""already"" but not specified (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire to die is clear and not portrayed as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide through ""post about suicide constantly,"" and ""do it"" is a direct implication of committing suicide. The phrases ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" express a clear, personal desire to die. Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the author expresses frustration about not acting on them, so this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The focus is on the desire to act (""do it"") without details on how, when, or where. Since there is no plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current/future intention to act (""should just suck it up and do it already"") but no past or recent initiated lethal action. References to ""post about suicide constantly"" are about expressions, not concrete actions like an attempt (e.g., no mention of taking pills or self-harm). Therefore, there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and thoughts, falling under 'Ideation' due to the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation. It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal intent is personal and desired, not abstract or unwanted. 'Behavior' is not applicable as no plan/method is present, and 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past or recent action is described.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions past self-harm (""I started to cut my rights leg"") and a past suicide plan (""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"") that was not acted upon. It details a current, specific suicide plan: ""I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe,"" with preparations stated: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" Emotional indicators include feeling overwhelmed, unmotivated, and ""done with everything,"" but the writer claims not to be sad or depressed, instead expressing a sense of resignation and a ""weird feeling"" of happiness. There is no mention of the suicidal thoughts being unwanted; the tone is matter-of-fact and resolved.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""hang myself,"" expressing a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""end it""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the writer is actively planning.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: hanging and cutting off a finger with an axe. Preparations are confirmed: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" This indicates concrete planning and acquisition of means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") but explicitly states it was not acted upon (""But I didn't""). The self-cutting is described as a coping mechanism, not a suicide attempt. The current plan (""I plan to hang myself"") is future-oriented, with no indication of initiation. No past or recent potentially lethal action (e.g., an actual suicide attempt) is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and detailed plan/method/preparations rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear personal suicidal intent) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan or method). The absence of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., a described attempt) rules out 'Attempt'. The presence of a current plan, specific method, and preparations aligns with 'Behavior'.

We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses existential themes about the pointlessness of life and death, with phrases like ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""I wish I was never born."" However, the writer explicitly states, ""I don't really want to die,"" indicating a lack of current desire for death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""there still is no point for us being here"") and despair, but no mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The tone is philosophical and distressed, focusing on general dissatisfaction rather than personal suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. While it references death and not wanting to be born, the writer clearly negates a desire to die with ""don't really want to die."" Suicidal thoughts, if implied, are presented as unwanted or conflicted, leaning toward 'Indicator' due to the emphasis on distress about existence rather than a genuine wish to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content is entirely focused on thoughts and feelings, with no actionable elements for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and existential musings, not past events or actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal behavior, such as an attempt or interrupted action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide, as the writer explicitly states they do not want to die. This aligns with 'Indicator,' which covers abstract discussions of death and unwanted thoughts without suicidal intent. There is no evidence of ideation (desire to die), behavior (plan/method), or attempt (past action). Ambiguity about suicidal desire is resolved by the writer's direct negation, supporting 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation... choose Indicator.""

   - There are **no mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress and fear of social rejection, but **no expressions of hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or being a burden** in a suicidal context. 
   - The author describes a past action (buying the item) and anxiety about future social interactions, but **no plans, preparations, or references to suicidal actions** (past or present). 
   - The plea (""please don't leave a comment about how disgusting I am"") and request for advice (""What do I do"") indicate distress but **no desire to die**.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents appear. 
   - **No expressions of a desire to die or not be alive** (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). The focus is on shame and social survival, not ending life. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts/desires are **absent entirely**, this aligns with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No mention** of suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses **past events** (buying the item, starting NoFap) and **future social fears** (new school). 
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows **distress without suicidal desire, plans, or actions**. The core issue is shame/social anxiety, falling under general distress. 
   - **No evidence** pushes this to 'Ideation' (desire to die), 'Behavior' (plan/method), or 'Attempt' (past action). Ambiguity rules default to 'Indicator'.

494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses anger and frustration towards family for not allowing suicide (""they dont let you kill yourself""), feelings of suffering (""why do you want me to suffer""), and hopelessness (""sick of it""). It references suicide indirectly but lacks specific details about methods, plans, preparations, or timelines. No past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""kill yourself"" is mentioned, but it is used in a general or rhetorical context (""they dont let you kill yourself""), not as a direct, personal statement like ""I want to kill myself."" The author implies a desire through the complaint about suffering, but it is not an explicit expression of personal suicidal intent. The focus is on the family's role in preventing suicide, not on the author's current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation (e.g., note, means), or location is mentioned. The content is hypothetical and lacks concrete details about carrying out suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses a general situation without reference to past, current, or future actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows distress and abstract discussion of suicide but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent). The use of ""you"" in ""kill yourself"" is ambiguous and not explicitly self-referential in a way that confirms personal suicidal desire. Given the ambiguity and the rule to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', this fits 'Indicator'. There is no evidence of a plan or preparation for 'Behavior', and no described action for 'Attempt'.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense loneliness (""am i lonely""), feelings of being uncared for (""nobody fucking cares""), and self-deprecation (""Im such a spoiled piece of shit""). There are indirect references to suicide, such as ""say im going to do it"" (where ""do it"" implies suicide in context) and a direct plea for death: ""pls fucking end me before the day."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""nobody cares ever"") and a stated desire for death. However, there is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions. The phrase ""before the day"" suggests some urgency but lacks concrete imminence (e.g., no specific time like ""tonight""). The writer's desire to die appears genuine, not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly implies suicidal intent through ""say im going to do it"" (with ""do it"" contextually meaning suicide) and directly expresses a desire to die with ""pls fucking end me."" The writer does not negate or express distress about these thoughts being unwanted; instead, they convey frustration that concern only arises when suicide is mentioned, reinforcing a personal wish for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The plea ""end me"" is passive and relies on external action, with no indication of the writer's own plan or means. Thus, there is no evidence of planning or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a desire for death but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no reference to initiated attempts, interruptions, or failures). The focus is on feelings and intentions, not concrete behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The writer expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""end me""), aligning with 'Ideation.' However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior.' No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. While there is distress, the explicit suicidal desire prevents classification as 'Indicator.' The ambiguity in ""do it"" and the plea for death still constitute explicit ideation without a plan.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses a wish to be a victim of a stabbing (""I hope it'll be me next"") to avoid the shame associated with suicide. It mentions suicide indirectly in the context of rejecting it as an option due to familial shame. There is a clear desire to die (e.g., ""Wouldn't have to bring shame""), but this desire is for death via an external event (stabbing), not self-inflicted harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and shame. No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like acquiring means). No references to past actions or attempts. The imminence is vague (""recently,"" ""next""), with no specific timeframe for action. The writer's stated desire is for death but explicitly not through suicide, as they view suicide negatively.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is mentioned (""suicide""), but only to contrast it with the preferred external cause of death (stabbing). The writer expresses a clear desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next""), but this desire is not suicidal—it is a wish for passive death (i.e., being killed by someone else) rather than active self-harm. Suicidal thoughts are referenced but explicitly rejected as unwanted due to shame, indicating distress about the concept of suicide rather than a personal desire to act on it. This leans toward 'Indicator' because the primary sentiment is a death wish without suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to stabbing is about hoping for an external event, not a self-initiated plan. There is no indication of the writer considering or preparing for self-harm (e.g., no tools, notes, or locations for suicide). Without any plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future-oriented hope (""I hope it'll be me next"") with no reference to past or recent actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal act (e.g., no attempt, interruption, or failure). The content is entirely wishful thinking about an external event, not self-directed behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a desire to die but explicitly rejects suicide as a means, focusing instead on a passive death wish (being stabbed). This aligns with 'Indicator' because:
     - It discusses suicide abstractly (as a shameful act to avoid) but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author.
     - The writer states they do not want to act on suicidal thoughts, emphasizing distress about suicide (due to shame) rather than a genuine wish to die by their own hand.
     - While there is a general desire not to be alive, the absence of explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or action places this in 'Indicator'. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (due to the preference for external death) also defaults to 'Indicator' per the rules.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire to commit suicide; the death wish is passive and non-self-inflicted. No elements of 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action) are present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself"" twice, expressing a direct desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""0 friends,"" ""no skills no job no money""), feeling like a burden (""something blocking me... my family""), and anhedonia (lack of social life).  
   - Specific methods/preparations are implied: ""disappear... go to another country have another identity... kill myself with peace... no one knowing."" This suggests planning to isolate and commit suicide covertly.  
   - No past actions are described (e.g., no mention of prior attempts). The focus is on future intent.  
   - The writer explicitly desires death (""i want to put an end to it all"") and does not frame suicidal thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""killmyself,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""put an end to it all"" confirm explicit personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: The writer details preparations (""disappear,"" ""go to another country,"" ""have another identity"") to facilitate suicide covertly. This constitutes planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes future intentions (""how can i just disappear?"") and hypothetical scenarios (""maybe was just an accident""). No past or recent initiated lethal actions are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""Ideation"" threshold) is met.  
   - The mention of concrete steps to isolate and conceal suicide (""disappear,"" ""another country/identity"") indicates **planning/preparation**, moving it to **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"") rules out ""Attempt.""  
   - The suicidal desire is personal and current, ruling out ""Indicator.""

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag..."" 
    - It details a specific method (suffocation with tools) and location (under blankets). 
    - The writer expresses intense desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO [DIE] AS WELL"") and frustration over survival. 
    - Future intent is stated (""I'm gonna try again tonight"") with a backup plan (""Plan B""), confirming ongoing suicidal intent. 
    - Emotional indicators include despair (""THIS NEEDS TO END!"") and hopelessness. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""almost died,"" ""wanted to [die]."" Genuine desire to die is repeatedly emphasized. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **Method**: Explicitly described for both past (""suffocation using a mask and plastic bag"") and future (""try again tonight,"" ""Plan B"") actions. 
    - **Preparation**: Implied by recounting the setup (tools/location) and intent to reattempt. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes a **concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** taken ""last night"" (past) that was interrupted (""I BREATHE""). 
    - Future plans are declared, but the **dominant focus is on the recent initiated action**. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The core of the post is the description of a **past suicide attempt** (initiated suffocation that nearly succeeded). 
    - This meets the 'Attempt' definition: a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that failed due to interruption (involuntary breathing). 
    - Though future plans ('Behavior') are mentioned, the detailed account of the recent attempt takes precedence. 
    - Rules state: If a past attempt is described, label 'Attempt'.

499,"Just don't want to get out of bed. I've got a lot to be happy about right now, I'm playing rugby with a very inclusive team, I'm starting my second year at uni in 3 weeks, I have an amazing bf and an awesome best friend and I'm 4 months on hrt . I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions fatigue (""soooo tierd,"" ""want to sleep 24/7""), emptiness (""feel empty""), and worry about depressive episodes ruining friendships. 
    - Notes positive aspects of life (rugby, university, supportive relationships, HRT progress), indicating ambivalence but no loss of hope.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Expresses distress (depression symptoms, relational fears) but **lacks personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**. 
    - Ambivalence exists (acknowledging positive life aspects), but core content aligns with general depressive distress without suicidal intent.
