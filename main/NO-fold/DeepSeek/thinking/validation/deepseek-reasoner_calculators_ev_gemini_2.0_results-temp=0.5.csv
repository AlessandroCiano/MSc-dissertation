0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: Mentions ""ending my life again"" (explicit suicidal thought), ""hate being myself"" (emotional despair), and specific method/location: ""go to a bridge and jump off."" Also includes hopelessness (""Never will find love""), self-hatred (""hate being gay""), and distress from work. The phrase ""again"" suggests recurring thoughts, but no description of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Imminence is implied with ""want to,"" but not specified (e.g., ""tonight""). Desire for suicide is personal and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, explicitly mentions ""ending my life"" and ""jump off,"" indicating direct suicidal intent. Expresses clear desire to die with ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off."" No statement that thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method and location mentioned: ""go to a bridge and jump off."" This constitutes a plan and method, even if not highly detailed. Coupled with strong intent (""I want to""), this indicates preparation for action. No other preparations (e.g., note-writing) are noted, but the method is explicit.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on current/future intentions: ""thinking about ending my life again"" (suggesting recurring ideation) and ""I want to go"" (current desire). ""Again"" refers to past thoughts, not a described past action. No mention of a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to jump"" or ""I overdosed""), so no basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (e.g., ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off""), ruling out 'Indicator'. A specific plan/method (bridge/jumping) is present, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' (which lacks such details). No past initiated action described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The combination of desire, plan, and method aligns with 'Behavior', especially given the directness of ""I want to.""

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post states ""I'm inconsolable,"" indicating deep emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair. The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" explicitly mentions death and implies imminence (""soon""), suggesting a personal expectation or desire for death in the context of despair. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions. The focus is on the author's current state and future-oriented statement about dying.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I'm going to die soon"" in a context of inconsolable despair expresses a clear personal desire for life to end or an expectation of imminent death. This is similar to phrases like ""life isn't worth it"" or ""I wish I could disappear,"" which imply suicidal ideation. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") indicating unwanted thoughts, so it leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" is vague and does not indicate a plan, intended action, or how death might occur. Despite the high imminence (""soon""), the lack of any reference to method or action means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future-oriented statement (""going to die soon"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts). It focuses on current feelings and future intent, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""I'm going to die soon"" in despair constitutes an explicit personal desire for death or life to end, fitting 'Ideation' (e.g., similar to ""I want to die"" or ""life isn't worth it""). There is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The thoughts are not stated as unwanted, so 'Indicator' is not appropriate. No past action is described, so 'Attempt' is excluded. The ambiguity in ""I'm going to die soon"" is resolved by the context of despair, confirming suicidal ideation without actionable elements.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness, specifically ""I hate living"" and questioning the purpose of existence (""why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night""). There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No references to plans, preparations, or past actions are present. The language expresses a strong dissatisfaction with life but does not indicate imminence (e.g., no timeframes like ""tonight""). The writer's stated desire centers on hating life, which implies a wish for life to end, but there is no explicit statement about wanting to die or acting on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. However, ""I hate living"" is a strong expression that implies a desire for life to end, as per the guidelines (phrases like this generally indicate ideation unless negated). There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, the content suggests a personal desire to not be alive, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The post focuses on feelings and existential thoughts without any reference to planning or intended action. Even with the expression of hating life, there is no indication of how the writer might act on these feelings, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key phrase ""I hate living"" is a profound expression of wanting life to end, which fits the 'Ideation' definition (explicit personal desire to not be alive without a plan or method). There is no evidence of unwanted thoughts (which would indicate 'Indicator'), no plan or preparation (which would indicate 'Behavior'), and no past action (which would indicate 'Attempt'). The lack of negation or ambiguity in the desire confirms 'Ideation'.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicitly states ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent. 
   - Requests help to acquire a specific lethal substance (barbiturates/Nembutal), which is a method/means. 
   - No emotional indicators beyond the plea, but the request itself demonstrates preparation/intent. 
   - No reference to past actions; focuses on current/future intent. 
   - High imminence is implied by the urgent plea (""Help me,"" ""Please somebody help me"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent. 
   - The language shows a clear, personal desire to die (""Help me kill myself""). 
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Yes: Specifically requests ""trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,"" naming a method (lethal overdose). 
   - Actively seeking means (""help me find"") constitutes preparation. 
   - Coupled with explicit intent and urgency, this confirms planning/action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes current/future intention (plea for immediate help to obtain means). 
   - No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out **Indicator**. 
   - Specific method (barbiturates) and active preparation (seeking means) elevate it beyond **Ideation**. 
   - No described past/initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I took pills"") rules out **Attempt**. 
   - Matches **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific method/preparation.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post begins with ""Is there a painless way to die,"" indicating a focus on methods of dying. It expresses emotional distress like hopelessness (""I'm struggling,"" ""feel unmotivated,"" ""feel worthless""), despair (""I'm tired""), and self-perceived burden (""I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish""). The phrase ""I want to sleep forever"" is a euphemism for death. There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is present but coupled with uncertainty about methods (""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but phrases like ""I want to sleep forever"" and the opening question about a ""painless way to die"" convey a clear personal desire for life to end. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, explicit desire is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The post inquires about methods (""painless way to die,"" ""die with certainty and without pain"") but does not specify any plan, method, tools, location, or preparations. The context is one of uncertainty and questioning, not intention or readiness to act. No imminence is suggested, and the desire is not paired with actionable steps. Therefore, no 'Behavior' elements are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to sleep forever"") places this beyond 'Indicator', which requires ambiguous or unwanted suicidal thoughts. The absence of a specific plan, method, preparation, or imminence rules out 'Behavior'. With no past actions described, 'Attempt' is inapplicable. The core content is an expression of suicidal thoughts with a desire to die but no actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'. The method inquiry reflects ideation rather than planning, as it is vague and lacks intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness (""whats the point of living,"" ""life is all pointless,"" ""huge waste of time"") and explicitly mentions suicidal desire (""i still want to die,"" ""i should do it anyways,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves""). 
   - It references past suicidal thoughts (""made me want to kill myself,"" ""constantly thinking about how nothing matters"") but emphasizes *current* ongoing desire (""still want to die""). 
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The focus is on existential despair and persistent ideation without actionable steps. 
   - The author does not negate or express distress about *unwanted* thoughts; instead, they rationalize suicide (""none of this matters"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, explicit phrases include ""want to kill myself,"" ""kill ourselves,"" and ""i still want to die."" 
   - **Yes**, profound expressions like ""life is all pointless"" and ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves"" convey a genuine personal desire for death. 
   - **No** explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""tonight I will...""), or preparation (e.g., ""bought a rope"") is mentioned. The phrase ""do it"" refers vaguely to suicide but lacks concrete details. 
   - Despite high despair, no imminent action or method is implied. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes past and *current* suicidal thoughts but **no past or recent self-initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose""). Mentions ""thinking about"" suicide, not acting on it. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation** fits best: Explicit personal desire to die (""want to die,"" ""kill myself"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation. Strong hopelessness reinforces ideation. 
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts. 
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan, method, or preparation. 
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past initiated lethal actions.

6,"I want to be gone tonight. I'm in so much mental pain, I want this pain to turn into physical. I want it to be over tonight, I don't wanna survive it. Please, I don't want it to continue, I can't handle it, I want it to stop. I hate everything, I need peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it,"" which indicate a strong desire for death or cessation of life. Emotional indicators include ""I'm in so much mental pain,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""I hate everything,"" and ""I need peace,"" showing despair and hopelessness. There is a vague reference to action with ""I want this pain to turn into physical,"" which could imply an intention to engage in self-harm or a suicidal method, but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The timeframe is highly imminent (""tonight""), and the author's desire to die is personal and not negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight"" and ""I don't wanna survive it."" These are direct expressions of a wish for life to end, not abstract discussions. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are presented as genuine desires.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" is a vague reference to intended action, implying a potential method for suicide or self-harm. Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""tonight""), this vague reference, in context, suggests an intended action (e.g., inflicting physical harm to end mental pain). However, no specific method, tools, or preparations are detailed. The combination of strong intent, high imminence, and this action-oriented statement leans this toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""tonight"") with no mention of past actions. There is no description of a past initiated suicidal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit suicidal intent or explicitly unwanted thoughts). The presence of an intended action (""I want this pain to turn into physical""), though vague, coupled with high imminence and strong intent, moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks any plan/method/action). 'Behavior' is appropriate here due to the implied intended action in the context of imminent risk. 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action is described.

I'm so sick n I just wanna die. It's the best for me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong emotional distress, including feelings of worthlessness, faking happiness, purposelessness, and pain. It explicitly states ""I just wanna die"" and ""It's the best for me,"" indicating a personal desire for death. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). The language focuses on current emotional suffering and a wish to die, with no indication of unwanted suicidal thoughts or abstract discussion.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions a desire to die with phrases like ""I just wanna die,"" which is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") to suggest these thoughts are unwanted. This rules out 'Indicator' and strongly supports 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances), plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The statement ""I just wanna die"" expresses desire but lacks any reference to how, when, or where it might happen. Without even a vague plan or imminent action, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, not past events. There is no mention of initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is an explicit, personal desire to die (""I just wanna die""), placing it in 'Ideation'. While the emotional distress is severe, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The lack of unwanted thoughts or ambiguity about suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator', and no past/current action is described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Phrases like ""I just wanna die"" are definitive for 'Ideation' when not coupled with actionable elements.

I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself,"" indicating intrusive suicidal thoughts. However, the author explicitly states, ""I don't actually want to,"" negating personal desire to die. Additional elements include self-loathing (""ugly,"" ""stupid,"" ""not good enough""), emotional exhaustion (""tiring""), loneliness, and distress about these unwanted thoughts. No plan, method, preparation, or past suicidal actions are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""kill myself"": **Yes**.  
   - Clear desire to die? **No**—explicitly rejected with ""I don't actually want to.""  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as **unwanted and distressing** (e.g., ""my brain keeps telling me,"" ""tiring to try to love yourself"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations referenced.  
   - No implied action beyond intrusive thoughts.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current intrusive thoughts**, not past actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, preparations, or initiated self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core issue is **distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts** (""my brain tells me... but I don’t want to""), aligning with **Indicator**.  
   - Phrases like ""I hate living"" (absent here) would lean toward Ideation, but the explicit negation of desire to die overrides this.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out Behavior/Attempt.  
   - Historical attempts? None described.

    - Plan/method: Specific methods proposed (knife confrontation with police, obtaining opioids) and intent to act immediately (""now, right now"").
    - Imminence: Strong immediacy (""now, right now,"" ""in this instant"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Yes. Two specific methods are mentioned: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids."" The writer explicitly considers actionable means despite uncertainty (""I dont know, i wouldnt know""). High imminence (""now"") strengthens this.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Focuses on *current/future* intent (""want to die now""). No description of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried X yesterday""). Mentions a 5–6 year struggle but no past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses explicit desire to die (Ideation threshold met) **and** specific methods/actionable plans (knife, opioids) with high imminence. This fulfills 'Behavior' criteria.

   - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeline, or past action described. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - ""Get it over with"" implies a desire to end suffering/life, especially in context of deterioration and despair. ""Go through with it"" confirms suicidal intent (desire to act). 
   - **Yes**, there is a clear personal desire to end suffering/life. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"") is present. Fear of pain indicates ambivalence but **not** rejection of the desire itself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Explicitly states ""i plan to kill myself at 21"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""not fixable, no hope""), despair (""this is hell""), anhedonia, self-loathing, and profound distress.
   - Plan/method: Specifies a future action (""plan to kill myself at 21"") and implies a method (""kill myself"").
   - Imminence: Action is planned for age 21 (3 years from current age of 18).
   - Desire: Explicitly states a plan to act ""whether I want to or not,"" indicating intent despite ambivalence. Phrases like ""there is no hope"" reinforce desire for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Yes (desire implied by hopelessness and explicit plan).
   - No explicit negation of desire (ambivalence ""whether I want to or not"" still confirms intent to act).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Method: Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" (vague but contextually clear as suicidal action).
   - Plan: Specific timeframe (""at 21"").
   - No preparation mentioned, but stated intention to act qualifies as intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes future intention (""plan to kill myself at 21"").
   - No past actions described; focuses on future intent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + stated plan/method → **Behavior**. 
   - ""Plan to kill myself"" confirms suicidal intent with intended action (even if future-dated). 
   - No past initiated lethal action → Rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Strong intent overrides ambivalence (""whether I want to or not"").

I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case. Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?I have prolly stopped making sense at this point. But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit expressions like ""I want to die"" and ""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon,"" indicating suicidal thoughts but with a qualifier. Emotional indicators are strong, including hopelessness (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""), despair (""crying myself to sleep every night""), self-loathing (""I don't like anything about myself""), and isolation. There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The timeframe for potential action is deferred (""given myself 5 more years""), so imminence is low. The writer expresses a desire to die but explicitly states no immediate intent to act. There are no references to past suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""kill myself,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. The qualifier ""not any time soon"" delays action but does not negate the underlying desire or indicate that the thoughts are unwanted; it merely postpones potential action. This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' because the desire is personally expressed and not framed as distressing but unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or plan is mentioned. The reference to suicide is general and lacks details on how it might be carried out. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The low imminence (""5 more years"") and absence of any action-oriented language mean this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current feelings and future thoughts but no past or recent initiated actions. There is no mention of a prior suicide attempt or self-harm, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") places this in 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' (which would require ambiguous desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). The lack of any plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent rules out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Despite the deferral of action (""5 more years""), the core expression of suicidal thoughts without behavioral elements fits 'Ideation'.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to.

I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Explicitly states ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I've considered hanging.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""stuck in this rat race,"" ""feel so empty,"" ""things are crushing""), worthlessness (""never good enough""), and despair (""I hate living"" implied through context).  
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specifically references ""hanging"" as a method but **explicitly negates action** (""I can't seem to go through with it""). No preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - Temporal context/action: No past or recent initiated suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried""). Focus is on *thoughts* and *inability to act*.  
   - Desire: Expresses suicidal ideation (""only way out is suicide"") but repeatedly emphasizes **lack of intent/ability** (""don't have the guts,"" ""can't seem to go through with it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, explicit phrases: ""suicide,"" ""considered hanging.""  
   - **Yes**, desire to die/escape (""only way out is suicide"").  
   - **Crucially, the desire is negated/unwanted**: ""I don't have the guts"" and ""can't seem to go through with it"" indicate distress about *inability* to act, not a genuine intent to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method mentioned (""hanging"") but **immediately negated** (""can't seem to go through with it"").  
   - **No plan** (e.g., timing, location), **no preparation**, and **no imminence** (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past/current actions described (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself""). Only references *consideration* of a method, not initiation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (""only way out is suicide"") and method reference (""hanging"") suggest Ideation/Behavior. However, **repeated negation of intent/action** (""don't have the guts"") and absence of plan/preparation/imminence align with **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Indicator**: Strong suicidal desire is expressed, so not Indicator.  
   - **Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Key nuance**: While ""considered hanging"" implies method, the *explicit unwillingness to act* (""can't go through with it"") and lack of plan/preparation place this in **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal notes,"" indicating direct references to suicide and self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"") and a clear decision to act (""i've decided on it"").
   - Specific plans or methods are implied but not detailed (""just a matter of when and how""), while preparations are explicitly stated (""i already got my suicidal notes ready"").
   - No references to past actions; the focus is on current/future intentions.
   - Imminence is indicated with urgency (""not for another year""), suggesting action within a year but not immediate.
   - The writer expresses a genuine, unnegated desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself"" and conveys a clear, personal desire to die (""i'm going to kill myself and i've decided on it"").
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While the method is vague (""how""), preparations are explicitly mentioned (""suicidal notes ready"").
   - The presence of preparations (suicide notes) qualifies as an intended action element, especially combined with the explicit desire and decision.
   - This indicates 'Behavior' due to the concrete step taken toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions, not past actions. There is no mention of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").
   - Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire, moving it beyond 'Indicator'.
   - Preparations (suicide notes) are present, so it is not just 'Ideation' (which lacks plans/methods/actions).
   - No past initiated action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The combination of desire, decision, and preparation fits 'Behavior', even if the method is vague and imminence is not immediate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing, body image issues, and a desire to escape one's current self (e.g., ""i hate everything about myself,"" ""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i still look disgusting""), despair, and profound dissatisfaction with life, but these are tied to self-image rather than a wish for life to end. 
   - No references to suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions. 
   - No imminence of harmful intentions; the focus is on frustration with appearance. 
   - The writer's stated desire is to ""be someone else,"" not to die or cease existing, indicating distress without suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end; phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent. The closest expression (""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else"") implies a desire for transformation, not death. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no context for unwanted thoughts. 
   - **Result**: No explicit suicidal intent, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of any suicide-related method, tool, substance, location, or preparation. 
   - Actions described (e.g., changing hair, makeup, clothes, eating habits) are efforts to improve appearance, not preparations for self-harm. 
   - With no suicidal desire established, this step does not support 'Behavior'. 
   - **Result**: No evidence of plan, method, or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions related to self-image (e.g., ""i've dyed and cut my hair"") but no past or recent suicidal actions. 
   - No initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no references to self-harm or suicide attempts). 
   - **Result**: No evidence for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows significant distress, hopelessness, and self-hatred but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt. 
   - Strong negative emotions like ""I hate everything about myself"" are not equivalent to ""I hate living"" and do not imply a wish to die; they are tied to identity/body issues. 
   - Without suicidal ideation, this fits 'Indicator', which covers general distress or dissatisfaction with life when suicidal intent is absent. 
   - There is no ambiguity about suicidal desire after careful analysis—the core issue is a desire to change identity, not end life. 
   - Rules: The focus is solely on the author; no other categories apply.

**Conclusion**: The post is classified as 'Indicator' because it expresses distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past action.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses people who post about intending to kill themselves or being in the process, but it is framed as a rhetorical question and the author's opinion about others' motivations. 
   - There are no personal mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods by the author. 
   - Emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) are absent; instead, the author expresses a belief that such posters are seeking help and not genuinely wanting self-harm. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions by the author are described. 
   - No imminence of intent is present, as the focus is on others' behavior. 
   - The author does not express any personal desire to die or for life to end; the content is analytical and abstract.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post references ""kill themselves"" and suicide-related posting, but this is attributed to others, not the author. 
   - There is no clear personal desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end expressed by the author. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned personally by the author, the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply. 
   - No personal suicidal intent is present, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the author. 
   - The discussion is about others' posts, not the author's actions or intentions. 
   - With no personal desire or intent established, this step does not support 'Behavior' for the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past, current, or future personal actions by the author. 
   - It does not reference any self-initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post involves abstract discussion of suicide (others' posts) without any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions from the author. 
   - The author's opinion (""looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves"") reinforces a focus on general distress in others, not personal risk. 
   - This aligns with 'Indicator', defined as expressing general or abstract distress about suicide without a current, personal desire to die or suicidal intent. 
   - There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (personal plan or preparation), or 'Attempt' (personal past action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions ""no point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""Im so tired of being alive,"" and ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself."" These express hopelessness, feeling like a burden, and explicit suicidal desire.
    - References past actions: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed"" explicitly describes self-initiated suicide attempts.
    - No specific current plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timelines for future action).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes. ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent. ""No point in being alive"" and ""tired of being alive"" reinforce a desire for life to end.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - No current method, plan, or preparation described. The focus is on past actions (""tried"") rather than imminent future behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes past suicide attempts: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" This confirms self-initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author, regardless of timeframe.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit suicidal desire and past actions take precedence. The author clearly describes historical suicide attempts (""tried""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' definition. Current distress/ideation is present but does not override the confirmed past attempts.

19,"I honestly couldn't care less if I am some beta male pussy for killing myself. ""Natural selection only the strong live on blah blah."" I don't really care, I don't want to be alive.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as seen in phrases like ""I don't want to be alive"" and dismissiveness toward societal judgments (e.g., ""I don't really care"" about being called names for suicide).
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past actions or attempts are made; the focus is on current feelings.
   - No indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is present; the statements are general.
   - The writer expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive (""I don't want to be alive""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase related to suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or for life to end, as evidenced by ""I don't want to be alive."" This is a personal and explicit expression of suicidal intent.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Therefore, this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Although there is an explicit desire to die, the context lacks any reference to intended action, plan, or method (even vague ones). Phrases like ""killing myself"" are general and not coupled with high imminence or actionable intent. Thus, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions, not past events. There is no description of a past initiated action (e.g., no mention of ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I don't want to be alive"") and explicitly references suicide (""killing myself""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. There is no ambiguity about the desire being unwanted; it is directly stated and personal.
   - No plan, method, preparation, or intended action is mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - General distress is present, but the explicit suicidal intent places this in 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'. Phrases like ""I don't want to be alive"" are strong indicators of ideation when not negated.
   - Given the absence of behavioral elements and the focus on thoughts/desire, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""desire to kill myself"" and ""killing myself"".  
   - Expressions of hopelessness (""why try?"", ""what's the point?""), perceived futility of efforts, and comparison of current suffering to past suicide attempts.  
   - Specific reference to method: ""overdose"" and metaphorical reference to ""getting hit by an incoming train"".  
   - Description of **past actions**: ""attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"".  
   - No explicit negation of suicidal desire; instead, persistent intent (""desire to kill myself has not"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""desire to kill myself"", ""killing myself"". Genuine wish to die expressed (""I just want out... I'd honestly choose that"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method explicitly stated: ""overdose"" (past attempts). Metaphorical train reference implies considering methods, but primary focus is on **past actions**.  
   - **No current plan/preparation** described; emphasis is on historical attempts and current despair.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions**: overdoses (twice in two weeks, three times in six months). Author explicitly labels these as attempts.  
   - Links past attempts to current state (""easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) and past methods are present, but **'Attempt' takes precedence** because the author describes specific, self-initiated past actions (overdoses) that were potentially lethal.  
   - Timeframe (past two weeks/six months) doesn’t disqualify; the author connects these attempts to their current feelings.  
   - No current plan/intended action overrides the historical 'Attempt' classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses extreme distress, panic attacks, and fear about potential diabetes and concerns regarding DIY HRT. Phrases like ""I'm fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" and ""I'm so fucking scared"" indicate high emotional distress.  
   - There are references to feeling overwhelmed (""it's just too much"") and helplessness (""what the fuck do I do?"").  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions.  
   - The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is metaphorical, expressing dependency on HRT, not a literal desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalents.  
   - **No expressions** of a desire to not be alive (e.g., ""hate living,"" ""life isn’t worth it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No implied or explicit references to plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No descriptions** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress (panic, fear, overwhelm) but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Metaphorical language (""can't live without estrogen"") does not equate to suicidal intent.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress about health, identity, and family dynamics without suicidal ideation or behavior.

   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""There is NO hope left""), despair from failed treatments (medications, biofeedback, therapy, EMDR, TMS), financial hardship (""I live on $786 a month""), and a direct statement of intent: ""Now it's time to end it."" There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). References to past actions (""I tried. And I tried again..."") appear in the context of seeking treatment (e.g., medications, therapies), not explicit suicide attempts. The phrase ""end it"" is a euphemism for suicide but lacks detail on method or plan. Imminence is indicated with ""Now.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""Now it's time to end it"" explicitly expresses a personal desire for life to end in a context of despair, implying suicidal intent. There is no negation (e.g., no statement that these thoughts are unwanted), so this aligns with ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation is mentioned. ""End it"" is vague and does not imply a concrete action, method, or means, even with the high imminence (""Now""). Without any reference to how the act would be carried out, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past efforts focused on treatments (""I tried..."" refers to attempting different therapies, not suicide attempts), as evidenced by the preceding list. No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I took pills"") are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The key statement (""Now it's time to end it"") is future-oriented intent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""end it"") and hopelessness indicate 'Ideation', as there is a current personal expression of suicidal intent. However, the absence of any plan, method, preparation, or detailed intended action means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. The past ""tried"" references are about treatments, not suicide attempts, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the clear, unnegated desire to die. Vague phrases like ""end it"" with imminence but no method lean toward 'Ideation' when intent is high but ambiguity about plan/method persists.

23,"Society doesn't like me. People bully me in everywhere. Even on reddit I don't feel comfortable. Definetly something is wrong with me. But I don't know what. Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday. Everyday I am trying to survive. I am studying learning watching videos daydream a lot. But nothing fills the hole in my heart. I feel lonely I feel like I am only watching other living human beings. I feel like I am on the moon. I am very unconnocted with this world. In the pas I tried to hide this with saying ""I am misanthrope"" but no I wish I could have friends who supports me. I feel like a creature.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""thinking about suicide everyday"" explicitly, indicating personal suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing fills the hole in my heart""), despair (""I feel lonely,"" ""I feel like I am on the moon""), isolation (""I am very unconnocted [disconnected] with this world""), and a sense of being a burden or flawed (""something is wrong with me,"" ""I feel like a creature""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or timelines for action. The phrase ""everyday I am trying to survive"" suggests an ongoing struggle but no imminent intent. A past event is referenced (""In the pas I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'""), but this describes concealing feelings, not a suicidal action. The writer's desire is expressed through suicidal thoughts, but it is not explicitly negated as unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""thinking about suicide everyday""). It expresses a personal desire related to death through this phrase, which implies suicidal ideation. There is no explicit negation of this desire (e.g., no ""I don't want these thoughts""), though ""trying to survive"" indicates a conflict. Strong emotional expressions like ""nothing fills the hole in my heart"" and ""I feel like a creature"" support a genuine personal desire for escape, aligning with ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or intended action is mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, locations, or steps like ""writing a note""). The reference to suicide is vague and thought-based, with no indication of imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). Therefore, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts (""everyday I am thinking about suicide"") and a past behavior of hiding feelings (""tried to hide this""), but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I attempted"" or ""I tried to kill myself""). The absence of any described suicide attempt rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""thinking about suicide"" indicates a personal desire to die, falling under 'Ideation'. There is no plan/method/preparation (so not 'Behavior'), no past attempt (so not 'Attempt'), and the suicidal thoughts are not explicitly unwanted (e.g., no ""I don't want to die""), which would have made it 'Indicator'. While ""trying to survive"" shows distress, it does not negate the suicidal desire; thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""I've given up in life"") and a lack of fear about death (""There is no hell so I'm not scared to die""). It mentions specific suicidal preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" There is no reference to past suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). The desire to live is conditional (""only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family""), implying a genuine wish to die without that constraint. No explicit method (e.g., pills, gun) is described, but the plan, note, and date indicate intended action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it expresses a clear desire for life to end through contextual statements (e.g., not fearing death, conditional will to live). Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are implied as accepted through the plan and date. Thus, explicit intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific preparations are mentioned: ""I have a plan, note and date."" The ""note"" is a clear preparation (suicide note), and the ""date"" (early April) indicates intended action with temporal imminence (specific future timeframe). While no method is detailed, the combination of plan, preparation, and date, coupled with strong intent, implies behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""date which will be in early April"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts). Life events like dropping out or gaining weight are not suicidal actions. Thus, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit desire to die (from Step 2) rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of preparations (note) and intended action (plan and date) elevates this beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. Although the method is vague, the plan and date show concrete intention, aligning with 'Behavior'. No past action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The key factor is the stated plan and preparations for future action.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tell them I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself,"" ""last post ever. Goodbye.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me""), anger, self-harm (""cuts I have all over myself""), feeling like a burden (""best for society if I just stay on the inside"").  
   - Plan/method: Considering two options: (a) checking into a psychiatric ward by telling staff ""I'm going to kill myself,"" or (b) acting on suicidal intent (""actually do go through with it and kill myself"").  
   - Imminence: ""still debating"" but implies urgency (""last post ever. Goodbye"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states personal desire to die via ""kill myself"" without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""kill myself"" as personal desires. No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan**: Details two specific courses of action—seeking hospitalization (with explicit suicide disclosure) or acting on suicide. Mentions psychiatric hospitalization as a means to avoid suicide, but the alternative is an explicit plan to die.  
   - **Preparation**: ""Goodbye"" and ""last post ever"" imply preparatory actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post includes a stated intention to act (""do go through with it"") and a method (""kill myself""), even if vague. Coupled with high imminence (""last post""), this qualifies as a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intentions (""plan on going,"" ""haven't left home yet""). No description of past initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Self-harm (""cuts"") is noted but framed as existing injuries, not a recent suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) is present.  
   - A plan is articulated (hospitalization or suicide), with preparatory signals (""Goodbye""). This elevates it to **Behavior**.  
   - No past self-initiated lethal actions described, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - Intent is clear and not negated, ruling out **Indicator**.  
   - Vagueness of method (""kill myself"") is offset by high imminence and explicit intent to act.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions explicit suicidal intent with phrases like ""i can't kill myself"" and ""im suicidal,"" indicating a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Im so tired,"" ""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself,"" ""there's no me at this point""). A specific method is referenced (""i know a good clif"" – implying jumping off a cliff as a means), and the location is described (4-5km away). However, the author states an inability to act: ""i just can't commit to it."" There is no mention of preparations (e.g., going to the cliff, writing a note) or past actions like attempts. Imminence is low, as the author emphasizes their inability to act rather than any plan or timeline. The desire to die is genuine but conflicted, with no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide (""i can't kill myself,"" ""im suicidal"") and expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""i can't kill myself"" (implying the wish exists but is thwarted) and the overall tone of despair. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the distress stems from an inability to act, not a rejection of the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (jumping off a cliff) and location are mentioned, but the author explicitly states they cannot commit to it (""i just can't commit to it""). There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, going to the location) or intended action. The context shows high desire but low imminence and no actionable plan, as the method is acknowledged but not pursued.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and feelings but no past or recent initiated actions. References to telling someone about being suicidal are disclosures, not suicidal actions. No attempt or self-initiated lethal action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), falling under 'Ideation' or potentially 'Behavior' due to the method mention. However, the author negates any plan or action (""can't commit""), so there is no indication of preparation, imminent intent, or behavior toward suicide. The method reference alone, without intent or imminence, is insufficient for 'Behavior'. There is no past action for 'Attempt'. The thoughts are not explicitly unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want these thoughts""), so 'Indicator' does not apply. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the desire without actionable plan or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress: exhaustion, self-hatred, hopelessness, worthlessness (""i have nothing going for me""), and a desire for cessation (""i just want it all to stop""). 
   - Mentions include ""i wish i was never born"" and ""i'm tired of my life,"" but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**. 
   - Timeframe is ongoing (""every night,"" ""everyday""), with no imminence. 
   - The core desire is for emotional pain to end (""i just want it all to stop""), not a stated wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **No explicit mentions** of suicide, killing oneself, or direct death-desiring phrases (e.g., ""I want to die""). 
   - ""I wish I was never born"" reflects regret about existence but **not a current desire to end life**. ""I just want it all to stop"" expresses distress, not suicidal intent. 
   - **No suicidal thoughts are mentioned at all**, unwanted or otherwise.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - **None identified**. No references to plans, tools, locations, or actions related to self-harm/suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Describes ongoing feelings, **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, preparations) mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **No explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt** is present. 
   - Expressions like ""tired of my life"" and ""wish I was never born"" indicate severe distress and hopelessness but **lack personal suicidal intent** required for 'Ideation'. 
   - Falls under **'Indicator'**: The post signals severe psychological distress and risk factors (e.g., hopelessness, isolation) without expressing current suicidal thoughts, desire, plans, or behaviors.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit suicidal intent: ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""depressed,"" ""shit show""), feeling unsupported (mother's dismissive response), anger (""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family,"" ""last big fuck you"").  
   - Mentions a specific outcome (funeral) tied to suicide but **no explicit plan, method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., no pills, notes, timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - Describes future intent (""can't wait"") but no past/current actions initiated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself"" and ties it to a desired outcome (funeral as retaliation).  
   - **No** indication thoughts are unwanted; the tone is defiant/committed (""last big fuck you"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means).  
   - Vague action (""kill myself"") + high emotion/imminence (""can't wait"") but **no actionable plan or method implied**. Funeral mention is a consequence, not preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **future intent** (""can't wait to kill myself"").  
   - **No description of past/initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

   - **No plan/method/preparation** (despite high intent/imminence) rules out *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains key elements: explicit mention of ending life (""end it all""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and isolation (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care""), a specific timeframe for action (""wait a few weeks""), a stated method (""I already know how I'm gonna do it""), and a farewell (""goodbye everybody""). There is a reference to past actions (""tried that before""), but it refers to telling others about distress, not a suicide attempt. The desire to die is personal and current, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""end it all"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, and the context shows a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I'm finally ready""). There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""), so it is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method is implied (""I already know how I'm gonna do it""), and there is an intended action with a specific timeframe (""wait a few weeks""). Preparations are not detailed, but the knowledge of ""how"" and the stated readiness indicate planning. Coupled with high intent and moderate imminence, this meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""gonna wait a few weeks,"" ""gonna do it"") and references a past non-suicidal action (telling others, which was ineffective). No past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content expresses a personal desire to die (ruling out 'Indicator') and includes a plan/method (implied but known to the author), so it is not 'Ideation'. The absence of a described past suicide attempt rules out 'Attempt'. The combination of explicit suicidal intent with a method and intended action (even if vague) fits 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses hopelessness and despair (""depressed 16 year old""), feeling like a burden (""family doesn't like... but doesn't even deal with him""), and explicitly states, ""how about i die then, is that what you ask for?"".  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""pills,"" ""jump"") are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or self-initiated actions.  
   - The phrase ""how about i die then"" directly expresses a desire for death as a response to family neglect.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: The statement ""how about i die then"" is a direct expression of a personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"")—it is framed as a rhetorical offer/solution.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **No method/preparation**: No tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are referenced. The statement is impulsive (""Well shit..."") but lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - **No past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts or initiated self-harm.  
   - **Future intent**: The desire to die is present, but without specificity or imminence (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation vs. Indicator**: Explicit desire to die (""how about i die then"") confirms suicidal intent. No ambiguity about unwanted thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").

   - Specific plan/method: No concrete method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned. However, a timeframe is stated (""not live to see my 40th birthday in 2023"").  
   - Preparation: References a daily computer wallpaper reminder about suicide.  
   - Imminence: Not immediate (""When it will happen I am unsure""), but tied to a future deadline (before 2023).  
   - Desire: Explicit personal wish to die (e.g., ""100% confirmed I will be taking my own life""). No negation of desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life"" are used.  
   - Yes: Clear desire expressed (""100% confirmed,"" ""Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life"").  
   - No indication of unwanted thoughts; desire is affirmed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method: Not specified.  
   - Preparation: Daily wallpaper reminder reinforces intent but is not a tangible step (e.g., acquiring means).  
   - Intended action: Explicit future action (""I will be taking my own life"") with a timeframe (before 2023). This, coupled with high intent (""100% confirmed""), implies planned behavior despite vagueness of method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

33,"I'm so so tired. I'm so tired . My mind , my soul , my heart. I'm tired of being criticized and unloved . I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down . Everyday I want to go back and kill myself . The worse decision I ever made was staying here .",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill myself"" is stated multiple times.
   - Emotional indicators include profound despair (""I'm so tired,"" ""tired of being criticized and unloved""), hopelessness, and regret.
   - There is a reference to a past opportunity for suicide 6 months ago, where the author considered acting but did not (""I was a pussy,"" ""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). This is not described as an initiated action (e.g., no details of method, preparation, or actual attempt).
   - Current suicidal desire is expressed: ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself,"" indicating persistent ideation without specifics on method, plan, or imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or immediate timeframe).
   - The author's desire to die is clear and not negated; regret over not acting reinforces this intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself"" and expresses a genuine personal desire to die (e.g., ""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself,"" regret for not acting). Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned for current or future actions. The past reference (""perfect opportunity"") is vague and historical, not current planning. Desire is ongoing but lacks actionable details or imminence.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references a past event (6 months ago) where the author had suicidal thoughts but did not initiate any action (e.g., ""talked myself down"" implies no attempt was made). This is not a description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action, so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'. Current content focuses on persistent ideation without action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - No plan, method, preparation, or imminent intended action is described for current suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - The past reference is not an initiated action (only consideration/regret), so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
   - The core of the post is a current, personal expression of wanting to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"") without behavioral elements, fitting 'Ideation'.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of weakness, embarrassment, hopelessness (""I know it's never gonna happen""), and self-deprecation (""I'm pathetic,"" ""I'm too weak"").  
   - Mentions interpersonal conflict (friend dating ex, feeling used) and a failed ultimatum.  
   - **No references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, worthlessness (""being used by everyone""), and despair about the situation.  
   - **No stated desire for life to end, suicide, or death.** Distress is centered on social dynamics and self-perception.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mentions** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - **No expressions of a desire to die or for life to end** (e.g., no phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I wish I were dead""). Distress is relational (""I just want things to be normal"").  
   - **No discussion of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No indication** of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., notes), or imminent actions related to self-harm/suicide.  
   - Content focuses entirely on emotional turmoil and social interactions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past relational actions** (setting an ultimatum, forgiving) but **no references to past or recent self-injurious actions, attempts, or preparations.**  
   - **No initiated suicidal actions described.**  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **general distress, hopelessness, and low self-worth** but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, ideation, plan, method, or past attempt.  
   - Phrases like ""I'm pathetic"" or ""I'm too weak"" reflect self-criticism and despair but **do not imply a wish to die or suicidal intent**.  
   - **Fits 'Indicator'**: Distress is present, but there is no evidence of suicidal thoughts, desire, plan, or behavior. Explicitly unwanted suicidal thoughts are absent.  
   - *Not Ideation/Behavior/Attempt*: No desire to die, no plan/method, no past suicidal actions.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of hollowness, sadness, hopelessness (""I feel hollow,"" ""I feel nothing but sadness,"" ""It hurts so bad""), self-hatred (""God I fucking hate myself""), and a desire to escape reality (""I just want to not exist,"" ""I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land"").  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself"" is explicitly metaphorical and not literal. ""I just want to not exist"" implies a passive wish for non-existence but not an active desire for death.  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness, despair, anhedonia (e.g., no lasting happiness), feelings of being misunderstood or a burden.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Past actions: No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.  
   - Imminence: No indication of immediate plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - Stated desire: The desire expressed (""I just want to not exist"") is passive and focused on escape from pain, not an explicit, current intent to die. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""Kill myself"" is used metaphorically, so no direct expression (No).  
   - Clear desire to die: Phrases like ""I just want to not exist"" and ""I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land"" suggest a passive wish for life to end or escape, but not an active, personal desire for death. It aligns with profound hopelessness (e.g., similar to ""I hate living""), implying suicidal ideation. However, the desire is not explicitly negated as unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""), so this leans toward Ideation.  
   - Unwanted thoughts: No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts, so not Indicator.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations described.  
   - No intended actions or plans implied, even vaguely. The metaphorical ""kill myself"" refers to overworking, not suicide.  
   - With no plan/method and low imminence, this cannot be Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses current feelings and past emotional experiences (e.g., not enjoying birthdays for years), but no past or recent suicidal actions are described.  
   - No initiated suicide attempts mentioned, so Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core issue is distinguishing between Indicator and Ideation. The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" is a strong expression of wanting life to end, comparable to ""I hate living,"" which the guidelines classify as Ideation. There is no explicit negation of suicidal desire, and the emotional context (e.g., self-hatred, hopelessness) supports a genuine personal wish for non-existence.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation exists, ruling out Behavior. No past actions are described, ruling out Attempt.  
   - Since suicidal desire is implied through passive ideation and not ambiguous/unwanted, the post fits Ideation best.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit expressions of suicidal desire: ""i just want to end it,"" ""i just want to put a bullet right through it,"" ""i dont want to be here anymore,"" ""i just want to die"" (repeatedly), ""i hate being alive"" (repeatedly).
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""im tired of feeling worthless""), despair (""im losing my mind,"" ""cant take it anymore""), self-loathing (""i hate myself"").
   - **Specific method mentioned**: ""put a bullet right through it"" (direct reference to using a gun).
   - **Lack of explicit negation**: The writer expresses frustration about not acting (""i dont have the balls to take my own life"") but does *not* state they *do not want* to die or that thoughts are unwanted. The core sentiment is a genuine desire for death.
   - **No past actions described**: Focus is on current desires, not past attempts.
   - **Imminence**: No explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but extreme distress is evident.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""end it,"" ""take my own life,"" and repeated ""i just want to die."" ""I hate being alive"" is a strong expression of desire for life to end. No negation of desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""put a bullet right through it"") is explicitly mentioned in direct association with suicidal intent (""i just want to""). No preparations or plans beyond the method reference, but the specificity of the method (firearm) qualifies.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts/desire. **No past or recent initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). The phrase ""i dont have the balls to take my own life"" implies inaction, not a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die is present and *not* framed as unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Not Ideation**: While desire is clear, the mention of a specific method (""bullet"") moves this beyond passive ideation.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a self-initiated past or recent lethal action.  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die *and* reference to a specific method (firearm) satisfies the criteria for Behavior. The frustration about inaction does not negate the presence of method-specific intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" and specific method ""take a bunch of pills.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""wasn't made for life,"" ""too painful,"" ""loathe myself,"" ""better if I was dead,"" hopelessness about progress.  
   - Specific plan/method: ""take a bunch of pills while everyone's asleep.""  
   - Imminence: Not immediate (""could take,"" indicating contemplation, not imminent action).  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""wish I could just fucking end it""), though conflicted by fear and concern for mother.  
   - Past actions: None described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" and ""wish I could just fucking end it"" confirm personal desire to die.  
   - Conflicting feelings (fear, guilt) do not negate the core desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""take a bunch of pills"") and plan (""while everyone's asleep"") are stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **future intention** (""could take pills""), not a past/initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong desire to die + specific method/plan = **Behavior**.  
   - Fear/conflict (""too scared"") does not override the presence of a plan.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post primarily focuses on the author's concern for a friend who is considering suicide (""Friend may kill himself soon"", ""he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days)""). 
   - The author discloses their **own** history: past suicidal ideation (""I have been suicidal on-and-off"") and a **past suicide attempt** (""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded""). 
   - The author explicitly states they are currently stable (""I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months""). 
   - No current personal desire to die, plan, method, or preparation is expressed by the author. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT (for the author)**:
   - The author mentions past suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they currently have **no ideation** (""haven't had suicidal ideation in months""). 
   - Phrases like ""I have been suicidal"" refer to past states, not current desire. No present expressions of wanting to die. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION (for the author)**:
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the author. The only actionable detail is the historical attempt (""attempt in 2009""). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT (for the author)**:
   - The author describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded."" This qualifies as an 'Attempt' per the rules, regardless of timeframe. 
   - The author links this to their current perspective (""provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author’s disclosure of a past suicide attempt (""attempt in 2009"") meets the 'Attempt' definition: a **specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**. 
   - Rules state: **'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described**, even if historical. The absence of *current* ideation/behavior does not negate this. 
   - Current risk is low (no ideation/plan), but the category reflects the disclosure of a past attempt by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions ""lol kermit sewer slide"" thoughts (a coded slang for ""commit suicide""), which are persistent (""even on days where I'm actually happy"") and described as ""tempting."" 
    - Expresses emotional distress: fear therapy won't work, shame, self-criticism (""lazy bitch""), hopelessness about self-improvement, and exhaustion (""tired of always being afraid"").
    - No specific suicide plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no notes, acquiring means). 
    - No past or recent suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted"").
    - Imminence: Thoughts are ongoing but not tied to a timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
    - Desire: Suicidal thoughts are framed as intrusive (""thoughts"") and resisted (""tempting""), but **no explicit statement negating desire** (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die""). Phrases like ""tempting"" imply conflict but not unambiguous rejection.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes, ""kermit sewer slide"" is a direct euphemism for suicide. 
    - Yes, expressions like ""tempting a lot of the time"" imply a current personal struggle with the desire to act, even if conflicted. The lack of explicit negation (e.g., ""I don’t want this"") leans toward genuine ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations. 
    - No implied plan or intended action (e.g., ""thinking of doing X,"" ""going to Y""). 
    - High imminence is absent; thoughts are generalized.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes ongoing thoughts, not past actions. No reference to prior attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die is present (coded suicide reference + ""tempting""), but no plan/method/preparation. The absence of explicit unwanted thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts"") rules out 'Indicator'. 
    - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/intended action. 
    - **Not Attempt**: No past/current initiated lethal action.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""slitting my wrists"" as a specific method related to suicide/self-harm. Emotional indicators include ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" and ""feeling more alone,"" indicating hopelessness and despair. The phrase ""thought about... today, but i didnt do it"" references a recent suicidal thought without action. There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) or imminence of action (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer explicitly states no action was taken, focusing on thoughts and emotional distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""thought about slitting my wrists"" implies a personal desire to die through a specific method, though not phrased as ""I want to die."" The thought is not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want these thoughts""); instead, the lack of action (""but i didnt do it"") suggests resistance but not a negation of the desire itself.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, but it is framed as a thought, not an intended action or plan. There are no signs of preparation, imminence, or intent to act (e.g., no ""I will do it"" or ""I have a plan""). The context indicates only ideation, not behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a recent thought (""today"") but explicitly states no action was initiated (""but i didnt do it""). No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts with a method but no plan, preparation, or intended action. The lack of action and no explicit statement of unwanted thoughts rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a method in thought alone, without behavioral elements, aligns with 'Ideation' (defined as expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire without plan or action). 'Behavior' is not applicable due to the absence of planning or intent to act, and 'Attempt' is ruled out by the lack of initiated action.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" - explicit reference to personal suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: shame, regret over past dental neglect due to depression, hopelessness about dental pain impacting quality of life.
   - No mention of death/dying methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions. Focus is on feelings returning due to current distress.
   - Writer expresses distress about dental issues and returning suicidal feelings but does not negate or reject these feelings (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on them"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back."" This is a personal expression of recurring suicidal thoughts without negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No: No reference to plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations, or imminent intent. The post focuses on emotional distress and physical pain.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or current suicidal actions described. The only past reference is to depression affecting hygiene, not suicidal behavior. ""Suicidal feelings are coming back"" indicates current ideation without action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit personal desire to die is indicated (""suicidal feelings""), fitting 'Ideation'.
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past/current initiated suicidal actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Lack of negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") and explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts distinguishes this from 'Indicator'.

Conclusion: The core of the post expresses recurring personal suicidal ideation in response to distress, with no plan, method, or action described.

44,"If you could help. Could one of you help me? I just need to be able to buy basic necessities stuff for me and my dog. I know this is not the right subreddit to post this stuff but in fact i'm someone who wants to die and that is one of the reasons i'm not within the rules for posting to the correct subs. If you want more information and are interested in helping, I can explain it better in the chat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes a request for help with basic necessities, but key elements are the phrase ""i'm someone who wants to die,"" which explicitly expresses a personal desire to die. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, self-harm actions, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or timeframes indicating imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). No past suicidal actions are described. The emotional context involves distress and hopelessness linked to the desire to die, but there is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""i'm someone who wants to die,"" which is a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end. It does not use direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""wants to die"" is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""), so this leans strongly toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation, or intended action is mentioned or implied. The reference to wanting to die is general and not coupled with any details about how, when, or where it might occur. Despite the expression of desire, the absence of any plan, method, or imminent action means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current state (""i'm someone who wants to die"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). The context is solely about present feelings, not historical events. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expression ""wants to die"" indicates a personal desire to die, falling under 'Ideation' (desire/thoughts without plan/method). It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal thought is not framed as unwanted or abstract (e.g., no distress about the thoughts themselves without desire). There is no plan or action to escalate to 'Behavior', and no past action for 'Attempt'. The mention of wanting to die is direct and personal, making 'Ideation' the best fit.

45,Anyone know how to write good suicide notes? I'm leaving soon but need my loved ones to know I love them so much but I don't know how to put it all into words. Don't say please don't go. Stay. My minds made up. I just need help on the goodbye letters,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" indicating preparation for suicide. Phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up"" show a clear, imminent intention to die. Emotional indicators include expressing love for loved ones (potentially reflecting guilt or burden), and firm decision-making (""Don't say please don't go. Stay. My minds made up""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, or substances), but writing suicide notes is a recognized preparation step. The timeframe is future-oriented (""leaving soon""), with no references to past actions. The writer's desire to die is explicit and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes,"" directly referencing suicide. It expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""My minds made up,"" which, in context, convey a personal wish for life to end. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the decision is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the request for help writing ""suicide notes"" or ""goodbye letters"" constitutes explicit preparation for suicide. This is coupled with high imminence (""leaving soon"") and firm intent (""My minds made up""). Vague references to action in this context imply a plan, aligning with the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions and current preparations (writing notes), with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to a prior attempt). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit suicidal desire (Ideation-level), but the mention of preparing suicide notes elevates it to 'Behavior' due to the preparatory action. There is no ambiguity: the desire is personal and not unwanted, and preparation is present. High imminence (""leaving soon"") further supports 'Behavior'. 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action is described. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent, and 'Ideation' is insufficient because of the preparation element.

46,"It's been 10 yrs of the worst of this hell, 8 yrs of constant attempts but obv I wasn't trying hard enough. enough is enough. This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long). currently waiting to see my psychiatrist who I don't trust anymore as I TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul in this entire world anymore because of long history of trauma/ptsd and shit but then bc of trauma from a few days ago that literally I told all the 'professionals' about and they didn't care btw it was them fucking me over (cops physically and verbally abused me, and I told the hospital staff and they didn't care and just watched them continue to do it and took part in some stuff too) I'm fucking done. only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live if I could get the help I need right now but bc of my city and it's healthcare system and workers and how they view me bc of how much I struggle with sh/suicidality they just treat me like shit or are done with me. I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: 
     - Mentions of suicide: ""suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon,"" ""didn't die last night,"" and references to past attempts.
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""hell,"" ""enough is enough,"" ""I'm fucking done""), despair (""I TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul""), trauma history, and feeling mistreated by professionals.
     - Specific plans and methods: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it (doubt ill make it that long)"" indicates a specific, imminent plan with a timeframe. The phrase ""end thing v v soon"" reinforces imminence, though no explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) is detailed.
     - Preparations: None explicitly mentioned (e.g., no note, means acquisition), but the setting of a date implies intention.
     - References to past actions: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""only reason I didn't die last night"" clearly describe past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (attempts). ""Last night"" is very recent, and ""8 yrs"" is historical, both linked to current feelings.
     - Imminence: High, with ""this Friday"" or sooner (""v v soon,"" ""doubt ill make it that long"").
     - Stated desire: Ambivalence is present (""I actually wanna live if I could get the help""), but this is conditional and overridden by explicit intent to act (""suicide date,"" ""end thing""), indicating a genuine desire to die if help isn't received.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide date"" and ""end thing,"" which are direct references to suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or for life to end, e.g., through ""suicide date,"" ""end thing,"" and contextual despair.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; the conditional desire to live (""I actually wanna live if..."") does not negate the current intent, as the author plans imminent action due to perceived lack of help. Thus, this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific plan is mentioned: setting a suicide date (""This Friday, May 14, 2021"") with high imminence (""either that day or before it,"" ""v v soon"").
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are detailed, but the date-setting implies an intended action. Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence, the vague reference to action (""end thing"") coupled with intent leans toward 'Behavior'. However, the presence of past attempts must be prioritized in category reasoning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes both past events and future intentions.
   - Past actions: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""only reason I didn't die last night"" describe specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. ""Last night"" is a very recent attempt that failed (""didn't die""), and ""constant attempts"" over 8 years are historical. These are clearly initiated actions by the author and mentioned in the context of current distress and plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post has elements of multiple categories: explicit desire to die (Ideation), a future plan (Behavior), and clear descriptions of past attempts (Attempt).
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence because the rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" Here, the author describes past/very recent attempts (""last night,"" ""8 yrs of constant attempts""), which are potentially lethal, self-initiated actions. This overshadows the current ideation/behavior.
   - The historical nature (""8 yrs"") does not disqualify it, as it is linked to the author's current state. The ""last night"" event is particularly salient as a recent attempt.
   - Therefore, despite the future plan (which could suggest Behavior), the clear description of past attempts mandates 'Attempt'.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us.

What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""I know I will die by 35,"" ""in my grave I lay,"" ""disappear forever.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""everything's pointless""), despair (""sick of everybody""), rejection of life (""I want to be the missing pixel... nobody ever finds"").  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly states ""I want to disappear forever"" and ties death to a personal timeline (""die by 35... outer limit"").  
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).  
   - No references to past suicidal actions.  
   - Imminence: Future-oriented (""die by 35,"" currently 22).  
   - Stated desire: Unambiguously expresses a wish to cease existing, with no negation of this desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" (in despair context) indicate a **genuine desire for life to end**. No negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act""). → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes), or imminent actions. The timeline (""by 35"") is distant and lacks actionable intent. → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""will die by 35"") and abstract desires (""disappear forever""). **No description of past/initiated self-harm actions**. → Not Attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Strong personal desire to die (""disappear forever,"" ""die by 35"") without plans/methods. Phrases like ""I want to disappear forever"" and rejecting life constitute explicit suicidal ideation.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire is personal, current, and not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.

I'm trying to die not end up brain damaged. Shits difficult 😎",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions methods of suicide: hanging (""hanging myself"") and pills (""taking these pills""). It discusses the effectiveness of these methods in the context of the author's body size (""being fat makes it that much harder"").
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""Shits difficult"") and a focus on practical barriers, but the core sentiment is a desire to die, as stated directly (""I'm trying to die"").
   - Specific plans or preparations are not mentioned (e.g., no notes, acquiring means, or imminent actions). However, the author is evaluating methods (hanging and pills) to avoid non-lethal outcomes like brain damage, indicating active consideration of how to act.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts). The post is about current thoughts and hypothetical scenarios.
   - Imminence is not indicated; there are no time-specific references (e.g., ""tonight""). The tone is contemplative, with humor (😂, 😎) possibly masking distress.
   - The writer's stated desire is clear: ""I'm trying to die,"" expressing a genuine wish to end life, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" (in reference to the author) and ""I'm trying to die,"" showing direct suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die, with phrases like ""I'm trying to die"" confirming a personal wish for life to end.
   - No, the suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or negated; the author is actively engaging with them to achieve death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: hanging and pill overdose. The author is assessing their feasibility (""idk if hanging myself would even work,"" ""idk if taking these pills would work"").
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no notes, goodbyes, or acquired means) are described.
   - Coupled with explicit desire to die, the method discussion implies an intended action, but the uncertainty and lack of imminence or concrete steps make it less definitive. However, the presence of specific methods (even with doubts) leans toward 'Behavior' per the rules, as the author is problem-solving for a lethal outcome.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions, not past events. There is no mention of any initiated action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").
   - No past potentially lethal actions are referenced, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm trying to die"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires lack of personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - 'Ideation' involves desire without a plan/method, but here specific methods (hanging and pills) are discussed in the context of acting on suicidal intent, moving it toward 'Behavior'.
   - 'Behavior' applies because the post mentions specific methods and an intended action (e.g., ""trying to die"" while evaluating methods), despite uncertainty about effectiveness. The rules state that mentioning a specific method, even briefly, supports 'Behavior' when desire is present.
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no past or recent initiated actions are described.
   - Imminence is low, but the method discussion is explicit, so ambiguity is resolved in favor of 'Behavior' per the rules: ""if explicit desire to die is present and there is any mention of a method, it leans towards 'Behavior'.""

Final classification: 'behavior' due to explicit suicidal desire coupled with specific method consideration.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""want to die"" and feeling ""depressed and numb,"" expressing hopelessness (""Everything is so much effort,"" ""sick of everything"").  
   - Explicitly states ""I want to die"" but **immediately negates intent to act**: ""probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up.""  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions. Focuses on uncertainty about seeking help and fear of not being taken seriously.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as passive distress, not actionable intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") is present.  
   - **Crucially, the desire is negated**: Writer states they won’t act due to fear of failure. Thoughts are **unwanted** (implied by seeking safety via hospitalization).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""pills"" in the context of counting them nightly and regretting not taking them all, implying potential overdose.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""living a life nobody loves or cares for me"") and self-blame (""why am I such a coward"").  
   - Indicates recurring thoughts of action (counting pills nightly, daily regret for inaction).  
   - No explicit past action described (e.g., ""I took pills but survived""); focuses on *contemplation* of taking pills.  
   - Imminence is ongoing (""every night,"" ""every day"") but no specific future timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""take them all"" (pills) implies lethal intent.  
   - Desire to die is strongly implied through regret for not acting (""why I didn’t take them all"") and self-criticism for ""coward[ice].""  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (overdosing via pills) is clearly indicated.  
   - Preparation is evident (""every night I count my pills"").  
   - Coupled with stated intent (regret for not acting), this confirms planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing preparation (counting pills) and recurrent ideation (daily regret).  
   - **No past or recent initiated action**: ""didn’t take them all"" confirms inaction, not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (implied through regret) + specific method (pills) + preparation (counting pills) = **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Attempt"": No description of a past self-initiated lethal action.  
   - Not ""Ideation"": Method and preparation are present.  
   - Not ""Indicator"": Personal desire to die is evident and not negated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: Mentions ""thoughts"" being unbearably strong and a ""downward spiral,"" daily struggle, secrecy to avoid psych ward hospitalization, and helplessness (""don't know what to do""). 
    - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. 
    - Emotional indicators: Distress, overwhelm, and functional impairment (struggling to get through the day) are present, but no explicit hopelessness, despair, burden, or hatred of life. 
    - No stated desire for life to end, no plans/methods, no past actions described. 
    - Imminence: Not applicable (no timeline for action). 
    - Stated desire: Focuses on distress about thoughts and avoiding hospitalization, not on wanting to die. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases. 
    - No expressions of desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I hate living""). 
    - The ""thoughts"" are described as intense and distressing but are never specified as suicidal. The author’s primary concern is avoiding re-hospitalization, not acting on suicidal impulses. 
    - **Conclusion**: No explicit or implied suicidal desire. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - None mentioned. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparatory actions. 
    - **Conclusion**: Absence supports non-behavioral category. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - References past psych ward hospitalization but provides no details about its cause (e.g., no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-harm). 
    - No description of any initiated self-harm or suicidal action (past or present). 
    - **Conclusion**: No evidence of an 'Attempt'. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses significant distress, emotional struggle, and a history of mental health intervention but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal intent, or references to plans/actions. 
    - Vague ""thoughts"" could imply suicidal ideation, but they are never specified as such. Without explicit suicidal content or unwanted suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I have suicidal thoughts but don’t want them""), the ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator'.

I know it sounds so stupid to want to die over not having a boyfriend but it's seriously affecting my mental health.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of emptiness, loneliness, being uncared for, and hopelessness about finding love. Specific phrases like ""lost all will to live"" and ""want to die"" indicate a personal desire for life to end. Rejections from dating are mentioned as the cause, but there are no references to suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., attempts). No timeframe for imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is present. The desire to die is stated directly but not explicitly negated as unwanted; it's framed as a genuine feeling stemming from relationship struggles.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""want to die,"" which is a clear personal expression of a desire for life to end. ""Lost all will to live"" further reinforces this intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to feel this way""), so the desire appears genuine and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses on emotional pain and a general desire to die without any reference to how, when, or where the person might act. There is no indication of imminence or intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and past dating rejections, but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. All suicidal expressions are in the context of present thoughts and emotions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""want to die"" and ""lost all will to live"") rules out 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' requires either no personal suicidal intent or explicitly unwanted thoughts. The absence of any plan, method, preparation, or action means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. With no description of past initiated lethal actions, 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation'—it expresses a personal desire to die or for life to end without indications of planning or action.

53,what kind of impact will my death have on my mother?. I don't want to live anymore and i cant keep living with depression. i don't want to ruin my mum's mental state when i off myself but i can't continue to live for decades to come.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""my death,"" ""off myself"" (a direct reference to suicide), and expresses a strong desire to end life: ""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""i cant keep living with depression,"" and ""i can't continue to live for decades to come."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feeling burdened by depression. There is concern about the impact on the mother, but no specific method, plan, preparation, or location for suicide is mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, or actions like writing a note). The phrase ""when i off myself"" implies an intention but is vague and not tied to imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). There are no references to past suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide through ""off myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die with phrases like ""I don't want to live anymore."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""). The desire is affirmed, not rejected.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. ""Off myself"" is a general reference to suicide but lacks detail on how or when it would be carried out. Imminence is not high—phrases like ""can't continue to live for decades"" suggest a longer-term struggle rather than immediate action. With no plan, method, or intended action described, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions, with no description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and intent, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts). With no plan, method, or preparation, it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. The lack of any described past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. The content fits 'Ideation' due to the personal expression of wanting to die without actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""killing myself"" explicitly. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""what's the fucking point in any of this""), despair about life circumstances (inability to afford treatment, financial stress), and a sense of being trapped (""i need help... but can't afford""). No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no pills, guns, notes). The suicidal thought is framed as a future possibility (""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself"") due to building frustration, with no stated imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die as a solution (""because what's the point in not""), not as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide. It also expresses a clear desire to die through statements like ""what's the point in not"" [killing myself], implying that life has no value. Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; they are presented as a likely outcome of the writer's distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no reference to overdosing, weapons, or notes). The phrase ""killing myself"" is general and vague. While there is high intent and despair, the lack of any concrete plan or means, coupled with the conditional/future framing (""going to end up"" suggests it may happen later, not imminently), means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current distress and a future intention (""i know that i'm going to end up...""), but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions are described (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt). The focus is on potential future behavior, not a historical event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""what's the point in not""), which fits 'Ideation'. However, there is no mention of a plan, method, intended action, or preparations, ruling out 'Behavior'. The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to""), so it is not 'Indicator'. No past or recent initiated actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Despite the strong despair, the vagueness and lack of specificity in method/plan support 'Ideation'.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes ""tried to kms yesterday"" (""kms"" is shorthand for ""kill myself""), indicating a past self-initiated suicidal action. It also mentions ""depressed af"" (depressed as hell), which shows emotional distress. The phrase ""You look like you're about to die"" is a quote from someone else and not the author's personal expression.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""tried to kms"" explicitly references suicide and implies a personal desire to die at the time of the action. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no details on how the attempt was made). However, this step is less critical since the post describes a past action rather than current plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday."" This is a specific, self-initiated action by the author that was potentially lethal, occurring recently (""yesterday""). The word ""tried"" confirms initiation of an action, fitting the definition of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of a past suicidal action (""tried to kms yesterday""). According to the rules, 'Attempt' applies to past or recent self-initiated actions, regardless of when they occurred, as long as they are described by the author. The mention of depression and the quote from the mother provide context but do not change the focus on the past attempt. This overrides any current emotional indicators (e.g., ""depressed af"") because the attempt is clearly stated. There is no indication of current plans or methods, so 'Behavior' does not apply. The explicit action rules out 'Indicator' (no unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (thoughts without action).

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""non painful way to do this"" (vague reference to method), ""I cant live anymore,"" ""I absolutely cannot fight anymore,"" and ""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I cant fight anymore""), despair (""I cant live anymore""), and prolonged suffering.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. ""Non painful way"" is vague and lacks actionable detail.  
   - No reference to past suicidal actions.  
   - Imminence is not stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - The phrase ""I cant live anymore"" expresses a desire for life to end but does not explicitly negate or reject this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: ""I cant live anymore"" is a direct expression of wanting life to end in a context of despair (similar to ""I hate living""). No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - ""Non painful way to do this"" hints at considering methods but is overly vague and lacks specificity (no tool, substance, location, or plan).  
   - No preparations mentioned.  
   - Despite despair, vagueness and lack of imminence/intent details prevent classification as 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes current suffering and desire to end life. No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""I cant live anymore"") → Rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation** (vague ""non painful way"" insufficient for 'Behavior') → Rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/initiated lethal action** → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Best fit: **Ideation** (clear desire to die without plan/method/action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide note,"" indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Specific method: ""with drugs"" is stated, and preparations are mentioned (""write a suicide note"").
   - Timeframe: ""next week"" shows imminence and intent to act soon.
   - Emotional indicators: The author expresses hopelessness about family reactions but justifies the action.
   - Desire: ""I want to kill myself"" is a clear, personal expression of desire to die, with no negation or indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly says ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, the author expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to kill myself"").
   - There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). The desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""with drugs"").
   - Preparations are described (""write a suicide note"").
   - Imminence is high (""next week""), and the context couples intent with concrete steps.
   - This indicates a plan and intended action, moving beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""next week""), not past actions. There is no mention of a past initiated event (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").
   - Therefore, no past behavior qualifies as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires lack of personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - The presence of a method (""drugs"") and preparations (""suicide note"") elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method/action).
   - It fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of desire, method, preparation, and imminence.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or initiated action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""life is so cyclic,"" ""i have no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely""), despair (""i'm tired of being sick,"" ""none of the pills do enough""), feelings of being a burden (""pushing everyone away, saying hurtful things""), anhedonia (lack of motivation, envy of others' joy), and general distress (financial struggles, academic pressure, isolation). The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" is ambiguous but could imply a desire for relief from suffering. However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No references to past suicidal actions or preparations are present. The temporal context for ""soon"" is vague and not tied to imminent action. The writer's stated desire centers on exhaustion and frustration with life circumstances, not a clear wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. While ""get this over with"" could be interpreted as a desire for life to end, it is not a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). The phrase is ambiguous—it could refer to ending their current struggles without implying death. There are no suicidal thoughts described as unwanted or wanted; the focus is on emotional pain and life dissatisfaction. Without explicit suicidal desire or negation, this leans toward 'Indicator' for distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means). The phrase ""get this over with soon"" lacks detail on how it would be carried out, and there is no coupling with high imminence or intent that would imply a method. Even if interpreted as a desire to act, the vagueness and absence of concrete details do not support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and frustrations but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). The mention of ""like I did on Thanksgiving"" refers to getting fast food, not a suicidal act. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows strong distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""i'm ready to get this over with"" are concerning but ambiguous and not equivalent to explicit ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""). Without suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), plan, method, or past action, this fits 'Indicator'. The primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances, not a stated wish for death. If suicidal desire were present, it would be 'Ideation', but here it is not explicit or implied strongly enough. No elements support 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""overdosed"" as a specific method of self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: regret, suffering, self-blame (""punish me for being such a nuisance"").
   - Specific action taken: ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" (method and dose specified).
   - Timeframe: Action is recent (""it hasn't been that long"") with current physical symptoms (""headache"").
   - Ambivalence: ""I regret it. I also don't"" and explicit negation of death wish (""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicitly states ""I don't want to die,"" negating active desire for death. The primary driver is ending suffering, not suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**
   - Method is clearly stated (""overdosed,"" ""took 500mg Zoloft"").
   - Action has already been initiated (past tense: ""have overdosed,"" ""took"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a **recent, self-initiated, potentially harmful action** (overdose) with acknowledgment of ongoing effects (""headache""). The author explicitly links the act to self-punishment, confirming intent behind the action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is a **completed self-initiated action** (overdose), qualifying as an 'Attempt' regardless of stated lethality (""won't kill me"") or ambivalence. The action is recent and described firsthand. Current distress or ideation (""want my suffering to be over"") does not override the historical/recent action. 'Attempt' takes precedence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" which implies a suicidal action, though the method is not specified. Emotional indicators include feeling ""at peace"" and being ""ready to go,"" suggesting acceptance and readiness for death. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or explicit preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The timeframe ""in the near future"" indicates imminence but not immediacy (e.g., not ""tonight""). The writer expresses a clear desire to end life, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""doing it"" and ""ready to go"" are strong euphemisms implying suicide. The phrases ""knowing I'm going to"" and ""I'm ready"" convey a genuine personal desire to die, with no expression of distress about the thoughts or a wish to avoid acting on them. Thus, explicit intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. Spending time with a favorite person could be interpreted as emotional preparation, but it is not explicitly tied to suicide (e.g., not described as a ""goodbye""). The phrase ""I'm doing it"" indicates an intended action, and coupled with the imminence of ""near future,"" it suggests a plan. However, the vagueness of ""it"" and the lack of concrete details create ambiguity about a specific plan or method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""I'm doing it in the near future"") with no reference to past actions or attempts. It describes current feelings and readiness but no initiated lethal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit desire to die (""ready to go,"" ""knowing I'm going to"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no past or recent self-initiated lethal action is described.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The key distinction is whether there is a plan, method, or intended action. The phrase ""I'm doing it"" implies an intended action, and the imminence (""near future"") heightens the risk. However, the method is vague and no preparations are specified, making it ambiguous. Per the rules, when imminence and intent are high but the plan/method is vague, lean towards 'Behavior' if the action is clearly intended. Here, the declaration ""I'm doing it"" with peace and readiness strongly indicates an intended action, so 'Behavior' is more appropriate than 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post mentions past suicidality (""i was suicidal"") but frames it as a historical event (""4 yrs ago""). 
    - There are no explicit expressions of *current* desire to die, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, or death. 
    - No methods, plans, preparations, or imminent intentions are described. 
    - The focus is on recounting a negative institutional response to past suicidal disclosure, not expressing current risk. 
    - Emotional tone reflects frustration/anger about the school's handling, not current despair or hopelessness.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No** explicit current desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The phrase ""i was suicidal"" is past-tense and contextualized as a memory. 
    - **No** phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living"" in the present. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **None** mentioned for current or future actions. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes a past disclosure of suicidality (""i was suicidal"") to school staff. 
    - **No** description of a past *initiated self-harm action* by the author (e.g., no mention of an attempt, taking pills, etc.). The phrase ""i was suicidal"" indicates past ideation or disclosure, not a past attempt. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses distress about a past experience but lacks any current personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior. 
    - Past suicidal disclosure (""i was suicidal"") is mentioned abstractly in the context of criticizing the school's response, not as an expression of current intent or desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains direct questions: ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ends with ""Might as well just die.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), despair (""unexplainable void and sadness""), self-loathing (""pretty shit person""), and isolation.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions initiated by the author.  
   - The desire to die is explicit but not accompanied by actionable intent (e.g., ""go and kill myself"" is framed as a rhetorical question, not a declaration of imminent action).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""Might as well just die.""  
   - **Yes**: Strong expressions of desire to die (e.g., ""nothing will make me happier"" reinforcing futility).  
   - **No**: Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as logical conclusions to despair.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, preparation, or imminent action (""tonight,"" ""soon"") is mentioned. The query ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" is hypothetical, not a stated plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings and abstract considerations of suicide.  
   - **No** description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).

   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""just die"") and hopelessness confirm **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past/current initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Thoughts are not explicitly unwanted (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this""), so **Indicator** does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of death/suicide: ""i should die,"" ""kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), burden (""they have to support me""), self-hatred, and despair.
   - Plan/preparation: ""I have prepared everything"" explicitly states completed preparations for suicide. 
   - Temporal context: ""a few days"" ago, the author made a decision and completed preparations. No description of a past *initiated* lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" and ""i should die"" indicate a personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - ""I have prepared everything"" confirms concrete preparations for suicide, directly tied to stated intent. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes a past decision (""made up my mind a few days"") and completed preparations but **no description of an initiated suicidal action** (e.g., no ""I took pills"" or ""I tried""). Thus, no 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + concrete preparations = **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""vanishing without a trace,"" finding a ""secluded spot where no one will find my body,"" and specifically having ""a pistol"" at the end, which implies suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""have nothing to look forward to,"" ""they never seemed to enjoy my company"") and a sense of being a burden. There is a detailed plan: emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot with no traceable items, and intending to use a pistol. Preparations are described (e.g., financial steps, leaving items). The post is future-oriented (""when that happens,"" ""I would want to,"" ""I plan to have""), with no reference to past actions. Imminence is not immediate but contingent on being asked to leave. The writer expresses a genuine desire to die through the plan to vanish and end life.

   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a desire to die through the context of vanishing and ensuring the body isn't found, with the pistol as a means. Expressions like ""vanish without a trace"" and the overall plan convey a clear, personal wish for life to end. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, they are presented as an intended course of action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned (""a pistol"") and strongly implied as the means for suicide. Preparations are detailed: emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, isolating oneself with no phone or car, and walking to a secluded spot. The plan is concrete, with steps to avoid detection. Even though the trigger (being asked to leave) is not immediate, the method and preparations are explicit and coupled with high intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions only; there is no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to previous attempts). The language is prospective (""when that happens,"" ""I would want to,"" ""I plan to have""), focusing on what the writer intends to do when a future event occurs.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit personal desire to die (e.g., through the vanishing plan and pistol reference), which rules out 'Indicator' (as thoughts are not unwanted or abstract). The detailed plan, method (pistol), and preparations (e.g., financial steps, isolation) align with 'Behavior.' There is no past initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 'Ideation' is not appropriate because the plan and method go beyond mere thoughts. The specificity of the method and preparations, even with contingent imminence, confirms 'Behavior.'

65,"I want to die. Title says it all, im tired of seeing racist homophobic ableist anti semetic prople. Im this fucking close, life is shit. We all just fake it till we die and i give up now. it's all scary no one cares, why does no one care? What the fuck have I even become, I don't recognise myself anymore, fuck the mental health system.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" indicating a direct desire for death. It expresses hopelessness (""life is shit,"" ""I give up now""), despair (""it's all scary,"" ""I don't recognise myself anymore""), and feelings of being uncared for (""no one cares""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions like attempts. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" suggests high distress and potential imminence but is vague and does not specify a plan or action. The desire to die is personal and not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I want to die,"" which is a clear and personal expression of a desire to die. Phrases like ""life is shit"" and ""I give up now"" reinforce this intent without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted or rejected by the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) is mentioned. The phrase ""Im this fucking close"" implies high intent and possible imminence but is too vague to indicate a concrete plan or method. Without any reference to how the author might act, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die now,"" ""I give up now""), with no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, self-harm, or preparations). The focus is on present ideation rather than any historical or recent suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") rules out 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any plan, method, preparation, or intended action means this does not qualify as 'Behavior', even with high distress and imminence implied by ""Im this fucking close.""
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions (e.g., attempts) means 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any behavioral elements.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years,"" ""I dont want the existance ive got,"" and references to planning (""decided the woodland where i would do it,"" ""how i will leave notes on the paths"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""rotting away,"" ""disconected""), burden (""bring the mood down""), and despair.
   - Plan/Method: Specific location (woodland), method implied (though not explicitly named, context suggests hanging via ""rope"" reference), and preparations (leaving notes for dog walkers, isolating others to facilitate action).
   - Temporal context: Current suicidal thoughts/desire (""Im on the edge"") and future-oriented plans (""i will leave notes""). No description of past initiated suicidal actions (only historical self-harm as a child, unrelated to suicide).
   - Desire: Explicit personal wish to die (""i dont want the existance ive got"") with no negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""suicidal for 10 years,"" ""i dont want the existance ive got""). No disavowal of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific location (woodland), implied method (rope mentioned earlier), and active preparations (isolating others, planning notes/warnings). High imminence (""on the edge"") reinforces intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on future intent/planning. No past suicide attempt described (only childhood self-harm, not suicidal).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Explicit personal desire to die negates this.  
   - **Ideation?** No. Plan (location, notes), method (implied), and preparations present.  
   - **Behavior?** Yes. Combines explicit desire with specific plans/preparations.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No description of past/current initiated lethal action.  
   - *Key nuance*: ""Ive not gone and got a rope"" shows incomplete preparation but does not negate the broader plan (location, notes, isolation). Coupled with high imminence (""on the edge""), this qualifies as Behavior.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore"" are explicit expressions of suicidal desire.
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I hate my life,"" ""I got everything taken away from me""), anger (""I fucking hate my mom""), and despair.
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned. ""Off myself"" is a vague colloquialism for suicide but lacks concrete details.
   - Temporal context: Describes current distress and frustration. No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Stated desire: Expresses a genuine wish to die (""I wanna off myself,"" ""don't even wanna live"") without negation or indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""I wanna off myself"" is a direct phrase implying suicide. ""I don’t even wanna live anymore"" explicitly expresses a desire for life to end.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""off myself"" is vague and lacks actionable context (e.g., no timing like ""tonight"" or method like ""pills""). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). The post focuses solely on current emotional state and ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Explicit desire to die (""wanna off myself"") and hatred of life (""I hate my life"") confirm **Ideation**. No indication these thoughts are unwanted.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The vagueness of ""off myself"" lacks imminence or actionable intent, so it does not qualify as Behavior.
   - **Attempt:** Absent; no past or recent suicidal actions described.
   - Strong expressions of despair and suicidal desire without plans/methods fit **Ideation**.

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions being suicidal (""to be suicidal at my age""), expressing hopelessness (""Feeling kinda desperate... hopeless""), and feeling uncared for (""No one in my life cares... miss me"").
   - Explicitly states imminent intent: ""tonight's the night I guess.""
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation details mentioned (e.g., pills, location, note).
   - Describes a past action: contacting a hotline, but this is not a self-initiated suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Directly references being suicidal (""to be suicidal at my age"") and implies imminent action (""tonight's the night"").
   - **Yes**: Expresses desire to end life through context (e.g., ""no one to help me stay alive,"" ""miss me when I'm gone"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No specific method/preparation**: References a timeframe (""tonight"") but no tools, locations, or actions beyond intent.
   - **However**: High imminence (""tonight"") and explicit desire to die (Step 2) coupled with phrases like ""tonight's the night"" imply an *intended action*, even if vague. This aligns with 'Behavior' per rules (vague action + high imminence).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""tonight's the night"").
   - **No past attempt described**: Mentions calling a hotline (seeking help), not a self-initiated suicide action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die + imminent intent (""tonight"") = **Ideation with intent to act**.
   - Lack of specific method/preparation leans toward Ideation, but **high imminence + implied action (""tonight's the night"") pushes it to Behavior** per guidelines.
   - Not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit and not unwanted) or 'Attempt' (no past/initiated action).

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""cutting an artery"" as a method of self-harm/suicide and ""oxy"" (likely oxycodone) as a means to reduce pain during this act. It poses a practical question about the effectiveness of combining these for pain reduction. There is emotional distress indicated by the apology and the statement ""i just don't know who else to ask,"" suggesting isolation and desperation. However, the focus is on the method and its implementation.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""Cutting an artery"" is a direct reference to a potentially lethal action, implying suicide. ""Oxy"" is discussed as a tool to facilitate this action.
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation is present (""don't know who else to ask""), but no explicit hopelessness or burden statements. The primary focus is on the method.
   - Specific plans/methods: Yes, ""cutting an artery"" is a specific method, and ""taking oxy"" is a specific means to reduce pain, indicating planning for the action.
   - Preparations: No explicit signs (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), but the inquiry about pain reduction suggests practical consideration for carrying out the act.
   - References to past actions: None; the post is future-oriented (""wouldn't taking oxy..."").
   - Imminence: Not explicitly stated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), but the immediate inquiry implies current contemplation.
   - Stated desire: No explicit ""I want to die,"" but the method-focused question implies a personal desire to act, as it centers on facilitating a potentially lethal outcome. There is no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""? No.
   - Clear desire to die or for life to end? Not explicitly stated, but strongly implied through the method-focused question (e.g., discussing pain reduction for cutting an artery, which is inherently lethal). Phrases like this, in context, convey an underlying intent.
   - Unwanted thoughts? No explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not desired (e.g., no ""I don't want to act on this""). The question is operational, suggesting consideration of action.
   - Conclusion: Desire to die is implied, so not 'Indicator'. Leans toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific method mentioned? Yes, ""cutting an artery"" is a clear, potentially lethal method. ""Taking oxy"" is a specific means to enable this action by reducing pain.
   - Signs of preparation? No direct evidence, but the question about effectiveness indicates planning and intended action (e.g., exploring how to execute the method).
   - Desire and imminence: Desire is implied, and imminence is not high but the context (asking for practical advice) suggests intent to act. The vagueness of ""wouldn't it lessen the pain"" does not negate the method specificity; in fact, it reinforces consideration of action.
   - Conclusion: Method and intended action are present, so leans strongly toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes past event? No mention of any past initiated action (e.g., no ""I tried this before""). The post is entirely future-focused (""wouldn't taking oxy..."").
   - Past initiated action? None, so no 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because the post involves a personal, current consideration of a suicidal method with implied desire, not general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - 'Ideation' is insufficient because, beyond expressing a desire (implied), there is a specific method (""cutting an artery"") and means (""oxy"") discussed, indicating planning.
   - 'Behavior' fits because the post explicitly mentions a method and intended action (even if in question form), showing practical steps for carrying out a suicidal act. The lack of high imminence or preparation does not override the method specificity.
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no past or initiated action is described.
   - Final decision: The method-focused inquiry, with no negation of intent, places this in 'Behavior'. Doubt between Ideation and Behavior is resolved by the clear method reference.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post primarily discusses the author's distress over a friend's prediction that the author will die by suicide. Key elements include:
     - The friend's statement: ""she's positive I'm going to kill myself,"" and ""she'd put a bet on it happening.""
     - The author's emotional reaction: feeling hurt, betrayed, and viewing the friend differently.
     - References to mental illness (BPD, CPTSD) and efforts to fight it (""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"").
     - **No explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions by the author.** Mentions of suicide are attributed to the friend's words, not the author's own intent.
     - The author questions whether they are overreacting to the friend's comment and seeks advice on handling the conflict.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **No**. The author does not express a personal desire to die, end their life, or engage in self-harm. Phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""commit suicide"" are exclusively used when quoting the friend or discussing the friend's prediction. The author's focus is on the emotional impact of the friend's statement, not on endorsing suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **None mentioned**. There is no indication of the author having a plan, method, or preparation for suicide. The post centers on interpersonal conflict and emotional distress.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions described**. The author references their effort to ""fight"" mental illness but does not describe any self-initiated suicidal behaviors or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses distress, hurt, and hopelessness about the friend's statement and its implications but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**.
   - Mentions of suicide are contextualized as unwanted external projections (the friend's prediction), not the author's own thoughts or feelings. Phrases like ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" further negate personal intent.
   - Strong emotional language (e.g., ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless and hurtful"") relates to the friend's actions, not the author's suicidal ideation.
   - Fits **Indicator**: The post reflects distress about how others perceive the author's mental health struggles, with suicide discussed abstractly (via the friend's comments) but without personal endorsement or desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions being at a window with scissors, feeling like cutting the screen and jumping out, indicating a method (jumping from height) and tools (scissors). Emotional indicators include desperation (""please please please help me""), helplessness (""i dont know what to do""), and distress. Specific plans and preparations are present: being at the window with scissors and stating they are ""about to"" act. Imminence is high (""right now,"" ""about to""). The writer expresses a desire to act but also pleads for help, showing ambivalence, but the suicidal intent is clear from the context.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump out"" strongly implies a lethal, self-directed action in a context of despair. Expressions like ""i feel like im about to"" indicate a current, personal desire to end life. The plea for help suggests distress but does not explicitly negate the desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""cut the screen and jump out""), with tools (scissors) and location (window). Preparations are indicated by being at the scene with means (""im at my window right now with scissors""). High imminence (""right now,"" ""about to"") reinforces this as an intended action. This aligns with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""about to cut the screen and jump out""), not a past event. No initiated action is described (e.g., no reference to a past attempt or action taken). The focus is on imminent behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (implied by ""jump out"" in despair) and a specific method/preparation with high imminence rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/action). 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past or initiated action is described. The high imminence and stated plan confirm 'Behavior'.

   - Expresses emotional distress: ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it.""  
   - States future intention: ""i'm gonna"" implies imminence.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""overdose"" is a direct method of suicide. The phrase ""i'm gonna"" confirms personal intent to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned: ""overdose on iron pills.""  
   - No explicit preparation (e.g., ""I have the pills""), but stating the method + intent (""gonna"") implies a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intention (""gonna""), not a past action. No history of attempt mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die via a specific method (""overdose on iron pills"") + future intent → **Behavior**.  
   - Not *Indicator* (desire is clear and not negated).

   - Not *Attempt* (no past/recent initiated action described).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""im going to kill myself one day.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""i hate it!"" (referencing life), ""i feel like a failure who might as well die,"" ""i just want to disappear,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""
   - Mentions hopelessness (financial entrapment by parents, social rejection, deferred college admission) and worthlessness (""everyone makes fun of me"").
   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, timelines like ""tonight"").
   - No past suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").
   - Stated desire to die is clear and personal, not negated (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it""). The only deterrent is hope for future escape via college, not rejection of suicidal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases (""kill myself"") and clear desire (""want to disappear,"" ""fucking die"").  
   - **No** explicit negation of desire (e.g., thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing intrusions).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **None identified**: Vague references to ""run away to a forest and die"" lack specificity about method (e.g., no implied starvation, exposure, tools). ""Kill myself one day"" implies no imminence or actionable steps.  
   - No mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or rehearsing actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Focuses on **future** intent (""one day"") and current despair.  
   - **No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions** described (e.g., no ""I tried..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die exists; suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent (e.g., ""one day"" is non-specific, no actionable details).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/initiated self-harm.  
   - **Ideation fits**: Strong, explicit expressions of suicidal desire (""kill myself,"" ""want to disappear,"" ""fucking die"") without actionable plans or methods.  
   - Ambiguity note: ""run away to a forest and die"" is metaphorical despair, not a concrete plan (no location/method specified). Deterrent (college hope) doesn’t negate ideation.

74,"Hoping to be murdered. I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die. I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""Hoping to be murdered,"" ""I hate being alive,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life,"" ""I wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""to just end it all,"" ""I want to die""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""losing more hope,"" ""life is so sisyphean,"" ""vicious cycle""), despair (""crying myself to sleep""), feeling like a burden (""useless,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive""), and anhedonia (only feeling ""alright"" when numb). Specific references to suicide methods include ""kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""assisted suicide,"" but these are coupled with an explicit statement that the author lacks the bravery to act personally. The author describes passive behaviors like ""walking through sketchy areas every night"" hoping for murder, but this is not a self-initiated plan or preparation; it's a hope for external intervention. There is no mention of specific tools, locations for self-harm, or preparations (e.g., no suicide note, acquiring means). The timeframe is current and ongoing (""every single day,"" ""every night""), with no reference to past suicidal actions initiated by the author. The stated desire is a genuine wish to die, but the author feels unable to act due to ""cowardice,"" not because the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and similar direct phrases multiple times.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or for life to end, using phrases like ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""end it all,"" which indicate personal suicidal intent. The author does not negate this desire as unwanted; instead, they affirm it but cite an inability to act (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself""). Therefore, this is not a case of explicitly unwanted thoughts (which would lean toward Indicator).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation for self-initiated suicide is mentioned. References to ""murder"" or ""assisted suicide"" involve external agents, not the author's own actions. The behavior of ""walking through sketchy areas"" is a passive hope for external harm, not an active plan or method by the author (e.g., no indication of how the author would personally carry out suicide if brave enough). There is no imminence suggested for self-action (e.g., ""tonight""), only chronic desire. Since there is no plan, method, or preparation for self-harm, this does not meet the threshold for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and ongoing wishes, with no mention of past suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). The only action referenced is the nightly walks, which are not self-initiated suicidal acts but passive behaviors. Therefore, no Attempt is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to die""), meeting the criteria for Ideation. However, there is no plan, method, or preparation for self-initiated suicide—only wishes for external outcomes (murder or assisted suicide). The lack of actionable plan or method rules out Behavior. The desire is not negated as unwanted (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want these thoughts""), so it is not Indicator. With no past initiated actions, Attempt does not apply. Therefore, the best fit is Ideation, as the core content expresses suicidal thoughts without evidence of planning or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions death/dying: ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I'll experience it painfully,"" and ""See you all on the other side.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""I always felt unwanted""), despair (""8,000 fucking days of this shithole""), and exhaustion (""I can't take no more"").
   - Desire to act: ""I think I'm going to leave"" implies intent to end life.
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - Stated desire: Clear wish for life to end (""glad I'm going to die"") without negation of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit phrases: No direct ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong expressions like ""glad I'm going to die"" and ""I'll experience it painfully"" indicate a genuine desire for death. Phrases like ""I'm going to leave"" and ""See you all on the other side"" reinforce intent. No statements rejecting these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die""). → **Yes**, explicit desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. ""I'm going to leave"" and ""See you all on the other side"" imply intent but lack concrete details about *how* or *when*. Vague references like ""experience it painfully"" don’t specify a plan. Imminence is unclear (no ""tonight,"" ""soon""). → **No** plan/method/preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Describes future intent (""I'm going to leave"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). → **No** attempt described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""glad I'm going to die"") and absence of unwanted-thought disclaimers rule out Indicator. Strong hopelessness (""8,000 days of this shithole"") confirms Ideation.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timeline), so not Behavior.
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No mention of past/current initiated actions, so not Attempt.
   - **Final**: Clear desire to die with no plan, method, or action → **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress: hopelessness (""I don't think I can do it anymore""), despair (""tired of only feeling sadness""), self-blame (""blaming myself""), feeling like a burden, and exhaustion from failed coping mechanisms.  
   - Mentions a desire to escape (""I just don't wanna be here"") and metaphorical surrender (""wave the white flag""), but **no explicit references to suicide, death, dying, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**.  
   - No temporal references to past/future actions (e.g., ""tried,"" ""planning"").  
   - Focuses on emotional pain and weariness, not a stated wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. Phrases like ""don't wanna be here"" and ""wave the white flag"" imply distress and escapism but lack explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The author still expresses a desire for happiness (""still want happiness""), weakening suicidal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past or imminent actions described**. References to ""tried every way to cope"" relate to treatments, not suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong indicators of distress (hopelessness, burden) but **no explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent**.  
   - Ambiguous phrases (""don't wanna be here"") lean toward escapism, not active ideation, especially without plan/action.

The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life.

I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: The author states ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and expresses a wish to ""donate my life"" to someone else, implying a desire for their own life to end.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I don't deserve... to live""), self-sacrificial ideation (""donate my life""), and worthlessness (""I don't deserve..."").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: **None mentioned**. The ""donate life"" concept is metaphorical; no concrete tools, locations, or actions are described.  
   - Past actions: References another person's past suicidality but **no mention of the author's own past actions**.  
   - Imminence: No timeframe for acting on feelings (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""I don't want to live,"" showing a personal desire for life to end.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""I don’t want to live"" and ""donate my life"" (in context) express a clear, personal desire to not be alive. The thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. The metaphorical language about ""donating life"" does not imply a specific plan, method, or preparatory step.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current feelings** (wishes, desires). No description of past or imminent self-initiated actions by the author.

Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit expressions of death/suicide: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" and passive death wish via COVID (""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"").
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""healing is a fucking joke,"" ""Family is a fucking joke,"" ""waste of time and energy"").
   - Preparations/actions: Stopping all medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure meds) and quitting therapy. These are intentional acts of self-sabotage that could directly worsen health or mental state.
   - Imminence: Actions are stated as starting ""today.""
   - Desire: Clear personal wish for life to end (""ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" are explicit expressions of a current, personal desire for death. No negation of these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes. Stopping essential medications (including those for mental/physical health) and quitting therapy are **preparatory actions** that actively remove protective factors and could accelerate decline. Hoping for COVID as a passive method (""kill me faster"") implies consideration of means. These acts show intentional steps toward enabling death, even if not a traditional ""plan.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""I'm stopping... today,"" ""I'm quitting""). No mention of past suicide attempts or initiated lethal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation threshold met) + **preparatory actions** (discontinuing meds/therapy) = **Behavior**.  
   - Medication cessation is a concrete, harmful preparation tied to the desire to die. Hoping for COVID reinforces intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense emotional distress (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""free from all this pain"") and a desire to escape (""disappear""). 
    - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. 
    - Key phrases: ""want to disappear"" (metaphorical escape) and ""free from pain"" (desire for relief). 
    - No references to past actions, plans, methods, or imminence. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself."" 
    - ""Want to disappear"" suggests escapism but lacks a clear, literal expression of a desire to die (e.g., not equivalent to ""I want to be dead""). 
    - The primary sentiment is distress about pain, not a stated wish for death. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **No** mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - **No** description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses hopelessness and a plea for relief from suffering but **lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions**. 
    - Phrases like ""want to disappear"" are ambiguous but lean toward metaphorical distress rather than literal ideation. Without stronger indicators (e.g., ""I want to die""), this fits **Indicator**. 
    - Contrast with Ideation: Expressions like ""I hate living"" would imply a desire to end life, but ""disappear"" here is vaguer and contextually focused on escaping pain. 
    - No evidence of unwanted suicidal thoughts, but the absence of explicit suicidal intent places it in Indicator.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" indicating direct personal involvement. The emotional tone is distressed, with the author questioning reasons not to commit suicide and expressing a need for a suicide plan.
   - There are no specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) described. The phrase ""I just need a plan for suicide"" suggests contemplation but not an existing or detailed plan.
   - Imminence is not indicated; the ""Goodnight"" implies no immediate action.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").
   - No past suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" showing clear personal suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" expresses a desire to die or for life to end, reinforced by the PS about needing a suicide plan.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the author is actively considering action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The statement ""I just need a plan"" indicates the author is thinking about formulating a plan but has not described one, making it vague and not actionable.
   - Without a specific plan or method, and with no high imminence (e.g., ""tonight""), this does not meet the threshold for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (e.g., needing a plan), not past events. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and lack of unwanted thoughts disqualify this from Indicator.
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is present, despite the mention of needing a plan, so it does not qualify as Behavior.
   - No past or recent initiated actions are described, so Attempt does not apply.
   - The core content involves explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, with contemplation of planning but no concrete elements, fitting Ideation best. The vagueness of ""need a plan"" without details or imminence leans toward Ideation over Behavior.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes mentions of suicide (""I'm going to kill myself""), self-harm (""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly""), and a specific past action (""my most recent failed attempt"" relating to ""I wish I stayed in the car""). It also describes a current behavior of simulating suicide (""putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out""). Emotional indicators include distress about uncontrollable thoughts/utterances and seeking relatability (""am I crazy or can anyone else relate?""). The context suggests these expressions are involuntary and unwanted, as the user compares them to Tourettes but acknowledges they are not.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide: Yes, ""I'm going to kill myself"" is directly quoted.
   - Clear desire to die: The phrases are framed as uncontrollable utterances, not necessarily reflecting a current personal desire. The user expresses distress about these thoughts, implying they are unwanted (e.g., ""almost uncontrollably,"" seeking validation if others relate). However, phrases like ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" could imply intent, but the overall context leans toward distress about the thoughts rather than a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Method mentioned: The finger gun simulation (""pretending to blow my brains out"") references a specific method (firearm), but it is described as a compulsive behavior, not an active plan. ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"" is vague and not tied to a concrete plan or preparation. No evidence of imminent action (e.g., timing, acquiring means).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past event: The user explicitly references ""my most recent failed attempt"" in relation to ""I wish I stayed in the car,"" indicating a self-initiated, potentially lethal action that was carried out but failed. This is a clear description of a past suicide attempt by the author, mentioned in the context of current feelings and behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains current suicidal ideation (e.g., utterances about killing oneself) and behavior-like elements (finger gun simulation), but the clear description of a past suicide attempt takes precedence per the rules. 'Attempt' is defined as including historical attempts if brought up by the author in the current context, which applies here. The involuntary nature of the current thoughts/behaviors does not override the precedence of the described past attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category.

I haven't made a single friend, let alone done anything fun. At this point it just feels like I'm just going through the motions. Is this my life now? Spending day after day at home by myself, nobody to talk to, nothing to do other than work. If that's what my life is going to be I don't want it. I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The author expresses intense hopelessness (""endless torment,"" ""going through the motions,"" ""seemingly endless torment""), isolation (friends ignoring them, no college social life), and despair about the future (""Is this my life now?"").  
   - Explicit suicide mention: ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness, worthlessness (""nobody to talk to""), and anhedonia (""nothing to do other than work"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: **None mentioned** (no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).  
   - Imminence: ""now"" and ""endure another day"" suggest immediacy.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""kill myself now"") with **no negation** (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a clear desire to die (""I don’t want [this life]"").  
   - Thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted/distressing; they reflect a genuine desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No method or plan**: ""Kill myself"" is a general intent without specifics (e.g., no pills, weapons, or locations).  
   - **No preparation**: No mention of acquiring means or final acts.  
   - Despite high imminence (""now""), the absence of any actionable detail keeps this in Ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future** intentions (""kill myself now"").  
   - **No past actions**: No references to prior attempts or self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") rules this out.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan, method, or preparation mentioned. High imminence alone is insufficient without actionable details.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past or recent self-initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation**: Clear desire to die (""kill myself"") with no plan/method. Phrases like ""I don’t want [this life]"" and ""endless torment"" reinforce suicidal intent without crossing into planning or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"" (method: gun).  
   - Emotional indicators: Fear, attachment to cats/friends, daily urges, feeling unable to act (""too much of a pussy""), intrusive thoughts about dying.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specific method (gun) mentioned, but **no indication of preparation** (e.g., owning a gun, setting a date) or imminent action. Explicitly states inability to act (""can never bring myself to actually do it"").  
   - Past actions: None described.  
   - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself""), but conflicted due to fear/attachments. **Desire is not negated as unwanted**; instead, inability to act is emphasized.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out.""  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""want to kill myself,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out"").  
   - **No**: Suicidal thoughts are **not explicitly stated as unwanted**. The author expresses conflict (fear/attachments) but **does not disavow the desire itself**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method mentioned: Gun (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").  
   - **No preparation** described (e.g., accessing a gun, writing a note).  
   - **No imminence**: Urges are daily but countered by explicit inability to act.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past actions**: Focus is on current thoughts/urges with no reference to prior attempts.  
   - **No initiated action**: Author explicitly states they cannot act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die is present and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Not 'Behavior'**: Specific method (gun) is mentioned, but **no plan, preparation, or imminent action** exists. Inability to act negates intent for immediate behavior.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of past or recent initiated actions.  
   - **Ideation**: Strong expressions of desire to die (""want to kill myself""), specific suicidal thoughts (""urge to blow my brains out""), and emotional distress, **lacking actionable plans or preparations**. Conflict/inaction aligns with passive ideation.

86,"kill me. i'll dm the address, please come here and murder me i beg of you end my horrible life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains direct phrases like ""kill me,"" ""murder me,"" and ""end my horrible life,"" indicating a strong desire for death. Emotional indicators include ""my horrible life,"" suggesting despair and hopelessness. There is a specific method/plan mentioned: ""i'll dm the address,"" which implies preparation to facilitate death by having someone else kill the author. The language (""please come here,"" ""i beg of you"") shows high imminence and urgency. The author expresses a genuine, personal wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and ""murder me,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to die. Phrases like ""end my horrible life"" confirm a clear, current wish for life to end. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don't want to die""), so the desire is explicit and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: death by murder (having someone else kill the author). Preparation is indicated by ""i'll dm the address,"" which involves taking concrete steps (sharing location) to enable the act. This, combined with high imminence from the pleading tone, constitutes intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""please come here,"" ""i'll dm""), not a past event. There is no mention of any initiated action by the author (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""), so it does not qualify as a past behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit desire to die (Ideation-level), but it goes further by including a method (murder) and preparation (DMing address). This elevates it to Behavior. The risk is focused on the author's own actions (offering address for murder), and there is no ambiguity—intent and plan are clear. Attempt is not applicable, as no past action is described.

87,"I'm about to get fired, my boss hates me, and I deserve it. I'm 21, and I graduated college in December. My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before. I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time. I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen. But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness (""I don't see a way out""), and feelings of being trapped.  
   - Mentions death passively: ""I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time.""  
   - Explicitly negates active suicidal intent: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""  
   - Expresses passive ideation: ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" (implying relief through cessation of struggle, not active self-harm).  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, self-harm, or phrases like ""kill myself.""  
   - Passive expressions (e.g., ""things would be better if I didn't have to try"") **lack genuine desire to die**; instead, they reflect hopelessness.  
   - **Desire is explicitly negated**: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"" rules out active intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No references** to plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations, or imminent actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Distress and passive thoughts about death are present, but **active desire to die is negated** and **no plan/action exists**.  
   - Phrases like ""things would be better if I didn't have to try"" reflect exhaustion/hopelessness, not suicidal ideation, especially given the explicit disclaimer against self-harm.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Unwanted passive thoughts without personal intent, plan, or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" explicitly.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""i can't keep getting false hope that i'll actually end up happy""), despair (""crushed and empty""), and emotional pain (""this is too hard"").  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline for suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent actions like ""tonight"").  
   - No reference to past suicide attempts or initiated actions.  
   - Describes suicidal thoughts as persistent but includes a struggle against them (""maybe i can power through"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and links them to personal distress.  
   - **No clear desire to act**: While thoughts are intensifying, the phrase ""help me please"" and hope to ""power through"" imply distress about the thoughts, not an active wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans, preparations, or imminent actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past actions**: Focuses on current thoughts and feelings; no description of past suicide attempts or initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""suicidal thoughts get stronger"") and hopelessness (""i can't keep getting false hope"") indicate **Ideation**. Though the writer seeks help, they do *not* explicitly state the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts""). Phrases like ""i thought that maybe i can power through"" suggest internal conflict but fall short of negating the desire to die.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **Attempt**: No past/current initiated lethal actions described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: Explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and isolation (""Everyone is asleep... Everyone who could help me is asleep""), a sense of burden (""This is my problem, my illness, it's on me""), and a farewell message (""Rest In Peace ya'll"").
   - Specific plan and imminence: ""planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates a clear intention with high imminence (""tonight"").
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, means) is detailed, but ""planning to kill myself"" implies an intended action.
   - No references to past actions; the focus is on future intent.
   - Stated desire: A genuine wish to die is expressed through ""planning to kill myself,"" with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""planning to kill myself tonight"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the author is actively planning action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method or tools are mentioned, but ""planning to kill myself"" coupled with high imminence (""tonight"") implies an intended action. The thinking process notes that even a vague reference to action, when paired with strong intent and imminence, leans toward 'Behavior'.
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are described, but the phrase ""planning to"" suggests an active intention to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no mention of past actions. Therefore, it does not describe an initiated, potentially lethal action from the past.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear, personal desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - 'Ideation' is not sufficient because, although there is explicit suicidal desire, the mention of ""planning to kill myself tonight"" indicates an intended action with high imminence, moving it beyond mere thoughts.
   - 'Behavior' fits best: The post expresses suicidal thoughts/desire (""kill myself"") and includes an intended action (""planning to"") with imminence (""tonight""), even if the method is vague.
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no past or initiated action is described.
   - Despite the lack of method details, the high imminence and explicit planning intent support 'Behavior' over 'Ideation' (per the rule: lean toward 'Behavior' if imminence and intent are high).

   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and frames it as a solution (""suicide is the only thing..."").

   - Imminence: ""Soon"" implies near-future intent, reinforced by ongoing practice.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""can't wait,"" ""will succeed,"" death as happiness). No negation of desire.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and active preparation negate this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""I want to die,"" ""I want to disappear,"" ""I will take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone.""

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains explicit mentions of death and suicide (e.g., ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""taking my life,"" ""suicidal,"" ""I want to take my life,"" ""attempted suicide""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair (e.g., ""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness,"" feeling ""useless""). Specific preparations are mentioned (drafting a suicide note), and a past action is described (""I attempted suicide last week""). The timeframe for the attempt is ""last week,"" and it is linked to current feelings. The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""taking my life,"" and ""I want to take my life."" It expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""the thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me""). There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is detailed for the past attempt, preparations are mentioned (drafting a note). For current thoughts, there is no explicit plan, method, or imminent action described; the focus is on the aftermath of the past attempt and ongoing ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""I attempted suicide last week."" This is a concrete event initiated by the author, with details provided (e.g., not leaving a finalized note, the attempt failing). The timeframe (""last week"") is recent, and it is directly tied to the author's current state (e.g., ""back to this never-ending cycle""). This qualifies as an 'Attempt' regardless of the historical nature, as per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The clear description of a past suicidal action (""I attempted suicide last week"") takes precedence. Even with current expressions of ideation (e.g., ""I want to take my life""), the rules specify that 'Attempt' applies when a past initiated action is described by the author in the context of their current state. There is no current plan or method mentioned that would elevate it to 'Behavior', and the explicit desire rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of the past attempt categorizes this as 'Attempt'.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes a direct question about the lethal dose of Valium (""How much valium does it take to kill you?""), which is a specific method for suicide.
   - It expresses emotional distress with phrases like ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" and ""I just want this nightmare to end,"" indicating hopelessness and a desire to escape suffering.
   - There is an implication of action taken: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" suggests the author has already ingested Valium with suicidal intent.
   - Imminence is high, as the language (""I'm afraid,"" ""I just want"") indicates current, ongoing feelings and actions.
   - The stated desire (""I just want this nightmare to end"") is not negated; it reflects a genuine wish for life to end to relieve pain.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions killing (""kill you""), which in context is self-referential, and expresses a clear desire to die through ""I just want this nightmare to end."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (Valium overdose) is mentioned. The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates preparation and initiation of the method, as it implies the author has already consumed Valium with lethal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a very recent or ongoing self-initiated action: ingesting Valium (""I haven't taken enough"") with the intent to die. This constitutes a potentially lethal action that has been initiated, fitting the definition of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of a described, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (taking Valium) takes precedence, aligning with the 'Attempt' category. Even if the outcome is uncertain, the action is clearly stated. Current distress and intent support this, but the initiated action is the key factor. This overrides 'Behavior' (which would apply if planning or preparation were mentioned without action) or 'Ideation' (which lacks action). There is no ambiguity about unwanted thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit expressions: ""I don't want to live at all,"" references to ""suicide attempts"" (plural), and detailed descriptions of past actions.
   - Specific methods/preparations: Swallowing bottles of sleeping pills (with suicide note), slicing neck with a razor, overdosing on prescriptions.
   - Temporal context: Describes 3 distinct past self-initiated suicidal actions (ages 16 and 2020).
   - Current desire: Opens with ""I don't want to live at all,"" linking past attempts to present hopelessness.
   - No explicit negation of current desire to die; the motorcycle incident is unrelated to suicide but reinforces feelings of futility.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""I don't want to live at all"" expresses a current desire for life to end.
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Not applicable for *current* behavior, as methods/preparations described are historical. The focus shifts to past actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The author details **3 specific past suicidal actions**:
     - Age 16: Intentional overdose on sleeping pills (with note and hospitalization).
     - November 2020: Self-harm with a razor targeting the neck.
     - November 2020: Intentional overdose on prescription cocktails.
   - All were potentially lethal, self-initiated, and resulted in survival. The author explicitly labels them as ""suicide attempts.""

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Current expressions (""I don't want to live at all"") indicate active **Ideation**.
   - However, **'Attempt' takes precedence** because:
     - The post centrally describes **multiple past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions** by the author.
     - These are explicitly framed as ""suicide attempts"" and are discussed in the context of the author's ongoing struggle.
     - Historical attempts qualify as 'Attempt' per the rules when mentioned by the author in relation to current state.
   - No *current* plan/method/preparation is described, ruling out 'Behavior'. Strong current desire for death is present, but the documented past actions override this for classification.

Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly and asks for reasons not to.  
   - Expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""I'm ready to be done""), despair over failing health (liver pain from alcoholism), divorce (losing family/home), and business collapse.  
   - **Specific method/preparation described**: ""I put a belt around my neck, and sat down against the doorknob in the closet tonight.""  
   - **Action initiated**: He describes a physical act (applying pressure with the belt) that he stopped ""right before [he] passed out.""  
   - **Imminence**: States he is ""so close to just doing it"" and needs ""someone to push me one more inch,"" indicating high current intent.  
   - **Temporal context**: The belt incident occurred ""tonight"" (very recent past), and current ideation is strongly expressed.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""just doing it.""  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to""). Strong personal wish to die is evident. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Belt around the neck, using a doorknob for leverage.  
   - Preparation/action: Physically placed the belt and initiated pressure until near-loss of consciousness. → **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: He performed the belt act ""tonight,"" stopping only moments before passing out. This is an initiated suicidal action (interrupted by himself).  
   - Timeframe (""tonight"") confirms recency.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** criteria are met: The author describes a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (belt strangulation) that he physically carried out but interrupted. This qualifies as an **Attempt** regardless of recency (as per rules: past actions count if described by the author).  
   - Current expressions of intent (""so close to just doing it"") reinforce risk but do not override the **Attempt** classification, as the past action is explicitly detailed.  
   - Contrast with Behavior: While current high-risk ideation exists, the **Attempt** category takes precedence because a past initiated lethal action is unambiguously stated.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include ""too tired of life,"" expressing hopelessness and despair. There is no mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or locations for suicide. The user states being ""too scared to kill myself,"" highlighting fear as a barrier to action, and references legal consequences (""suicide is illegal here"") as a deterrent. No past actions or attempts are described, and there is no indication of imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The stated desire shows a conflict: a wish for life to end due to exhaustion but an unwillingness to act due to fear and legal concerns.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" which are direct phrases indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire for life to end through ""too tired of life,"" which implies a personal wish to not be alive, despite the fear barrier. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don't want to die""); instead, the barrier is external (fear and legal issues). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or plan is mentioned or implied. The reference to ""suicide is illegal here"" and fear of failure is a general deterrent, not a description of a method or preparation.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means, or goodbyes).
   - Despite the explicit desire to die, there is no indication of an intended action, method, or plan, even vaguely. The phrase ""too scared to kill myself"" explicitly negates current action, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts but no past or recent actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (""too tired of life"") and explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""), placing it beyond 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
   - There is no plan, method, preparation, or intended action described, ruling out 'Behavior'. The fear and legal concerns indicate a lack of current intent to act, but the core suicidal ideation remains.
   - No past or recent initiated actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The presence of suicidal thoughts with a desire for life to end, but without any behavioral elements, aligns with 'Ideation'. The ambiguity between desire and fear is resolved by the explicit expression of suicidal intent, which is not negated as unwanted (only feared).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and despair (""fuck this fucking world,"" ""miserable lives,"" ""rotting away,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose"").  
   - Critically, it includes: ""This will be my second to last post. I’m taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good."" The phrase ""end this bullshit for good"" implies ending life/suicide. The trip in April indicates a **specific timeframe and preparation** for this action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""end this bullshit for good"" strongly conveys a **personal desire for life to end** in the context of despair. No negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to"") is present. → **Yes**, implicit but clear desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - A **specific plan** is indicated: ""taking a trip in April to end this."" The trip serves as preparation/location for the intended action. Though no method (e.g., pills, gun) is named, the combination of intent (""end this""), timeframe (""April""), and preparation (""trip"") qualifies as a **planned action**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""taking a trip in April"") with no mention of past actions. → Not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is present** (Ideation threshold met).  
   - **Plan/preparation is evident** (trip in April to ""end this""), pushing it to **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action → Not Attempt.  
   - No ambiguity: Intent and plan are coupled, ruling out Indicator/Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The user expresses a wish to ""get hit by a car or od on meds or anything.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""no body cares,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""no one left to turn to""), anhedonia (""no motivation to even get up""), and isolation (""spend most of my time in my room"").  
   - Specific methods/plans: References overdosing (""od on meds"") and passive methods (e.g., ""get hit by a car""), but no explicit plan, preparation, or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly states a *wish* for death (""i just wish i could..."") without negating the desire.  
   - No references to past actions or preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the statement ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" expresses a **clear desire to die** (e.g., passively wishing for death). The thoughts are **not framed as unwanted** (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are mentioned (""od on meds,"" ""get hit by a car""), but only as hypothetical wishes (""i wish""). No evidence of planning, acquiring means, preparing, or imminent intent (e.g., ""I will do this tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings and wishes, **no past or recent self-initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to OD yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** (""wish i could...""), placing this beyond 'Indicator'.  
   - **No plan/preparation/intended action**—methods are vague hypotheticals, not actionable plans. This rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No description of past initiated actions**, ruling out 'Attempt'.

I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and despair about the author's physical appearance (""ugly person's body,"" ""daily torture,"" ""unwanted in all facets of life""). 
   - There are strong emotional indicators of distress (e.g., ""daily torture,"" ""unwanted"") and a belief that appearance determines life outcomes. 
   - The author states, ""I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way,"" indicating a profound dissatisfaction with life but **no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions**. 
   - Phrases like ""jump out of bed every morning"" are metaphorical (referring to enthusiasm if attractive) and not literal. 
   - No temporal references to past/current actions or future intentions related to self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No**. The post lacks direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent expressions. Despair is centered on life circumstances (appearance), not a desire for life to end. Hyperbolic statements (e.g., ""give everything"") reflect desperation for change, not a wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**. No references to suicide plans, methods, tools, locations, preparations, or intended actions. Anger is directed outward (at attractive people), not inward toward self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No**. The post describes ongoing emotional suffering but **no mention of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt**. 
   - While phrases like ""daily torture"" imply deep anguish, they do not meet the threshold for *Ideation* (which requires explicit desire to die). 
   - Without suicidal intent, plan, or action, this fits **Indicator** (general distress without personal suicidal ideation/behavior).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""me being suicidal"" and explicitly states past actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" It also includes emotional indicators like frustration (""tired of people's ignorance"") and context of abuse and severe mental illness. There is no mention of current plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, they are presented as a genuine experience being dismissed by others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die in the past and implied current suicidal thoughts. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), so it does not fit 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The post focuses on past attempts (""tried to kill myself"") without detailing methods or imminent actions. This rules out 'Behavior' for the current state.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past self-initiated actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" This is a clear reference to specific, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author, regardless of timeframe. Even though the attempts are historical, they are mentioned in the context of current feelings (frustration with dismissal), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit description of past suicide attempts (""tried to kill myself 8 times"") takes precedence over any current ideation (e.g., ""me being suicidal""). This fits the 'Attempt' category, as it involves initiated actions that were potentially lethal. There is no ambiguity: the post does not describe current plans or methods (so not 'Behavior'), and the suicidal thoughts are not explicitly unwanted (so not 'Indicator'). 'Attempt' applies here, as per the rule that it includes historical attempts when mentioned by the author in relation to their current state.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses frustration with perceived hypocrisy in how people respond to different types of removal (removing negative influences vs. suicidal thoughts). 
   - Key phrase: ""i'm better off dead"" is mentioned as something the author says to others. 
   - Emotional indicators: Sarcasm/resentment ("":D"" emoji, contrast in reactions), but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden statements. 
   - No mentions of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The phrase ""better off dead"" implies a passive wish for non-existence but is framed as a rhetorical point about societal double standards, not a direct personal declaration like ""I want to die."" 
   - The author does not explicitly state a *current* desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts. The tone is ironic/observational (""when I say... everyone's like""). 
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit personal suicidal intent; the statement is used to highlight inconsistency in others' advice. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - None present. No references to tools, locations, timelines, or actions. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Refers to a recurring statement (""when I say"") but describes no past, current, or future self-initiated actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - ""Better off dead"" could be misconstrued as ideation, but the context shows it is used to critique others' reactions, not express a genuine personal desire to die. The sarcastic tone and lack of ownership (""when I say"") align with **Indicator** (general distress about societal hypocrisy). 
   - No plan/action supports Indicator over Ideation/Behavior. No past attempt described. 
   - **Final**: 'Indicator'—expresses distress and references suicidal ideation abstractly but lacks personal, current desire to die.

104,overdose help please. sorry if this is the wrong subreddit or an inappropriate post but i dont know where else to post/ask this. i took 44 paracetamol almost an ho ur ago and i dont think i want to die but something is stopping me cllng 999. my stomach is hurting very badly. i didnt eat most of today if that cha ges anything. sweating badly and shakingtoo. could i survive an od like this or do i need to call emergency services? i feel like a burden. i did this to myself after all,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions taking a specific method/means: ""took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" (lethal dose). 
   - Describes physical symptoms consistent with overdose: stomach pain, sweating, shaking. 
   - Expresses ambivalence (""i dont think i want to die"") but acknowledges self-initiated action (""i did this to myself""). 
   - Emotional indicators: feeling like a burden, distress about hesitating to call emergency services. 
   - Timeframe: Action occurred recently (""almost an hour ago"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - Expresses doubt about wanting to die (""i dont think i want to die""). 
   - Ambivalence leans away from explicit current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Specific method (44 paracetamol) and action taken (""took""). 
   - Physical symptoms confirm ingestion occurred. 
   - No future plan mentioned; focus is on consequences of past action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a **past self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""took 44 paracetamol""). 
   - Action was recent (within the hour) and resulted in acute physical distress. 
   - This qualifies as a suicide attempt, regardless of stated ambivalence post-action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is a description of a **past self-initiated, potentially lethal act** (overdose). 
   - Physical symptoms confirm the action was carried out. 
   - Current distress or ambivalence doesn't negate the completed action. 
   - Rules state: **'Attempt' takes precedence** if a past initiated action is described by the author. 
   - Fits 'Attempt' definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... potentially lethal.""

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements are the repeated phrase ""I want to end it,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide or ending one's life. There are no specific mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances). Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as seen in the strong desire expressed. However, the post explicitly states there is ""no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plan, method, or preparation. There are no references to past actions or imminence (e.g., no timeframe like ""tonight""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to end their life but clarifies uncertainty about execution.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" strongly implies a desire for death in context (e.g., similar to ""I want to die"" or ""life isn't worth it""). There is a clear personal desire to die (""I want to end it""), with no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to act on it""). This leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. The writer explicitly denies having any plan or means (""no idea how, when or anything else""). There is no indication of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring items). Despite the strong desire, the lack of any reference to action, even vague, means this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. Imminence is absent due to the uncertainty expressed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current/future intention but no past or recent actions. There is no mention of initiated events (e.g., ""I tried to...""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to end it"") without explicit negation of suicidal thoughts. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no plan, method, or preparation, as confirmed by the writer's denial of knowing ""how, when or anything else."" It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent self-initiated action is described. The presence of explicit suicidal desire without actionable elements fits 'Ideation'. The phrase ""I want to end it"" is interpreted as suicidal ideation, and the lack of method/plan confirms this category.

106,"Well looks like I'm back. It's been a year since I last posted here and I'm in the exact same situation. I'm sick and tired of this vicious cycle of highs and lows. I really can't handle it anymore. I don't know what to do with myself. I feel like a robot at this point, its so weird cus its like I feel nothing and like I'm overloading at the same time. I just want someone to care about me or to listen to how I actually feel for once instead of relying on me for stability when I'm not fucking stable myself. I'm exhausted. I don't know why I can't just enjoy my life, I really don't. I should enjoy it yet my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it. I don't think anyone even realises how bad I am again, like when I tell someone I need them it just flies over their head. I'm really trying but it feels completely hopeless bc I know I should be fine. but I'm just not.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of exhaustion, hopelessness, and emotional overload (e.g., ""sick and tired,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""feel like a robot,"" ""exhausted,"" ""hopeless""). There is a strong sense of distress and a desire for support (e.g., ""I just want someone to care about me""). However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No references to past actions, plans, preparations, or imminence of suicidal intent are present. The writer discusses their mental state and frustration with life but does not express a personal wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar are used. The post does not express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent). Instead, the focus is on distress and a longing for connection (e.g., ""I just want someone to care about me""). Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, there is no indication of unwanted thoughts or a negated desire. This absence of suicidal intent leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. There are no signs of planning, intended action, or imminence (e.g., no references to ""tonight"" or ""soon"" in a suicidal context). Without any suicidal desire from Step 2, this step is not applicable, but even if considered, there are no behavioral elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post references a one-year gap since last posting and describes current emotional struggles, but there is no description of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The context is about ongoing feelings, not actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The content falls under 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and emotional turmoil without any explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""it feels completely hopeless"" indicate despair but are not equivalent to expressions of wanting life to end (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be 'Ideation'). There is no ambiguity here—suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and the primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances and a need for support. No elements of 'Ideation' (desire to die), 'Behavior' (plan/method), or 'Attempt' (past action) are present.

107,"just found out i'm bipolar. i just found out i'm bipolar. That's great. i mean it does explain A FUCK TON in my life but it was hard to accept it at first. i'm in therapy again btw so it might get better for me. I have really bad bipolar tendencies tho so i'm a lot like my old abusive uncle except i could never hurt anyone physically, im very good at manipulation and it scares me sometimes bc ion wan be that person. other than feeling lonely and lost as ever and not knowing what to do wit my life i've been overall better compared to the rest of my life. i feel more like myself. starting to accept who i am wether i like who it is or not. i hope everyone is okay, if you aren't there's always a way to improve on something even if your at rock bottom. everyone has to hit that rock bottom to get better too, once you hit bottom there's nothing lower but death. my rock bottom was having really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns and almost being abusive and puking everyday for nearly 2 years. these last 2 years since i've been way better tho, weird to think so much has happened in 4 years but also so little. luv y'all please find a way to stay positive and stay safe. even if no one sees my posts this community will forever be the safest place bc i can vent and leave and if i regret a post delete it the next day",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions past mental health struggles (depression/bipolar breakdowns, ""puking everyday for nearly 2 years""), but no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, death, or dying.
   - Emotional indicators include loneliness, feeling lost, and past distress, but the tone is primarily reflective and hopeful (e.g., ""i've been overall better,"" ""starting to accept who I am,"" ""luv y'all please find a way to stay positive"").
   - Uses the phrase ""nothing lower but death"" in a general motivational context about hitting rock bottom, not as a personal expression of intent.
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions. The closest reference (""almost being abusive"") relates to interpersonal behavior, not self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""
   - No expressions of personal desire to die (e.g., ""I hate living"" is absent). The mention of ""death"" is abstract and impersonal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - None present. No tools, locations, or preparations described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes past mental health struggles (breakdowns, depression) but no initiated self-harm or suicide attempts (e.g., ""almost being abusive"" refers to behavior toward others, not self-directed violence).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Expresses distress (loneliness, past turmoil) but lacks personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions.
   - The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a generalized observation, not a statement of intent. The overall tone emphasizes improvement and encouragement.
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress is present, but suicidal ideation/behavior is absent. The author explicitly focuses on recovery and positivity.

108,"plan on ending it soon. i dont know what else to do and i am overwhelmed by guilt just from the thought, i wish i could apologize a million times to my girlfriend and family but they would just be pissed off at me. i dont know if overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work but thats likely my go-to plan. i dont know when, tonight or this week, or even anytime soon. pain scares me too much.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""plan on ending it soon,"" which implies suicide. It includes emotional indicators like feeling overwhelmed by guilt, fear of pain, and hopelessness about relationships. A specific method (""overdosing on ibuprofen"") is identified as the ""go-to plan."" There is uncertainty about timing (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon""), but no mention of past actions or preparations. The author expresses a desire to die but with hesitation due to fear of pain.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""ending it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, indicating explicit suicidal intent. The author states a personal desire to die (e.g., ""plan on ending it soon""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, the author is conflicted due to fear, not a lack of desire. Thus, this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""overdosing on ibuprofen,"" and it is referred to as the ""go-to plan."" This constitutes a clear plan/method, even though the timing is uncertain and the author expresses fear. The presence of a method, coupled with suicidal intent, supports 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"") with no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of a previous attempt). Therefore, this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (from step 2) and the mention of a specific method (from step 3) rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). The absence of any past initiated action rules out 'Attempt'. The uncertainty about timing does not negate the presence of a plan/method, so 'Behavior' is the best fit.

109,I Relapsed After Almost Two Years. I don't want to get into details but I think I have an addiction to extreme pornography and have had it since I was a kid. Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicidal intent: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""feel like shit""), hopelessness (""born/meant to be fucked up""), anticipation of worsening distress (""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"").
   - Method specified: Gun (""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"").
   - No preparation described (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note).
   - No past suicidal actions described (relapse refers to addiction, not suicide).
   - Imminence: Not specified (conditional on having a gun, no timeframe like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Explicitly states ""I'd kill myself"" as a personal desire conditional on access to means.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Method mentioned: Gun. However, it is hypothetical (""If I had..."") with no indication of access, plan formulation, or preparation. The conditional framing negates actionable intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions described. Relapse refers to addiction, not suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die is present (Ideation), but no actionable plan/preparation exists (method is conditional/unavailable). Strong suicidal ideation (""I'd kill myself"") with a method mention does not become Behavior without evidence of intent/readiness to act. Absence of preparation or imminent timeframe supports Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and includes a direct statement of desire: ""i just wanna kill myself."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., feeling trapped by parents' smoking, fear of lung cancer for self and brother, and inability to avoid the situation). 
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), or intended action. The phrase ""i just wanna kill myself"" expresses a wish but lacks details on how or when. 
   - No past suicidal actions or attempts are described (e.g., no references to ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). 
   - Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the desire is framed as a response to future fears (""before i have to see him or myself get it""). 
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die to escape suffering, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on them"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent. 
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""i just wanna kill myself"" to avoid future pain). 
   - No, the writer does not state that the thoughts are unwanted; instead, the desire is presented as personal and genuine. This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned or implied. 
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present. 
   - Despite high distress, the reference to ""kill myself"" is vague and not coupled with any actionable plan or imminence (e.g., no ""I have a plan to..."" or ""I will do it tonight""). Thus, it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and future-oriented fears but no past or recent initiated actions. There is no mention of a specific past attempt (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted...""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""i just wanna kill myself"") and lack of unwanted-thought qualifiers rule out 'Indicator'. 
   - The absence of any plan, method, preparation, or intended action means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. 
   - No description of a past self-initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die but without indications of planning, method, or imminent action.

I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""how I can kill myself"" indicates direct suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include ""worthless existence,"" ""past years have been shit,"" and hopelessness.
   - Specific plan is mentioned (""I've finally got a plan""), with a timeframe (""next week""). Preparations include farewell to Reddit (""Goodbye reddit"").
   - Imminence is indicated (""next week"").
   - Desire is explicit: ""excited to finally move on"" shows a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide plan"" are direct. Desire to die is clear (""move on from this worthless existence"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states ""I've got a suicide plan"" and confirms planning (""thinking it over""). Though no method is detailed, the existence of a concrete plan with high imminence (""next week"") qualifies as intended action. Preparations include farewells.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a future intention (""plan on doing it next week""), not a past action. No mention of initiated behavior (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit desire to die is present. The confirmed plan and imminent timeframe elevate this to 'Behavior' (planned action). 
   - **Attempt**: Not applicable, as no past/initiated action is described.
   - **Indicator**: Does not apply, as suicidal desire is personal and explicit.

**Conclusion**: The post meets 'Behavior' criteria due to explicit suicidal intent coupled with a stated plan, preparations (farewell), and imminent timeframe.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" recurring and a past suicide attempt (""attempted suicide in the past many years ago""). 
   - Expresses hopelessness (e.g., ""this year has pushed me back down,"" chronic pain causing helplessness) and guilt about seeking help. 
   - No current plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent described. Focus is on distress, seeking support, and historical context. 
   - Actively taking steps to get help (setting appointments, confiding in wife/friend). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicitly mentions past suicidal thoughts and a past attempt, but **no current explicit desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts**. 
   - Recurring thoughts are framed as a struggle (""pushed me back down""), not a current wish to die. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No current plan, method, or preparation** mentioned. References to suicide are historical (past attempt) or generalized (recurring thoughts). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Clearly describes a **past self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""attempted suicide in the past""). 
   - This is linked to current struggles (thoughts returning), meeting the 'Attempt' criterion for historical actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past suicide attempt takes precedence under the 'Attempt' definition, regardless of timeframe, as it is explicitly described by the author in the context of current distress. 
   - Current expressions lack explicit desire to die, plans, or imminent action, ruling out Ideation/Behavior. Distress about recurring thoughts is secondary to the disclosed past attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: feeling detached (""don't feel like a person""), isolation, fear of abandonment, suffering in silence, and depression.  
   - Explicitly references ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) as a coping mechanism but states inability to act due to fear of discovery (""can't even cut because my bf will see"").  
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or methods related to suicide.  
   - No expressions of desire to die, end life, or suicidal intent.  
   - No plans, preparations, or timelines for suicidal actions.  
   - Focus is on emotional overwhelm and suppression of coping mechanisms (self-harm), not suicidal behavior.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or desire to die.  
   - Phrases like ""I'm suffering"" and ""it's getting to be too much"" convey distress but **not a wish for death**.  
   - ""Thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) is acknowledged but framed as a blocked coping mechanism, **not an expression of suicidal desire**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No reference** to suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations.  
   - Self-harm (""cut"") is mentioned in the context of coping, not as a suicide method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, initiated self-harm with lethal intent).  
   - Self-harm ideation is present but not acted upon due to external constraints.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **distress, depression, and self-harm ideation** but lacks personal desire for death or suicide.  
   - Self-harm thoughts are explicitly contextualized as a coping strategy (not suicidal) and are currently inhibited.  
   - No suicidal ideation, plan, behavior, or attempt is identified. Falls under **Indicator** due to general distress and non-suicidal self-harm ideation.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions death/dying (""when I die"", ""if I'm dead""), expresses emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""my pain is finally over"", ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""), and implies a desire for death as a relief. There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The language is future-oriented and general, with no indication of imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The writer's stated desire is clear: death is presented as the solution to their pain, indicating a genuine wish for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it directly expresses a desire for death (e.g., ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""). This shows a personal and current wish to not be alive. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, it is not 'Indicator' and leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or intended actions are mentioned. The focus is on the outcome (death as relief) rather than how it might be achieved. Without any indication of a plan, method, or imminent action, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses a future desire (""when I die"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no references to attempts or self-harm). It is entirely prospective, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead""), which aligns with 'Ideation' (defined as explicit expressions of wanting life to end without a plan/method). It lacks any plan, preparation, or action element for 'Behavior'. Phrases like ""I hate living"" (or equivalents here) are considered 'Ideation', and there is no ambiguity about unwanted thoughts. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' is irrelevant. The distress is present, but the explicit suicidal desire places it in 'Ideation' over 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" and ""I don't want to live.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""life is all downhill,"" ""ruined dreams,"" ""nothing in my life"").  
   - Preparation/imminence: ""Goodbye"" implies finality; ""stay here about a month longer"" suggests delayed but impending action.  
   - Desire: Unambiguous wish to die (""I finally decided,"" ""I don't want to live"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - Clear desire to die: ""I don't want to live"" (Yes).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - ""Take the leap"" metaphorically implies action but lacks specificity about method/tools.  
   - ""Goodbye"" signals preparation (e.g., farewell).  
   - Imminence: ""About a month longer"" indicates intent but not immediate urgency.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intention (""decided to take the leap"").  
   - No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (≠ Indicator).  
   - Vague reference to action (""take the leap"") + preparation (""goodbye"") but no concrete plan/method.  
   - Falls under **Behavior**: Intent to act is clear (""decided""), and ""goodbye"" implies preparatory steps, despite method vagueness.

116,"Playing my favourite video game one last time before i end it all. Playing witcher 3 before i call it quits. Honestly, i feel so relaxed that it's finally ending. 22 years on this earth was enough for me. Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""it's finally ending,"" which are indirect references to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" ""the last 1 year the less said the better"") and a sense of relief (""I feel so relaxed that it's finally ending""). There is a mention of a preparatory action (""Playing my favourite video game one last time""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or detailed preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) are described. The temporal context is future-oriented, with high imminence implied by ""one last time before I end it all,"" suggesting action is planned soon after playing. The writer expresses a clear desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die through phrases like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""it's finally ending."" These are euphemisms for suicide but convey explicit intent in context. There is no negation of desire (e.g., no statement that thoughts are unwanted), so this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (tools, substances, locations) is mentioned or strongly implied; ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" are vague. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" indicates a final activity but does not constitute direct preparation for suicide (e.g., it is not a method, plan, or action like acquiring means). Despite high imminence (""before I end it all"") and strong intent, the vagueness means there is no clear plan or method. Per the rules, if uncertain, lean toward 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""before I end it all"") with no reference to past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts like ""I tried""). The life history (""22 years... 21 were enjoyable"") is not a suicidal action. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die, fitting 'Ideation'. However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The preparatory-like activity (playing a game) is not sufficient for 'Behavior' as it lacks a suicidal action element. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the clear desire to die. 'Attempt' is not relevant as no past action is described. Ambiguity around plan/method (despite imminence) supports 'Ideation' per guidelines.

117,I need help. So I met this person on reddit who I am sort of friends with. But She wrote three days ago that she had tried to kill herself and she is now on restrictions at home. She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post is written by someone expressing concern about a friend they met on Reddit. The friend reportedly attempted suicide three days ago and is now on restrictions. The author states they are scared and seeking help to check on the friend's well-being. Key elements include:
     - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: Yes, but only in reference to the friend (""she had tried to kill herself""). No mention of death, dying, or self-harm related to the author.
     - Emotional indicators: The author expresses distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and worry, but this is focused on the friend's situation, not personal hopelessness, despair, or self-directed hatred.
     - Plans, methods, preparations: None mentioned for the author. The friend's attempt is described, but this is not the author's action.
     - Past actions: The author references the friend's past suicide attempt, not their own. No indication of any self-initiated action by the author.
     - Imminence: No imminent intentions expressed by the author.
     - Desire: The author shows no personal desire to die or for their own life to end. Instead, they are seeking reassurance about their friend's safety.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not contain any explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar from the author. The only suicidal reference is about the friend.
   - There is no expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end from the author (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned for the author, so the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply.
   - Conclusion: No explicit or implied suicidal intent from the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the author. The author's focus is on their friend, not on any personal suicidal behavior.
   - Even with high imminence or intent considered, there is no vague or indirect reference to the author taking action against themselves.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event (the friend's suicide attempt), but it is not an action initiated by the author. The author has not described any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions.
   - The author's current state is one of concern and seeking help, not reporting personal suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") due to an external event (the friend's situation), but there is no personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions from the author.
   - This aligns with the **Indicator** category: The distress is about someone else's suicide-related behavior, and the author lacks any clear, current, personal suicidal intent. The content does not meet the criteria for Ideation (no personal desire to die), Behavior (no plan or preparation), or Attempt (no self-initiated action).
   - Rule adherence: The classification must be based solely on the author, not the friend mentioned. The author's distress is real but not indicative of personal suicide risk beyond general concern.

I'm now looking for something that I can tie and that will kill me with it I don't want to be alone anymore I've been alone since I was 5 and haven't had a friend because of bullying since I was also 5 I only sit in my room alone everyday it makes me sick and I am scared to go out Self-harm doesn't help me anymore, nobody has ever liked me and just made fun of me and used me I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I will hang myself now,"" indicating a specific method (hanging) and immediate intent (""now""). The user is actively preparing by ""looking for something that I can tie"" to use for suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""nobody has ever liked me,"" self-harm no longer helping). There is a clear desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted. No past suicide attempts are described; self-harm is mentioned but not framed as a past suicidal action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly mentions ""hang myself,"" which is an explicit suicide reference. It also expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""that will kill me""). There is no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (hanging) is mentioned. Preparation is evident: the user is actively seeking means (""looking for something that I can tie""). Imminence is high due to ""now."" Combined with explicit intent, this indicates 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions and preparations. There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself"" or similar). Self-harm is referenced but not as a suicide attempt, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan/method/preparation with high imminence rules out 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (no plan). No past initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The active seeking of means and stated immediacy align with 'Behavior'.

119,"I feel so shattered. I don't even know any more. I just feel shitty. There is no rhyme or reason. It's not even that I just want to die.

It feels like I am being ripped apart and put back together incorrectly. I can't stop shaking. How am I supposed to live like this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of being ""shattered,"" ""shitty,"" ""miserable,"" and an inability to function. Key phrases highlight hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't even know how to just live anymore,"" ""How am I supposed to live like this?"") and physical symptoms like shaking.
   - Crucially, the author explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" directly negating any desire for death or suicide. There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.
   - The focus is on describing profound misery and dysfunction without any suicidal intent, means, or actions. No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - The author denies a desire to die (""It's not even that I just want to die""), which clearly indicates no personal wish for death. Expressions like ""I hate living"" are absent, and the overall sentiment is distress about life circumstances rather than a desire to end life.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not present and the desire for death is explicitly negated, this strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No references to methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans, preparations, or intended actions. The content is entirely about emotional and physical suffering, with no indication of how or when suicidal behavior might occur.
   - With no desire to die expressed (and it being negated), there is no basis for considering 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings only, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and misery but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. The explicit negation of wanting to die (""It's not even that I just want to die"") confirms that suicidal thoughts are not present or are unwanted. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition: distress without current, personal suicidal intent. There is no ambiguity for 'Ideation' (which requires desire to die) or higher categories.

In the beginning I thought: well, I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they don't have time. Well, how did they thank me? By giving me more. I can't handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming. yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I just want to kill myself"" and repeats ""I want out now"" in the context of despair.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't see the need""), frustration with work, and existential despair (""Tf is this life?"").  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - The desire to die is personal, current, and not negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I won't do it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""I just want to kill myself"" is a direct, unambiguous expression of suicidal intent. ""I want out now"" reinforces a genuine desire for life to end.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations. The focus is on the *desire* to escape life, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions (""now""), but **no past or recent initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no references to attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current initiated actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Strong personal desire to die rules out **Indicator** (which requires ambiguous/unwanted thoughts).  

**Conclusion**: Fits 'Ideation' due to clear suicidal desire without plans/actions.

You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with ""AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""DIE""), expressing a direct personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""you have no skills valuable to other people""), self-loathing (""everyone hates themselves""), and references to suicidal thoughts as a ""cope.""  
   - Specific methods are described in detail: ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters,"" ""make nitroglycerin at home,"" and targeting ""biggest power plants.""  
   - Preparations are implied through instructions like ""research where to find the parts"" and ""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants.""  
   - The phrase ""if you change your mind and you want to do it"" suggests future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I WANT TO DIE"" is an explicit personal desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but **not** framed as unwanted; instead, they are rationalized (""another distraction"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (e.g., explosives via ""nitroglycerin,"" sabotage with ""wire cutters"") and locations (""power plants"") are mentioned.  
   - Preparations include researching parts and planning a ""vacation"" to a target site.  
   - High imminence is implied through actionable instructions (""Learn how to make..."").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intentions** (""if you change your mind and you want to do it"").  
   - **No** past or recent self-initiated lethal actions by the author are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I WANT TO DIE"") confirms **Ideation** as a baseline.  
   - Detailed methods (explosives, sabotage) and preparations (research, targeting locations) elevate this to **Behavior**.  
   - No mention of past attempts by the author; the instructional tone focuses on future action.

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now.

She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS: Key elements in the post**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The post includes the phrase ""do the world a favor and go kill yourself,"" but this is a quote from the bully directed at the friend, not a personal expression from the author. No other mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods by the author.
   - Emotional indicators: The author describes their friend as ""mentally disturbed,"" ""constantly tired,"" overwhelmed, not eating well, and not going out, indicating distress. However, these are observations about the friend, not the author's own emotions. The author expresses concern and a desire for justice but does not describe personal hopelessness, despair, or anhedonia.
   - Plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned by the author. The only suicidal content is external (the bully's words).
   - Past actions: No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm by the author.
   - Imminence: No stated intentions or imminent plans from the author.
   - Desire to die: The author shows no personal desire to die or for life to end. The focus is on helping the friend and seeking retribution against the bully.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**
   - No, the author does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases in a personal context. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is attributed to the bully.
   - No, the author does not express a personal desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end. The author's statements are about the friend's distress and their own proactive efforts to support the friend and seek justice.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned by the author, so the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply.
   - Conclusion: Suicide/death is not personally expressed or desired by the author, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned by the author in relation to personal suicidal intent.
   - The author's actions (e.g., trying to get the friend to eat, considering posting the bully's information) are protective and proactive, not indicative of personal suicidal behavior.
   - Conclusion: No elements of plan, method, or preparation for the author, so not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**
   - The post describes a current situation of bullying and its effects on the friend, but no past or recent suicidal actions by the author are mentioned.
   - No initiated self-harm or suicide attempts by the author are described.
   - Conclusion: No basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**
   - The post expresses general distress about the friend's bullying and the author's frustration, but there is no personal suicidal desire, ideation, plan, or past attempt from the author.
   - Mentions of suicide (e.g., ""go kill yourself"") are abstract and contextual, stemming from the bully's harassment, not the author's own thoughts or feelings.
   - The author's language is focused on external actions (helping the friend, seeking justice), not internal despair or suicidal intent.
   - Ambiguity: There is no genuine ambiguity about personal suicidal desire; the author clearly lacks it, so 'Indicator' is appropriate.
   - Rules: Classification is based solely on the author's risk, not the friend's. Even though the friend is distressed, the author's post does not indicate personal suicide risk beyond general distress.
   - Final category: Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" and ""I want to hang myself so bad,"" indicating direct references to suicide and a specific method (hanging). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have nothing to look forward to""), despair (""I feel so alone""), and self-loathing (""I am a loser, ugly, no motivation""). There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) or past suicide attempts. The author references having ""tried to reach out"" for help, but this is not a suicidal action. Imminence is implied (""I don't know how much longer I could last"") but not specific (e.g., ""tonight""). The author expresses a strong desire to die (""I want to hang myself so bad"") but also a ""small piece of hope"" that is currently preventing action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to hang myself so bad""). The suicidal thoughts are not described as unwanted; instead, they are presented as persistent and desired, despite the presence of hope. This aligns with 'Ideation' or higher, not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""hang myself""), which is directly tied to the suicidal intent. No preparations or intended actions (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the explicit reference to a method, combined with the desire to die, meets the threshold for 'Behavior'. The lack of high imminence does not override the presence of a specific method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and desires but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. References to ""tried to reach out"" relate to seeking help, not a suicide attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit personal desire to die and a specific method (hanging), moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires only general distress or explicitly unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). This fits 'Behavior' due to the method mention, even without preparations or high imminence. The author's ambivalence (hope) does not negate the presence of suicidal intent with a method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a recent suicide attempt (""last night I attempted once again"") and references multiple past attempts (""my 15th time""). It also expresses a current desire to attempt suicide again (""still want to attempt again"") but tempers this with a reason to live (""I found one thing to live for""). There is no mention of specific methods, plans, or preparations for future attempts. Barriers to seeking help (e.g., no health insurance, COVID risk) are discussed, but these do not indicate imminent action.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness is implied in phrases like ""still alive unfortunately"" and the resignation in ""I guess ill stay alive,"" but the primary focus is on past actions and current ambivalence.
   - Explicit suicide/death intent: Yes, through direct references to attempts and the desire to attempt again.
   - Plan/method/preparation: No details on methods for past or future attempts; only the act of ""attempting"" is mentioned vaguely. For the current desire, no plan, method, or preparation is indicated.
   - Temporal context: Describes a very recent, self-initiated action (""last night I attempted""), which is a concrete past event. Current thoughts are expressed (""still want to attempt again"") but with no imminence or action plan.
   - Stated desire: The desire to die is present in the want to attempt, but it is partially negated by the reason to live, though not explicitly stated as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempted"" (referring to suicide) and ""want to attempt again,"" indicating a clear personal desire for death/suicide. The reason to live shows ambivalence but does not negate the desire as explicitly unwanted (e.g., it is not phrased as ""I have thoughts but don't want them"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned for past or future attempts. References to attempts are vague (e.g., ""attempted"" without details), and the current desire lacks any indication of a plan or imminent action. Therefore, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""last night I attempted once again."" This is a specific attempt that occurred very recently. It also references a history of such actions (""my 15th time""). The description of this past attempt is clear and initiated by the author, fitting the 'Attempt' definition. Current thoughts of wanting to attempt again are present but do not describe a new initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of a recent suicide attempt (""last night""), which is a past initiated action. Per the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past action is clearly described, even if current ideation is present (e.g., ""still want to attempt again""). The current thoughts lack a plan or method, so they would be 'Ideation' if considered alone, but the historical action dominates.
   - There is no ambiguity: The post does not fit 'Indicator' (as suicidal desire is explicit and personal), 'Ideation' (due to the described past action), or 'Behavior' (no plan/method for future intent). The mention of past attempts, especially the recent one, solidifies 'Attempt'.

I can feel myself falling asleep, but as I've done this before, I know I'll wake up. I just want to be checked up on, but I don't want to bother my friends with it. Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense distress (""at the end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling""), hopelessness (""I don't see a reason""), physical symptoms (""breath slowing down,"" ""chest hurting""), and a desire for death (""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up""). It references past actions (""I've done this before,"" ""I know I'll wake up later"") implying previous suicidal behaviors where the author survived. The author mentions fear of acting (""too scared to go all the way through"") and not wanting to burden friends, but the core desire to not wake up is present. No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is explicitly mentioned for the current situation, though ""falling asleep"" could vaguely imply an action. The temporal context includes current distress (""right now"") and past events (""done this before"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but the post expresses a clear personal desire for death (e.g., ""I hope I don't wake up"") in a context of despair. Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, there's ambivalence (fear vs. desire). This confirms genuine suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is described for the current situation. References to ""go all the way through"" and ""falling asleep"" are vague and not clearly linked to a method or imminent action. The author states being ""too scared to go all the way through,"" indicating no current intended action. High imminence (""right now"") is present, but without a concrete plan or method, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions: ""I've done this before"" and ""I know I'll wake up"" clearly refer to previous suicide attempts (e.g., implied overdoses or similar acts) where the author survived. This is mentioned in the context of current feelings (""I feel my breath slowing down,"" ""I hope I don't wake up""), making it relevant. The historical nature does not disqualify it as an 'Attempt' per the guidelines. Current expressions are ideation, but the past attempt takes precedence.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - 'Attempt' is the best fit because the author describes past initiated suicidal actions (""I've done this before""), which is concrete and potentially lethal, regardless of when it occurred. This overshadows the current suicidal ideation (""I hope I don't wake up"") and lack of current plan/method. 'Ideation' is secondary due to the desire expressed, but 'Attempt' has precedence. 'Behavior' doesn't apply due to no current plan, and 'Indicator' is ruled out by the explicit death desire.

I hope you don't make mistakes like me. Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances. I know after I am done doing what I need to do, I won't have anymore chances. I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I could die,"" ""attempt could fail.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have ran out of chances""), self-perceived failure (""true failure""), worthlessness (""should've never given me your time"").  
   - Specific method: ""shoot myself"" (gun).  
   - Preparations: ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""room is empty,"" ""everything is gone,"" ""no more savings,"" deletion of other accounts.  
   - Imminence: ""not sure what will happen once I post this,"" ""Too late to turn back now,"" ""I am going to shoot myself.""  
   - Desire: Strong, unambiguous wish to die (""I am not giving myself anymore chances""). No negation of desire.  
   - Past actions: Mentions prior suicidal intent since June but explicitly states ""I never did it."" No description of a past initiated suicide attempt.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""shoot myself,"" ""I could die.""  
   - Clear desire: ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I have ran out of chances.""  
   - No indication thoughts are unwanted; desire is affirmed. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""shoot myself"" with a ""loaded gun.""  
   - Preparations: Gun present, room emptied, accounts/savings liquidated.  
   - Imminence: Action contingent on posting (""once I post this""). → **Plan/method/preparation confirmed**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future** intent (""I am going to shoot myself"") with imminent timing (""once I post this"").  
   - **No past initiated action**: States ""I never did it"" regarding prior intent. References a *potential* future attempt (""attempt could fail""), not a completed past act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (gun) + preparations (gun present, room emptied) = **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action described (only future intent) → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Plan/method eliminates 'Ideation'. Unambiguous desire eliminates 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The author explicitly states they ""tried to pass [die] a week ago"" and describes a suicide attempt involving swallowing bleach. Details include leaving a suicide note, grabbing bleach, swallowing it, vomiting, and experiencing physical effects (heartburn). Emotional context includes depression, stress, and a suicidal episode triggered by a fight. Current state is ""a little okay"" but with residual feelings (""it's still in there"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, phrases like ""tried to pass"" (euphemism for suicide attempt) and ""suicide episode"" explicitly confirm intent. The suicide note (""last time with them"") further reinforces a desire to die at the time of the event.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparations (writing a suicide note, acquiring bleach) are clearly described. The action was initiated and carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""a week ago""). The author details initiating the act (swallowing bleach) with a clear outcome (vomiting/survival). Timeframe (""a week ago"") does not negate this as an 'Attempt' per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is a detailed account of a **past suicide attempt** (initiated action with lethal means). This meets the 'Attempt' definition, which prioritizes described past actions regardless of current state. While current distress (""still in there"") is noted, the historical attempt is the focal point and explicitly linked to their experience. No current plan/method is mentioned, but the past attempt itself categorizes this as 'Attempt'.

128,"The only reason I'm alive is cause my parents are still alive. Long story short, I lost my sibling this year and ever since my anxiety and depression has gotten a lot worse. After the funeral I basically lost all will to live. But I tried to pull through and find things to do to occupy my time. I thought I was getting better and moving on but I realise when I stop doing everything and sit alone, I still want to die. The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I still want to die,"" expressing a personal desire for death. It references emotional distress like hopelessness (""lost all will to live"") and worsening anxiety/depression after a sibling's death. There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, means), or past suicidal actions initiated by the author. The phrase ""the only thing stopping me"" implies a barrier (concern for parents) but no intent or plan to act. Timeframe is vague (""still"" indicates ongoing feelings), with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire to die is personal and current, not abstract or unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die with ""I still want to die."" This is a clear, current statement of suicidal ideation. The desire is not negated as unwanted (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don't want these thoughts""); instead, it is acknowledged and suppressed only by external factors (parents' feelings). Phrases like ""lost all will to live"" and ""want to die"" strongly imply genuine suicidal desire, aligning with Ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation, or intended action is mentioned or implied. The statement ""the only thing stopping me"" suggests contemplation but no concrete steps, means, or imminence. Without any reference to how, when, or where the author might act, this lacks elements for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings (""I still want to die"") and past coping efforts (""tried to pull through""), but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). References to the sibling's death and funeral are contextual but not actions by the author. Thus, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I still want to die"") with no plan/method/preparation places this in 'Ideation'. The presence of a barrier (parents) does not negate the personal suicidal desire, and the thoughts are not framed as unwanted or intrusive (which would be Indicator). There is no ambiguity about plan/method to warrant Behavior, and no past action for Attempt.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" indicates prolonged suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths,"" ""darkest corners,"" and resignation to outcomes (""I'm fine with either outcome"") imply hopelessness.  
   - Method: References taking LSD (""a few tabs of acid"") as an alternative to suicide, but this is not a suicide method; it’s framed as a potential coping mechanism.  
   - Imminence/Intent: ""My end will only get nearer"" suggests a passive expectation of suicide if LSD fails, but no specific plan, timeline, or method for suicide is stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""thinking of suicide"" directly states suicidal ideation.  
   - Desire to die: ""My end will only get nearer"" implies acceptance of death as an outcome. No negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"") is present. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) mentioned. LSD use is presented as a *non-suicidal* intervention.  
   - No preparations (e.g., note, acquiring tools). ""My end will only get nearer"" is vague and lacks actionable intent. → **No plan/method/preparation**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts (""months on end"") but no past or recent self-initiated lethal actions (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (via ""suicide"" and ""my end"") meets criteria for **Ideation**.  
   - Lack of method/preparation/plan rules out **Behavior**. Absence of past self-initiated actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is evident, the personal expression of suicidal desire moves this beyond **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions hitting a ""new low,"" stealing the dog's prescription hydrocodone to ""feel ok for one night,"" drinking alcohol, and expressing prolonged distress (""i havent felt ok in a while"") and uncertainty (""im not sure what to do""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (e.g., ""hit a new low,"" ""havent felt ok"") and hopelessness (""not sure what to do"") are present, but there is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The hydrocodone use is framed as a coping mechanism to ""feel ok,"" not as a suicidal act.
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The hydrocodone incident is described as a current coping behavior, not an attempt to die.
   - Imminence: Actions occurred ""tonight,"" but they are not tied to suicidal intent.
   - Desire: The author expresses a desire to ""feel ok,"" not a desire to die or end life. No suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted) are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The focus is on seeking relief from distress.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, there is no indication of unwanted suicidal ideation. The absence of suicidal desire points away from Ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance (beyond general hydrocodone/alcohol misuse), location, or preparation linked to suicide. The hydrocodone is taken to cope, not as part of a suicidal plan.
   - No implied or vague references to suicidal action, even with imminence. The behavior (misuse) is risky but not suicidal in intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a recent event (taking hydrocodone and drinking ""tonight"") but not as a suicidal action. The author frames it as a low point and coping mechanism.
   - No mention of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no references to ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" suicide).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress, despair, and risky coping (drug/alcohol misuse), but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt. 
   - Without suicidal intent, it cannot be Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt. 
   - Fits 'Indicator': Expresses emotional distress and life dissatisfaction, but no suicidal thoughts or actions. The hydrocodone/alcohol use, while concerning, is not presented as self-harm or suicide-related.

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore""), despair (""Nothing in my life is working out""), and social isolation (""I don't have any friends""). There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No plans, preparations, or timeframes (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The writer is conveying a profound dissatisfaction with life and a sense of purposelessness, but not explicitly describing suicidal actions or methods.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are present. The statement ""I see no point in living anymore"" implies a desire for life to end or not to be alive, which aligns with expressions like ""life isn't worth it"" from the Ideation definition. The desire is not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), so it leans toward personal suicidal ideation rather than general distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), preparation (e.g., note-writing), or intended action. The post is solely about emotional state and life circumstances, with no indication of how or when the writer might act on their feelings.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings only; there are no references to past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) or future intentions with specificity. It is focused on present hopelessness.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The expression ""I see no point in living anymore"" is a clear personal desire for life to end, similar to ""I hate living"" or ""life isn't worth it,"" which defines Ideation. There is no ambiguity about the desire being unwanted (as it is not negated), and no plan/method is present, ruling out Behavior. No past actions are described, so Attempt does not apply. General distress is present, but the explicit personal wish for life to end elevates it to Ideation over Indicator.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" which directly references a specific method (pills) for self-harm and implies potential death.
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel so guilty""), feelings of being a burden (""It's unfair on them,"" ""They deserve so much more than me""), and despair.
   - There is a clear description of a self-initiated action: ""taken a fuck load of pills,"" indicating the action has already occurred.
   - The timeframe is imminent, as the outcome (""might not wake up tomorrow"") is expected soon.
   - The writer expresses a desire for death through the action, with no indication that these thoughts or actions are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a desire to die through the action described (e.g., taking pills to avoid waking up).
   - Phrases like ""might not wake up tomorrow"" convey a clear personal wish for life to end in the context of despair, without any negation of the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (pills) is mentioned in relation to the suicidal act.
   - The action has already been taken (""taken""), indicating preparation and execution, not just planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past/recent self-initiated action: ""taken a fuck load of pills."" This is a concrete, potentially lethal act initiated by the author.
   - The action is framed as having just occurred, with imminent consequences (""might not wake up tomorrow""), making it a recent event.
   - This fits the definition of an 'Attempt' because it is a self-initiated, potentially lethal action, regardless of when it happened (it is mentioned in the context of current feelings).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of a described past/recent self-initiated action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that is potentially lethal qualifies this as 'Attempt' under the category definition.
   - While there are elements of emotional distress and guilt, the core of the post is the description of an action taken, which takes precedence over current ideation or behavior.
   - This is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' involves planning or preparation for future action, whereas here the action has already occurred. It is not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' because a specific lethal action was initiated.

I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times: ""planning out my suicide"", ""fear of failing an attempt once again"", and ""intend to do it right this time"".
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""tired of the constant struggle"", ""can't find a reason... to continue living"") and a sense of burden (""will not usher my burden into anyone else"").
   - Specific plans are indicated: the author has a set timeframe (""beginning of the new year, come January 1st"") and references past actions (""failing an attempt once again"").
   - Imminence is present but not immediate (January 1st is future-dated).
   - The author expresses a strong, unreserved desire to die, with no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are resolved to act (""I will go through with this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly uses terms like ""suicide"" and ""attempt"".
   - Yes, there is a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I can't find a reason... to continue living"", ""I will go through with this"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; the author affirms their intention to act, negating 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific plan is mentioned with a timeframe (January 1st), but no explicit method (e.g., tools or location) is detailed.
   - Preparations are implied in ""planning out my suicide"" and the intent to avoid detection (""not make those around me suffer"").
   - High intent and imminence (specific date) could suggest 'Behavior', but the lack of method details creates some ambiguity. However, the primary focus shifts due to the past action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes both future intentions and a past event: ""failing an attempt once again"" clearly indicates a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (a past suicide attempt) that failed.
   - This past attempt is directly linked to current feelings (fear of failing again and resolve to succeed), making it relevant to the 'Attempt' category, regardless of when it occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence because the author explicitly describes a past initiated suicidal action (""failing an attempt once again""), which is a key criterion. This overshadows the current ideation and behavioral elements (like the future plan).
   - While there are expressions of desire (Ideation) and planning (Behavior), the clear reference to a past attempt by the author, mentioned in the context of their current state, solidifies 'Attempt' as the best fit.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""do it now"" (implying suicide). It expresses hopelessness (""wish i was never born""), feeling like a burden (""i dont want to weigh down my family and friends""), and ambivalence due to fear (""i am to scared to kill myself""). There is contemplation of acting (""wonder if i should just do it now"") but no specific method, plan, or preparation described (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned). The temporal context is present/future-oriented with no reference to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die through phrases like ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"" and ""I actually hate being alive."" The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted or distanced (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""); instead, the barrier is fear, not a lack of desire. Thus, this is not 'Indicator' (where thoughts must be explicitly unwanted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. References to action are vague (""do it now"") and coupled with high fear and inaction (""i am to scared,"" ""For now i guess i will just sit here""). While imminence is suggested (""do it now""), the lack of any concrete plan or method, and the explicit statement of fear preventing action, means this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and future contemplation (""should just do it now,"" ""if i wait for later"") but describes no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""do not want to live,"" ""hate being alive""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguous or unwanted suicidal thoughts). The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation—despite the expressed desire—means it does not qualify as 'Behavior' (which requires at least some indication of how or when beyond vague intent). The fear of acting and lack of action description reinforce this as 'Ideation'. There is no past action for 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post centers on suicidal thoughts and desire without actionable elements.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes a specific method: hanging. It details preparations (leaving a chair or elevated object to stand on) to prevent death. The action is frequent and self-initiated but designed not to be lethal (""so i don't die""). There is no expression of a genuine desire to die; instead, the intent is negated by the safety measure and the phrase ""half heartedly."" Emotional indicators like despair are not explicitly stated, but the behavior suggests distress. The timeframe is ongoing (""frequently"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide,"" but the desire to die is clearly negated by the explanation that the actions are not intended to result in death (""so i don't die""). The phrase ""half heartedly"" further indicates a lack of genuine suicidal intent. This leans strongly toward 'Indicator' because the suicidal behavior is explicitly unwanted and not driven by a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (hanging) and preparations (leaving a chair/elevated object) are mentioned. However, these are coupled with the explicit negation of lethal intent and are part of a non-lethal action. Since there is no indication of a plan or method intended to cause death, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior,' which requires suicidal desire plus a plan/method for a lethal outcome.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past/ongoing actions (""frequently""), but these are not potentially lethal due to the safety measures. Therefore, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt' (which requires initiated actions that were potentially lethal). The actions are self-initiated but controlled to avoid death, so they are not suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key factor is the explicit lack of desire to die, despite the suicide-related actions. This aligns with 'Indicator,' which includes expressions of suicidal thoughts or behaviors that are explicitly unwanted or not representing a current personal desire to die. The presence of actions does not override the negated intent, as 'Behavior' requires both desire and plan/method for lethal action, which are absent here. 'Ideation' is not applicable because the focus is on actions, not just thoughts. 'Attempt' is ruled out because the actions were not potentially lethal. There is no ambiguity in the lack of suicidal desire after considering the context.

136,"I wanna move anymore. hey. You don't know me but I figured I could let things out here, my family just had a huge fight over all of our problems and stuff. I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide history: ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" ""i had an attempt when I was 14,"" and ""a few close calls.""  
   - Expresses current hopelessness: ""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me.""  
   - No explicit current plan, method, or preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - References a past suicide attempt (""attempt when I was 14"") as a self-initiated action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I've been suicidal,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" and ""this world's just not meant for me,"" indicating a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan/method**: Describes past actions (""attempt,"" ""close calls"") but no current plan, tools, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past action confirmed**: Clearly describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal past attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14""). Mentions ""close calls"" (additional past behaviors).  
   - **Linked to current state**: References past attempts in the context of ongoing struggles (""I've been suicidal for 6 years,"" current hopelessness).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt takes precedence**: The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt initiated by the author. Historical attempts qualify as 'Attempt' when mentioned by the author in relation to their current state, per guidelines.  
   - Current expressions (""I don't want to go on"") indicate ongoing ideation but do not override the clear description of a past attempt.  
   - No current plan/method/preparation, so 'Behavior' is not applicable.  
   - **Ruling out others**:  
     - Not 'Indicator' due to explicit desire to die.  
     - Not 'Ideation' because past attempt is described.  
     - Not 'Behavior' due to absence of current plan/action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post begins with a statement about the author's life situation: ""I am 29 still live with my parents,"" which may imply distress, frustration, or feelings of inadequacy. The second part consists of gibberish (""4kdjejdne sjdjd"") and profanity (""fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo""), indicating emotional outburst or anger but no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. No emotional indicators like hopelessness, despair, or being a burden are present. There is no reference to plans, methods, preparations, past actions, timeframes, or imminence. The content expresses frustration but lacks any suicidal desire, thoughts, or intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. No expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The post focuses on life circumstances and emotional frustration, not death or suicidal ideation. Since suicidal thoughts are absent, there is no need to assess if they are unwanted. The content does not imply a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No indication of a plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for suicide. The gibberish and profanity do not suggest any action or intention related to self-harm. With no suicidal desire identified, this step is irrelevant.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current life situation and emotional state. No references to past actions, attempts, or future intentions involving suicide. The content is entirely present-focused and non-specific to self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress (frustration with living situation and emotional outburst) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt. Phrases like ""fuckkkkkkkk"" convey anger but not suicidal ideation. Without explicit or implied suicidal intent, and considering the absence of plan/action, the post fits 'Indicator'. It expresses distress but does not cross into suicidal territory. There is no ambiguity suggesting 'Ideation', as no desire to die is present. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are inapplicable due to the lack of suicidal content.

I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
    - Explicit mentions: ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself,"" ""start cutting again.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I just wish I could die in my sleep""), determination (""I'll break killing myself regardless"").
    - Plan/method: Specific method (""properly hang myself"") and alternative method (""start cutting again"" to ""increase my chances of corona"").
    - Preparations: Consideration of ""potential interference"" and strategizing to overcome it.
    - Imminence: ""One of these days"" implies future intent, not immediate.
    - Desire: Strong personal desire to die (""I'm not afraid... anymore,"" ""I'll finally do it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - Yes: Direct phrases like ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and ""wish I could die"" express a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
    - Yes: Specific method (""hang myself"") is mentioned, along with knowledge of execution (""figured out how to properly hang myself""). Alternative method (""cutting again"") is also specified. Preparations are implied through assessing ""interference"" and determination to overcome it (""I'll break... regardless"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
    - ""I've done it many times"" suggests past behaviors, but lacks confirmation of *initiated lethal actions* (e.g., ""tried to hang myself""). Focus is on future intent (""I'll finally do it,"" ""Maybe I'll... start cutting again"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - Strong explicit desire to die (Ideation base) + specific methods (hanging, cutting) + preparations (assessing interference) = **Behavior**.
    - Past references (""done it many times"") are ambiguous (could mean rehearsals/thoughts, not necessarily attempts). No confirmed past *initiated action* takes precedence over current plan/intent.
    - High intent and method specificity outweigh ""one of these days"" (non-immediate) vagueness.

Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all,"" indicating suicidal ideation.  
   - Emotional indicators include feeling ""doomed"" and fearing ""something worse"" if they keep existing, suggesting hopelessness.  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") are mentioned.  
   - The thoughts are described passively (""thoughts telling me"") and span ""over the course of a year,"" with no reference to past actions or imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""end it all"" implies suicidal thoughts.  
   - **However**, the phrasing (""thoughts telling me"") frames the ideation as an external/internal pressure rather than a personal desire. There is no explicit statement like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I weren’t alive."" Crucially, the author does not express a *genuine wish* to act on these thoughts or a desire for death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, preparations, or intended actions are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes persistent thoughts over a year but no past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly framed as intrusive/unwanted (""thoughts telling me""), aligning with 'Indicator' (distress about unwanted thoughts without personal desire to die).  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No past/current self-initiated lethal action → rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - While ""end it all"" suggests ideation, the lack of personal desire to die and the explicit depiction of thoughts as external/internal pressure leans toward 'Indicator'.

140,"Just another rant. Keep scrolling. Don't waste your time on a lost cause. I'm almost 30. Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like. My ""best friend"" distanced herself from me coz I'm depressed and she doesn't like sad vibes. I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor of the building I live in. But just as the coward I am, I chickened out each time. I am just a  Useless, shameless, pathetic loser. Why should I still live and waste the resources which can be used for something useful. I am a useless piece of garbage. Oh wait, garbage can be recycled or made into something. My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of suicide methods/actions: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor."" These are specific, self-initiated actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""lost cause,"" ""in hell""), self-hatred (""useless piece of garbage""), worthlessness (""waste resources""), and isolation.
   - Explicit references to past suicidal actions: Describes three distinct initiated attempts (drowning, hanging, jumping) that were aborted (""chickened out"").
   - No current plan/method/preparation mentioned; focus is on past actions and ongoing despair.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes. Strong desire implied (""Why should I still live"") alongside direct descriptions of past attempts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Methods are explicitly stated (drowning, hanging, jumping) but only in the context of **past actions**. No current plan/preparation described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Clearly describes **past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions** (attempts to drown, hang, jump). The phrase ""I tried"" confirms initiation. Timeframe is unspecified but presented as historical context for current feelings.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the suicide risk here is the author’s detailed description of **past suicide attempts**. Rules specify: ""Attempt"" applies if a ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated action"" is described, regardless of when it occurred. Current distress/ideation (""Why should I live"") exists but is secondary to the documented attempts.
   - This overrides potential classification as Ideation/Behavior due to the clear precedence rule: **""Attempt takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described.""**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" explicitly. 
   - Expresses hopelessness (""Living is not for me,"" ""Living is just so frustrating""), frustration, and untreated anxiety. 
   - Refers to past suicidal thoughts (""I would have been gone when I was 15"") and current increased confidence to act (""becoming more confident to kill myself""). 
   - Indicates imminent intent: ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" suggests preparation/action. 
   - No specific method or plan details (e.g., tools, locations), but ""do it"" implies intended action. 
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on these thoughts"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""kill myself"" and references suicide as a desired outcome (""I would have been gone at 15""). 
   - **Yes**: Strong desire to die implied by ""Living is not for me"" and confidence in acting. No unwanted-thought qualifiers (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, jumping), but ""get the courage to do it"" implies *intended action*. 
   - **Preparation indicated**: Building confidence (""becoming more confident"") and seeking ""courage"" to act suggests psychological preparation. 
   - **Intent + Imminence**: High intent (""might actually"") coupled with action-oriented language leans toward Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **Past**: Ideation at age 15 (no action described). 
   - **Current/Future**: Focus on present/future intent to act (""becoming more confident,"" ""might actually do it""). 
   - **No past initiated action**: Mentions past ideation but no description of an *attempt* (e.g., ""I tried X"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") + action-oriented language (""get the courage to do it"") = **Behavior**. 
   - Distinction from Ideation: While no concrete method is named, the progression from ideation (""would have been gone"") to stated readiness to act (""might actually do it"") implies intended behavior. 
   - Not Attempt: No past initiated lethal action described. 
   - Not Indicator: Unambiguous personal desire to die with movement toward action. 
   - Imminence (""might actually"") + intent tips vague ""do it"" toward Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" directly references impending death. ""If you wanted to die you would"" implies suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: ""the pain is too much"" expresses hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""I have enough Trazodone"" (a medication that can be lethal in overdose) and ""will get alcohol today"" (a substance that can potentiate overdose) indicate a specific method. ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" specifies high imminence.
   - References to past actions: ""taught me to hide it better"" refers to concealing suicidal thoughts but does not describe a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt).
   - Imminence: ""today"" and ""in less than 24 hours"" indicate immediate intent.
   - Stated desire: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use exact phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""be dead"" and the context of ""if you wanted to die you would"" explicitly convey a personal desire for death. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, explicit intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: using Trazodone and alcohol for a potentially lethal overdose.
   - Preparations are indicated: having ""enough Trazodone"" and planning to ""get alcohol today.""
   - Coupled with high imminence (""today,"" ""less than 24 hours"") and explicit desire to die, this confirms a plan and intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""will get,"" ""be dead in less than 24 hours""), not past actions. The reference to hiding feelings (""taught me to hide it better"") is about past thoughts or coping, not a self-initiated suicidal act. No description of a past attempt (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Not 'Indicator': There is a clear personal desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - Not 'Ideation': While there is explicit desire (""be dead""), the mention of a specific method (Trazodone + alcohol) and preparations (acquiring means) moves it beyond thoughts alone.
   - Not 'Attempt': No past or recent initiated suicidal action is described; all content is forward-looking.
   - 'Behavior' fits best: The post expresses suicidal intent with a plan (method and preparations) and high imminence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses deep hopelessness (""Every year I think things are going to get better, and they don't""), despair (""Nothing makes sense anymore""), anhedonia (""it's been so long since I've been happy""), feelings of being a burden (""Why the fuck am I alive... I bring nothing to the table""), and low self-worth (""My life has no worth. No meaning.""). The writer mentions ""I want to give up"" and guilt over their feelings, but there are no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The phrase ""I want to give up"" is ambiguous but, in context, appears to reflect emotional exhaustion rather than a direct desire to die. The writer also explicitly states distress about their ""obsessive negative thoughts,"" indicating these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end is expressed. Phrases like ""I want to give up"" and ""Why the fuck am I alive"" convey despair and worthlessness but lack the explicitness of statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living"" (which would lean toward Ideation). The writer's focus is on distress about their thoughts and situation, with no genuine wish to die implied. The explicit statement of being ""tired of my obsessive negative thoughts"" suggests these thoughts are unwanted and not representative of a personal desire to act on suicidal urges.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention or implication of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, preparation, or intended action. The content is entirely focused on emotional and cognitive distress, with no references to acting on suicidal thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing struggles since childhood and current feelings, but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). Mentions of past abuse are historical and not linked to any suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire, specific plans, methods, or preparations, ruling out Ideation, Behavior, and Attempt.
   - Strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, and unwanted negative thoughts align with 'Indicator', as the primary sentiment is distress without a current, personal suicidal intent. The ambiguity in phrases like ""I want to give up"" does not reach the threshold for Ideation (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be clearer), especially when coupled with the writer's explicit distress about their thoughts and lack of suicidal explicitness.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/dying/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill myself,"" ""for it to finally kill me,"" ""I'm going to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""cushion the pain""), fixation on death as a solution.  
   - Plan/method: Specific method identified (starvation via anorexia), target weight (78 pounds, possibly lower), and preparation (actively pursuing weight loss to achieve lethality).  
   - Imminence: Ongoing action (""currently weigh 90 pounds,"" ""new goal weight""), with intent to persist until death.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""kill myself,"" ""for it to finally kill me"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""let myself pass away,"" ""I'm going to die"").  
   - No negation of desire; instead, active pursuit of death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Starvation via anorexia.  
   - Preparation: Actively setting and adjusting goal weights (78 pounds or lower) to ensure lethality.  
   - Action: Ongoing effort to lose weight with the stated intent to die.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *current/future* self-initiated action (pursuing weight loss to die).  
   - No mention of past initiated lethal actions (e.g., no reference to prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + specific method (starvation) + active preparation (adjusting goal weight) = **Behavior**.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly and refers to a specific method: using a charcoal BBQ in a tent for carbon monoxide poisoning. It is framed as a question about feasibility (""Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?""). 
   - There are no emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) or expressions of personal desire to die. The focus is on the method's viability.
   - A specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent) is identified, but there is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring materials, setting up), intent to act, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous; the question implies consideration of the method but does not express a personal wish to die or for life to end, nor does it state that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (Yes).
   - It does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The question is about the method's possibility, not a statement of intent (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no explicit statement of unwanted thoughts.
   - Conclusion: While suicide is mentioned, the lack of personal desire expression leans this toward 'Indicator'. However, the method specificity requires further evaluation in step 3.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent) is mentioned in relation to suicide (Yes).
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., ""I have a BBQ,"" ""setting up a tent"") or intended action are stated; it is a feasibility question.
   - Explicit desire to die is not present (from step 2), so the method mention alone, without intent or imminence, does not strongly imply 'Behavior'. The question format suggests information-seeking rather than planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past or recent actions (e.g., no initiated suicide attempts). It is a forward-looking question about possibility.
   - No historical attempts are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), so it does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation'.
   - There is a specific method mentioned, but without an explicit expression of desire to die or intent to act, it does not qualify as 'Behavior' (which requires both desire and method/plan).
   - No past or recent initiated actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly (method feasibility question) without clear personal suicidal intent. Vague references to methods in a non-personal context fall under 'Indicator' when desire is not expressed. The ambiguity in desire (no explicit wish to die or negation of thoughts) after careful consideration aligns with 'Indicator'.

I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions feelings of worthlessness (""everything about me is wrong""), hopelessness (""only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life""), self-loathing (""embarrassment for everyone""), and explicit references to death (""everything that makes me want to die""). 
   - Key phrase: ""I don't feel like actually committing die"" explicitly negates active suicidal intent. 
   - No mention of methods, plans, preparations, or timelines for self-harm. Focus is on emotional pain and perceived burdensomeness (""everyone would be better off without dealing with me""). 
   - References past relationship struggles but no past suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - ""Want to die"" is mentioned but immediately followed by ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This explicitly rejects active intent or desire to act. Suicidal thoughts are framed as passive ideation (""*makes me* want to die"") and explicitly unwanted due to the negation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations. No implied or vague plans. The focus is on emotional suffering, not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, preparations). Only discusses ongoing feelings.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - ""Want to die"" suggests suicidal ideation, but the explicit negation (""I don't feel like actually committing die"") clarifies this as *distress about unwanted thoughts*, not a genuine desire to act. 
   - Dominant themes are hopelessness, burdensomeness, and self-criticism without plans or intent. 
   - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: expressions of distress with explicitly unwanted suicidal thoughts and no personal desire to die. 
   - Rules out 'Ideation' due to negated desire, 'Behavior' due to absence of plan/action, and 'Attempt' due to no described past actions.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The metaphor of treating oneself as a ""sick dog"" waiting to be ""put down"" directly implies a desire for death as relief. The phrase ""the 'dog' put itself down"" explicitly personalizes this as self-initiated death.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""Nothing's real,"" ""can't fix myself""), despair (""I'm tired,"" ""I don't want anything""), self-loathing (""I'm an abomination""), and feelings of being trapped.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: The ""3 weeks"" timeline acts as a preparation/waiting period (""waiting until it's sick enough to be put down""). The metaphor implies a method (euthanasia-like action), coupled with high imminence (""3 weeks"").  
   - Past actions: No description of past suicidal actions.  
   - Desire assessment: The metaphor expresses a *genuine wish for life to end* as relief (""put down""), not distress about unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases? No direct terms like ""suicide,"" but ""put itself down"" is a clear euphemism for self-inflicted death.  
   - Desire to die? Yes. The metaphor frames death as inevitable/desired (""Eventually it'll get sick enough... put down"").  
   - Unwanted thoughts? No negation; the thoughts are presented as logical conclusions.  
   → **Strong implicit desire to die**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method: Implied via the euthanasia metaphor (method = ""put down"").  
   - Preparation: Explicit timeline (""3 weeks to turn around,"" ""waiting until sick enough"").  
   - Imminence + intent: High (""3 weeks"" deadline + inevitability framing).  
   → **Plan/preparation present**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past/initiated suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted...""). Focus is on future intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Not **Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die is present (metaphor), and thoughts are not framed as unwanted.  
   - Not **Ideation**: Desire to die is coupled with a timeline (plan/preparation) and implied method (""put down"").  
   - Not **Attempt**: No description of past initiated actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Strong desire to die, with a timeline (preparation), implied method, and high imminence.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" and drafting a will (preparation).

   - Specific preparations: Drafting a will (stated as calming).  
   - References past actions: Ongoing plotting for months, will drafted ""yesterday.""  
   - Imminence: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""); current state is ""out of my hole for now.""

   - **No initiated lethal action**: No description of past/current self-harm (e.g., ""tried to"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire (""plotting suicide,"" obligation metaphor) moves beyond abstract distress.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Preparation (will) and method considerations (""weapon,"" discovery plan) indicate planning.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger, betrayal, exhaustion, and hopelessness directed at an unnamed individual (likely a caregiver). Key elements include:
   - Emotional indicators: Profound fatigue (""i'm so tired,"" ""i have no more energy""), despair (""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED""), and resentment about childhood trauma (""how can you do those sorts of things to a child"").
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
   - No references to past/present/future suicidal actions or preparations.
   - The phrase ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" expresses a wish for *another person's* death, not the author's own.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, self-harm, or personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"").
   - Expressions like ""i'm so tired"" and ""i have no more energy"" convey distress but **do not imply a wish for personal death**. The anger is externally focused (""FUCK YOU"").
   - **No** suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted) are expressed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No references to plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm/suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No description** of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). References to past events (""what they did to a child"") relate to trauma inflicted *on* the author, not actions *by* the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe emotional distress (anger, exhaustion, hopelessness) but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt**.
   - Phrases like ""i'm so tired"" and ""no more energy"" reflect burnout/depression but are **not equivalent to ""I hate living""** (which would indicate Ideation). The core sentiment is anguish directed outward, not inward suicidal intent.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long.

I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" but explicitly negates it with ""I don't want to kill myself."" It expresses hopelessness (""I really feel like nothing is going to change""), despair (""I'm so sick of this""), and feelings of stagnation and isolation. However, there are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The author emphasizes a desire for life improvement (""I really want to give life a chance,"" ""I want to have financial independence"") and differentiates dissatisfaction with their current situation from hating life itself (""I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life""). No imminence of suicidal action is indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""), but the author states they do not want this (""I don't want to kill myself""). The desire to die is negated, and expressions like ""I don't hate life"" further indicate distress about circumstances rather than a genuine wish to die. Suicidal thoughts, if present, are framed as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The content focuses on life frustrations without any indication of planning or intended action, even vaguely.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing life struggles but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interventions, or self-initiated harmful behaviors). The context is present-tense distress, not historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses general distress and mentions suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they do not want to act on them, aligning with the 'Indicator' definition. There is no clear desire to die (e.g., ""I don't hate life"" contrasts with ideation phrases like ""I want to die""), no plan/method for behavior, and no description of past attempts. The primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances, with suicidal thoughts being unwanted and negated.

I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating explicit suicidal desire and emotional distress (overwhelm, hopelessness, feeling ""too weak"").
   - Specific timeframe: ""tomorrow while my mom is out,"" implying imminence and contextual planning.
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.
   - Expresses internal conflict: ""I know I shouldn’t"" and ""too weak and pathetic to do it,"" but maintains a clear personal desire to die.
   - Focuses on the author’s own thoughts/feelings; no past suicidal actions described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die tomorrow."" The desire is personal and current, despite ambivalence (""I know I shouldn’t"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Plan: Mentions acting ""tomorrow while my mom is out,"" indicating a specific timeframe and contextual opportunity (high imminence). While no method is specified, the combination of explicit intent, high imminence (""tomorrow""), and situational planning (mom’s absence) implies an intended action.
   - No explicit method or preparations (e.g., tools, notes) noted.
   - Ambivalence (""too weak to do it"") does not negate the stated intent or plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes future intention (""tomorrow"") with no reference to past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire).
   - Specific temporal plan (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") coupled with high imminence and intent elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (thoughts without plan/action).
   - Lack of method/preparation creates ambiguity, but the contextual planning and imminence align with 'Behavior' (intended action).
   - 'Attempt' is inapplicable as no past/initiated action is described.
   - Final decision: 'Behavior' due to explicit intent + contextual plan + high imminence.

   - Explicit suicidal phrase: ""yeet myself"" (colloquial term for self-harm/suicide). 
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeframe, or past action described. 
   - Desire is expressed (""I just want to... yeet myself"") without negation or indication of being unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""Yeet myself"" is a direct slang reference to suicidal action. 
   - Strong desire implied: ""I just want to... yeet myself way too much"" shows personal intent without disclaimers. 
   - No statement rejecting the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - None. ""Yeet myself"" is vague and lacks specificity about method, tools, location, or preparations. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes current feelings/urges (""I just want to""). 
   - No mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""yeet myself"") meets criteria for **Ideation**. 
   - No plan/method/preparation (vagueness of ""yeet"" doesn’t suffice for Behavior). 
   - No past action described (rules out Attempt). 
   - Strong emotional distress and suicidal intent distinguish this from Indicator (which requires explicitly unwanted thoughts or absence of personal desire).

Crucially, it includes a reference to a past suicide attempt (""I tried to end it once before"") and a current wish related to it (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"").
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""End it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, and ""wish i succeeded"" implies a desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, self-loathing, and perceived burdensomeness are present.
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No current plan, method, or preparation is described; the only action-related content is the past attempt.
   - References to past actions: ""I tried to end it once before"" indicates a specific, self-initiated suicidal action in the past. The timeframe is unspecified but referenced in the context of current distress.
   - Imminence: No current intention or timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is mentioned; the suicidal content is historical or wishful.
   - Stated desire: ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" expresses a current desire for death, but it is tied to the past event and not accompanied by current intent to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""end it"" is a direct reference to suicide, and ""wish i succeeded"" explicitly expresses a desire for death. This is not framed as unwanted thoughts (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to""), so it indicates genuine suicidal ideation. (Yes)

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No current plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The only method-related content is vague (""end it"") and tied to the past attempt, not current behavior. (No)

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""I tried to end it once before"" clearly indicates an initiated, potentially lethal action by the author. The wish ""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"" is current but reflects on the past event, not a new action. This past attempt is mentioned in the context of current struggles, making it relevant to the 'Attempt' category regardless of when it occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post includes a clear description of a past suicide attempt (""tried to end it""), which falls under 'Attempt' by definition. The current expressions (""wish i succeeded"") indicate ongoing ideation but do not override the precedence of the stated past action. There is no current plan or behavior described, so 'Behavior' is not applicable. The suicidal desire is explicit and personal, so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. 'Attempt' takes precedence here because the author clearly describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action from their past, linked to their present state.

Final classification: 'Attempt' (based on the explicit mention of a past suicide attempt).

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I just wanna kill myself out of fear,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It also describes emotional distress (""bad panic attack,"" ""fear"") and a plea for help (""Can I please talk to someone?"").
   - Suicide/death mentions: Explicitly states ""kill myself,"" indicating personal suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Fear and panic are present, but the core expression is a desire to die.
   - Plan, method, or preparation: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase is a general expression of desire without details on how or when.
   - Temporal context: Describes current feelings (""I'm having,"" ""I just wanna""), with no reference to past actions or attempts. Imminence is implied but vague (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Stated desire: Expresses a genuine wish to die (""I just wanna kill myself""), qualified by ""out of fear,"" but there is no explicit negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") to indicate the thought is unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""I just wanna kill myself""), even if motivated by fear. Phrases like this imply personal ideation unless explicitly negated, which is not the case here.
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or something they resist (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present.
   - While the desire is strong and current, there is no indication of an intended action, plan, or even a vague method (e.g., ""make the pain physical"" isn't used). The expression ""wanna kill myself"" lacks actionable context. Thus, it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I just wanna"") with no description of past actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). It is purely about present feelings during a panic attack.
   - No initiated suicidal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression ""I just wanna kill myself"" demonstrates a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The presence of suicidal ideation with clear desire but no actionable elements fits 'Ideation'. The help-seeking (""talk to someone"") does not change the classification, as the rules focus on content.

157,"Thought I was doing better. Now my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with. Every time I am back here, I feel more and more defeated. I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with,"" which implies suicidal thoughts, though not explicitly stated. It expresses hopelessness (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle"") and despair (""feel more and more defeated""). The phrase ""why keep going?"" suggests a questioning of life's value, indicating a desire to end suffering. There are no references to specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The temporal context is current and recurring (""Every time I am back here""), with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") indicated. The writer attributes the thoughts to ""my brain,"" hinting at internal conflict but without explicit negation of the desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - The post expresses a desire to end suffering through phrases like ""just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"", which imply a wish for life to end in the context of despair. However, the framing (""my brain is screaming at me"") suggests the thoughts may be intrusive, but the writer does not explicitly state that they do not want these thoughts or will not act on them (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, there is a personal expression of suicidal desire, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation (e.g., note-writing), or intended action is mentioned. The vagueness of ""get it over with"" does not imply a concrete plan, especially without high imminence. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current thoughts and recurring feelings (""Every time I am back here"") but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""get it over with"" and ""why keep going?"") with a desire to not be alive, fitting 'Ideation'. The attribution to ""my brain"" creates some ambiguity, but the lack of explicit negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") means it does not qualify as 'Indicator'. With no plan, method, or preparation, it cannot be 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. Given the strong implication of suicidal desire without action, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

158,"Please help. I'm really annoyed at people making fun at my spiritual beliefs like crystals, astrology, tarot, ect. And it happens A LOT. They just make me feel stupid for believing in something that not many people believe in. And it's not like any of them would stop and think about what they're doing, because they think we're just 'crazy' people that they can just make fun of for their entertainment. And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions feeling annoyed and hurt by others mocking the author's spiritual beliefs, leading to feelings of stupidity and being overly sensitive. Key elements include emotional distress (feeling stupid, offended) and an explicit reference to ""suicidal thoughts"" as a current consequence of the situation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm actions, or specific plans/preparations. The suicidal thoughts are described passively (""I currently have suicidal thoughts"") without details on desire, plan, method, imminence, or past actions. No timeframe or imminent intent is indicated (e.g., ""tonight""). The primary sentiment is distress about external events and unwanted feelings, with suicidal thoughts framed as a reactive outcome rather than an endorsed desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. However, it does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The thoughts are presented as a result of distress (""one of the reasons""), but there is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to act on them""). Despite the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, the lack of personal desire or endorsement leans this toward ambiguity, but the phrasing focuses on the experience of thoughts rather than a wish for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, guns), plan, preparation (e.g., note-writing), or intended action is mentioned or implied. The reference to suicidal thoughts is vague and lacks any contextual cues of imminence or method, even when considering intent. This absence rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts but no past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no references to ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The thoughts are framed in the present (""currently have""), with no indication of initiated suicidal behavior. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" suggests potential ideation, but the context emphasizes distress about external events rather than a personal desire to die. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted, but the overall tone (seeking help, focusing on feeling offended) implies distress about the thoughts themselves. After careful consideration, there is ambiguity about personal suicidal desire: phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent, and the suicidal reference is indirect. Per the rules, if desire is ambiguous and not explicitly negated, but no plan/action exists, this falls under 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress, not a clear wish to die. The definition of 'Indicator' includes discussions of suicidal thoughts in the context of general distress when not coupled with explicit personal desire, which fits here.

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""planning to commit suicide.""  
   - Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I'll never be happy if I continue to live""), feeling trapped (""no choice but to end it""), and despair (""missing out if I stay,"" ""miserable if I stay"").  
   - Describes a genuine desire to die as a perceived necessity (""I have to go""), framed as an unavoidable outcome.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions/attempts.  
   - Imminence implied through ""planning"" but no timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""planning to commit suicide"" and ""end it.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a clear desire to die (""I have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it"") without negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Mentions ""planning to commit suicide"" but provides **no details** on method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes).  
   - ""Planning"" implies intent but lacks actionable specifics. Vagueness prevents classification as Behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""planning,"" ""have to go"").  
   - **No description** of past initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Ideation**: Fits because of clear suicidal desire (""planning to commit suicide,"" ""end it"") but **no plan/method/preparation details**.  
   - **Behavior**: Not applicable—despite ""planning,"" no method/action is specified.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no past/recent initiated lethal action described.  
   - *Key nuance*: ""Planning"" alone is insufficient for Behavior without concrete method/preparation. Ambiguity leans toward Ideation.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice: once as a choice avoided (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"") and once describing being ""so close to attempting suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: regret, embarrassment, dread, feeling ""not mentally stable,"" nausea, and distress about living with family.
   - References a past near-attempt: ""I was so close to attempting suicide"" that was interrupted by texting the mother (""in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom"").
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline for future suicide is mentioned. The focus is on the *avoidance* of an attempt by choosing to move home.
   - The desire to die is implied (""going through with attempting suicide"") but framed as averted. The phrase ""I do not like living with them"" expresses distress, not an explicit wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""attempting suicide"" is explicitly mentioned.
   - However, the context shows the author *avoided* acting on this desire by choosing to move home. The suicidal urge is described in the past tense (""was so close"") as averted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations for suicide are described.
   - The only ""action"" mentioned is texting the mother to confess struggles, which was a *protective* action that prevented an attempt.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a past near-attempt (""so close to attempting suicide"") that was interrupted by reaching out (""dumped everything on my mom"").
   - No actual self-initiated, potentially lethal action occurred. The phrase ""so close"" implies intent but no initiation of action (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm). The text intervention stopped progression to an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit suicidal intent (""attempting suicide"") is present but framed as averted. No plan/method/preparation is described.
   - The key phrase ""so close to attempting suicide"" suggests strong ideation with imminent risk, but crucially, **no action was initiated**. The interruption (texting mom) distinguishes this from an 'Attempt'.
   - Since there is no description of a specific plan or preparatory steps for future suicide, it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.
   - Strong suicidal desire in the past warrants 'Ideation'. The current distress focuses on shame/regret, but the core suicidal expression (past, intense, and explicit) aligns with Ideation.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" but immediately negates it with ""I wont kill myself of course."" This indicates the author is referencing suicidal thoughts but explicitly stating they do not intend to act on them.
   - Emotional indicators are present: intense pain (""excruciating""), distress (""I cant take it""), and a desire to express anger (""want to scream and break everything""), but these are directed outward, not inward toward self-harm or suicide.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are mentioned. The phrase ""break everything"" refers to destructive impulses but not self-destructive behavior.
   - The timeframe is current, focusing on immediate emotional pain, with no imminence of suicidal action indicated.
   - The author's desire is clear: they explicitly reject suicide (""of course"") while expressing distress about their emotional state. The suicidal thought is framed as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" but it is directly negated (""I wont kill myself of course""). This shows the thought is present but not desired.
   - There is no expression of a genuine wish to die or for life to end; instead, the focus is on the pain causing frustration.
   - The suicidal thought is explicitly stated as unwanted, as the author emphasizes they will not act on it. This strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The reference to ""break everything"" is aggressive but not suicidal; it lacks any connection to self-harm or a specific suicidal means.
   - With no explicit desire to die and no indication of planning or action, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings only, with no mention of past suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-initiated lethal behavior). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key factor is the explicit negation of suicidal intent (""I wont kill myself of course"") combined with expressions of distress. This fits the 'Indicator' category, as it involves general distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts without a personal desire to die.
   - Phrases like ""I cant take it"" and ""pain makes me want to scream"" convey hopelessness but, in context, are not expressions of suicidal ideation because the author actively disavows suicide. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. The unwanted nature of the suicidal thought confirms 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post focuses on gender dysphoria, distress about appearance obsession, and a desire to be male. Key elements include: ""I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing,"" and ""I want to be a male now."" 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress and discomfort (e.g., ""hate"" and ""wish"" statements), but these relate to gender identity and societal pressures, not hopelessness, despair, or being a burden in a suicidal context. 
   - No references to past suicidal actions, plans, methods, preparations, or imminence (e.g., no timeframes like ""tonight"" or ""soon""). 
   - The writer's stated desire is to transition genders (""I want to be a male now""), not a wish to die or for life to end. There is no expression of suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to be gone"" or ""I hate living""). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no discussion of them being unwanted. 
   - The primary sentiment is distress about gender dysphoria and appearance, not suicidal ideation. Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of any method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide or self-harm. 
   - Since there is no suicidal intent from Step 2, this step is not applicable. No behavior indicators present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (e.g., ""now""), not past events. 
   - No description of any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (gender dysphoria, appearance obsession) but lacks any personal, explicit expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, or intent. Phrases like ""I hate wearing makeup"" are specific to gender expression, not a broader wish to die. 
   - There is no evidence of suicidal ideation (which would require expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""life isn't worth it""), no behavior (plan/method/action), and no attempt (past initiated action). 
   - The distress is clearly about identity and societal pressures, falling under 'Indicator' as it discusses struggles without suicidal elements. 
   - No ambiguity: Suicidal desire is absent, and the content aligns with the 'Indicator' definition of general distress without personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses self-hatred (""hate myself""), loathing of existence (""loathe my existence""), and a wish for suicide (""wish I had the courage to end it all""). However, it also includes strong counter-statements emphasizing endurance (""I just want the courage to endure it all""), encouragement to others to stay alive (""Stay around to see these days""), and supportive messages (""you are loved,"" ""I'm here""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. No past suicidal actions are described, and no timeframe or imminence is indicated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The emotional tone includes hopelessness but is balanced by resilience and a focus on community support.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""end it all"" is a euphemism for suicide, expressing a desire to die. However, the writer explicitly negates this desire by stating they want ""the courage to endure it all,"" indicating that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and not something they wish to act on. The overall context shows distress about suicidal thoughts rather than a genuine personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or plan is mentioned. ""End it all"" is vague and not tied to any actionable steps. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). With no imminence or intent to act, this does not indicate behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). All content is present-tense and reflective, not descriptive of initiated actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of suicidal thoughts (""end it all"") and expressions like ""loathe my existence"" could initially suggest ideation. However, the explicit statement of wanting to endure and the focus on supporting others show the thoughts are unwanted and not representative of a current desire to die. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress about suicidal thoughts when they are explicitly negated or unwanted. There is no plan or method (ruling out 'Behavior'), and no past action (ruling out 'Attempt'). The ambiguity in desire is resolved by the writer's clear negation and emphasis on endurance.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""almost committed suicide a few days ago"" – explicit reference to a past suicidal action initiated by the author.
   - States ""i still consider"" – indicates ongoing suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: severe anxiety, hopelessness (e.g., ""sick of my family,"" ""no friends,"" isolation on birthday).
   - No specific method/preparation details for future intent beyond ""consider"" (vague). The past event lacked means (""didn't have anything to do it with"").
   - Past action timeframe: ""a few days ago"" (very recent).
   - Desire to die is implied in ""almost committed suicide"" and ""still consider,"" but not explicitly negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Explicitly mentions ""almost committed suicide"" (direct phrase) and ""still consider"" (ongoing thoughts). No negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Past event: No specific method mentioned (only lack of means). Current ideation (""still consider"") lacks any plan/method/preparation details.
   - No indications of future preparations or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a **past self-initiated action**: ""almost committed suicide a few days ago."" This qualifies as an *initiated potentially lethal action* (attempt interrupted by lack of means).
   - Timeframe (""a few days ago"") is recent and explicitly linked to current struggles.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core event is a described **past suicide attempt** (""almost committed""). The rules state: 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described, regardless of when it happened. 
   - Current ""consider[ation]"" (ideation) is noted but lacks plan/method, so it wouldn't override 'Attempt'. 
   - No plan/method for future intent rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - Explicit past action rules out 'Indicator'/'Ideation'.

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct mentions of suicide: ""suicide with me,"" ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" and ""for those want to suicide too."" This indicates a personal desire to engage in suicide and an invitation for others to join.
   - Emotional indicators: The language implies hopelessness and isolation, but no specific emotions like despair or burden are detailed. The focus is on collaborative action.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The act of suicide is referenced generally without details on how, when, or where.
   - References to past actions: None. The post is future-oriented, proposing joint suicide.
   - Imminence: No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is stated, though the invitation (""with me"") suggests current intent.
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a personal desire to die through phrases like ""suicide with me,"" with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated. The invitation reinforces a genuine wish to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" multiple times in a personal context (e.g., ""suicide with me"").
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die, as the author is actively seeking companionship for the act.
   - No, suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are endorsed and promoted.
   - Conclusion: Explicit suicidal intent is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - The phrase ""suicide with me"" implies an intended action but is vague and lacks concrete details about how the suicide would occur. While intent is high, the absence of any plan, method, or preparatory step means this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.
   - Despite the invitation (which could indicate imminence), the vagueness and lack of specificity mean genuine uncertainty exists about a plan or method. Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""suicide with me"") with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - No initiated suicidal action (e.g., past attempt) is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Ruled out 'Indicator' due to explicit personal desire to die.
   - Ruled out 'Attempt' as no past or recent initiated action is mentioned.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The post expresses a strong desire to die and an intention to act (inviting others), but it lacks any mention of a plan, method, or preparation. The vagueness of the reference to action, coupled with no high imminence (e.g., specific timing), means it fits 'Ideation'. Per the rules, if uncertain about plan/method after considering context, choose 'Ideation'.

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kms [kill myself]"", ""I really want to hang myself right now"", ""I can't stop thinking about killing myself"", ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"".  
   - Emotional indicators: ""I am a burden"", ""scared of failing"", ""can't focus on anything except trying again"", hopelessness (""It is what I deserve"").  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself"" (rope mentioned).  
   - Preparations: ""practice hung"" (simulated hanging), references to desired but incomplete logistical prep (packing, resigning).  
   - Past/recent action: Describes physically putting a rope around their neck and simulating hanging (""practice hung"") within the same timeframe (""just got home from work"").  
   - Imminence: ""right now"", ""can't wait any longer"", ""trying again"" (imminent intent).  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""want to kms"", ""want to hang myself""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""kill myself"", ""hang myself"", ""killing myself"". Clear desire expressed without negation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific method: hanging (with rope).  
   - **Yes**. Preparations: Acquired means (rope), simulated action (""practice hung""), logistical plans (packing/resigning, though incomplete).  
   - Imminence (""right now"") and intent (""can't stop thinking,"" ""trying again"") reinforce behavioral risk.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past/recent self-initiated action**: ""I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two"" (initiated a potentially lethal action but stopped).  
   - Timeframe: Very recent (""just got home from work,"" ""sitting here now"").  
   - This is a concrete, potentially lethal action by the author, meeting the 'Attempt' threshold.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** is the strongest category: The author describes a recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (simulated hanging with a rope). This takes precedence over concurrent ideation (""can't stop thinking about killing myself"") or behavioral planning (""want to hang myself right now"").  
   - Rules clarification: ""Practice hung"" qualifies as an initiated suicidal action (interrupted by self). Historical attempts would also fit, but here the action is immediate/recent.  
   - Despite fear of failure and incomplete logistical prep, the physical act of using the rope elevates this beyond 'Behavior'.

167,"I'm finally doing it. I think I'm finally going to actually do it. I've been sobbing for the last few hours. I think I'm finally ready to do it. I finally got confirmation that my fiancé doesn't really care. It's finally fucking time. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead. Then he will survive, then he won't need to work out a way to keep two people afloat with only his job. He'll only need to focus on himself and I'll finally be at peace. I told him today. I told him this job was making me suicidal and I couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe. He sounded disappointed. He asked if he should talk to his boss and I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden so I said no but fuck, it's so fucking obvious I needed him today and he didn't even fucking care. My mom only cares about what I fail at, she never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation. She only gave a shit because I couldn't hold a job. I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I think I'm finally ready to do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore.""
   - Mentions a method: ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun"" (though expresses uncertainty: ""I don't know how exactly"").
   - High imminence: ""finally doing it,"" ""it's finally fucking time,"" ""I think I know that I'm going to go through with it.""
   - Emotional distress: Sobbing, feeling overwhelmed, failure, burden, hopelessness.
   - References job causing ""violently suicidal"" feelings and past suicidal ideation (mother ""never really understood my depression or my suicidal ideation"").
   - No past actions (e.g., initiated attempts) described—only current/future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""doing it"" (contextually meaning suicide), ""violently suicidal,"" and explicit desire: ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here anymore."" No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. A method is mentioned (""get a gun""), even if uncertain. Combined with high imminence (""finally time"") and intent (""going through with it""), this constitutes a plan/intended action. Preparations aren’t described, but the method reference suffices for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""going to do it""). No description of past initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried""). Mentions historical ideation but no past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (→ not 'Indicator').  
   - Method mentioned (gun) + high imminence/intent → 'Behavior' (not 'Ideation').  
   - No past initiated lethal action → not 'Attempt'.  
   - Uncertainty about method (""don’t know how exactly"") is overridden by stated intent and method reference.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions driving to the mountains ""with full intentions to end things,"" indicating a specific suicidal intention and location (mountains).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""people in my life are apathetic""), despair (""sleep and be numb""), and ambivalence (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").  
   - Describes a recent, impulsive action: driving to the mountains to end their life.  
   - Expresses desire to avoid feelings but does not negate the suicidal desire entirely; instead, states reluctance to act *now* (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").  
   - References magical thinking about rescue (""maybe someone will call me""), showing internal conflict.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit intent: ""end things"" is a direct euphemism for suicide. Desire is clear (""full intentions to end things"").  
   - No explicit negation of the suicidal desire itself (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"" is absent). The reluctance is about acting *now* (""I don’t think I’m going to do it""), not a rejection of the desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific plan: Traveling to the mountains with suicidal intent.  
   - Location: Mountains (implied method, e.g., jumping).  
   - Imminence: Recent action (""just finished driving"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a past action: The author *initiated* a potentially lethal act by driving to the mountains to end their life.  
   - The action was interrupted (self-stopped: ""I don’t think I’m going to do it""), making it an aborted attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire + initiated action = **Attempt**.  
   - The author describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (driving to the mountains to die) that was interrupted. Temporal recency (""just finished"") and context (linking to current distress) support this.  
   - Rules: ""Attempt"" includes interrupted/aborted actions. Historical context is irrelevant if the author describes the action.  
   - *Not Ideation/Behavior*: A concrete action was taken, not just a plan.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit personal desire to die and initiated action are present.

169,"I'm ready to die :). The date was set a while ago. I even changed it, but nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life. I'm ready. Preps being made for me to go out the way I want. I'm strapped in and ready to go. Fuck this world.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""go out"" (a euphemism for dying) indicate a personal desire for death. ""Fuck this world"" expresses despair and hopelessness.
   - Emotional indicators: ""nothing in my life is changing"" and ""projection for a fulfilling life"" show hopelessness and anhedonia.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""The date was set a while ago"" implies a specific timeline. ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" explicitly states preparations are underway. ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" suggests readiness for action, potentially hinting at a method (e.g., vehicular or other means), though the method is not explicitly detailed.
   - References to past actions: ""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it"" refers to past planning but not a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no description of an attempt).
   - Imminence: ""I'm ready"" and ""ready to go"" convey high imminence, indicating the event could happen soon.
   - Stated desire: ""I'm ready to die"" expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""ready to die"" and ""go out"" are explicit euphemisms for death/suicide, showing a clear desire to die. There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to""), so this is not 'Indicator'. Instead, it aligns with 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is not named, but ""go out the way I want"" and ""strapped in"" imply a chosen method, and ""preps being made"" confirms active preparations. Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence (""ready to go""), these vague references to action and preparation, in context, indicate a plan or intended behavior. This supports classification as 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses past planning (""date was set a while ago"") and current/future intentions (""ready to die,"" ""preps being made,"" ""ready to go""). There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt like taking pills or jumping). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply, as no action was initiated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm ready to die"") rules out 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity or unwanted nature to the thoughts.
   - The presence of a plan (date set) and preparations (""preps being made"") moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method) to 'Behavior'.
   - No past initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Despite the method being somewhat vague, the high imminence and concrete preparations confirm 'Behavior'. Doubt between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior' is resolved by the explicit preparations and readiness stated.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""i hate my course,"" ""i dont have much choices""), despair over social isolation (""My 'friends' have all pretty much ditched me""), and references to depression and OCD affecting life.
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - Past events are discussed (e.g., academic struggles, OCD since 2017, depression, being kicked out of school), but there are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Imminence is not indicated; the phrase ""thinking of"" suggests contemplation without a timeframe like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
   - The desire to die is expressed (""ending my life"") without any statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""ending my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""Im thinking of ending my life"").
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to act on them; the expression is personal and affirmative.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or plan is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are present.
   - Although suicidal intent is explicit, the lack of any method, plan, or action—coupled with no high imminence—means this does not rise to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past life events (e.g., academic failures, mental health struggles) but no past suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"" suicide).
   - Current suicidal thoughts are expressed (""Im thinking of ending my life""), but no initiated action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""ending my life"") rules out 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about suicidal intent or expression of unwanted thoughts.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The core content is the expression of suicidal thoughts with desire but without actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: 
     - ""its working!"" suggests that some action or process is currently in effect, which could imply initiation of a suicidal method (e.g., ingesting substances) but is vague.
     - ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" indicates a farewell or preparation, implying the author does not expect to post again, possibly due to impending death.
     - ""pls let me never wake up"" is a direct plea to not regain consciousness, expressing a clear desire to die (e.g., by not surviving sleep). This shows despair, hopelessness, and a wish for life to end.
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""never wake up"" implies death or permanent unconsciousness.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""hopefully this is my last post"") and despair (""pls let me never wake up"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""its working!"" may vaguely imply a method in progress (e.g., overdose), but no explicit tools, locations, or substances are named. ""Last post"" could indicate farewell preparation.
   - References to past actions: None; the context is current/future-oriented.
   - Imminence: High, as ""never wake up"" suggests something happening imminently (e.g., during sleep).
   - Stated desire: The plea ""pls let me never wake up"" expresses a genuine wish to die, not unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""pls let me never wake up"" clearly conveys a personal desire to die or for life to end in a context of despair. It is not negated as unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit death intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is not named, but ""never wake up"" strongly implies a method like overdose or asphyxiation associated with sleep.
   - ""its working!"" suggests an action may be in progress or initiated, implying preparation or execution, though vague.
   - ""hopefully this is my last post"" indicates preparation (e.g., farewell).
   - Given explicit desire to die and high imminence (""never wake up"" implying immediate risk), the vague reference to action (""its working!"") in context implies an intended suicidal behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current/future intentions with high imminence (e.g., ""never wake up"" suggests the night or sleep is imminent).
   - No past actions are described (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt); the focus is on prospective behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - There is explicit desire to die (""pls let me never wake up""), ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire).
   - The presence of implied action (""its working!"") and preparation (""last post""), coupled with high imminence and intent, moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method/action).
   - This fits 'Behavior': Explicit suicidal desire with indications of intended action (vague method implied by ""never wake up"" and ""its working!"") and preparation (""last post"" as farewell).
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated lethal action is described (e.g., no statement like ""I took pills"" or ""I tried"").
   - Imminence and context resolve vagueness: Leaning to 'Behavior' due to high intent and implied action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions possession of pills (antidepressants and allergy medicine) and describes them as easy to swallow.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""antidepressants didn't work haha"") and readiness to die (""im so ready to die"").
   - References past expressions of intent without action (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") but emphasizes current capability (""this time i actually have the means"").
   - States a specific plan with high imminence (""tonight im gonna do it"").
   - Explicitly desires death (""im so ready to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Phrases like ""im gonna do it"" and ""im so ready to die"" directly express a personal desire for death. There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes: A method (overdosing on pills) is specified. The user details having two types of pills and notes their ease of swallowing. Preparation is confirmed (""i actually have the means""). Imminence is high (""tonight"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on a future intention (""tonight im gonna do it""). Past behavior (""never do"") is mentioned but describes inaction, not a prior attempt. No initiated lethal action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation threshold met) + specific method (pills) + preparations (possession) + imminent intent (""tonight"") = **Behavior**. Past non-action does not override current plan/method evidence. No description of a past initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Key elements: Expressions of hopelessness (""I want to be done,"" ""tired and alone,"" ""unwanted nuisance""), loneliness, and lack of belonging. Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" as a perceived solution to end suffering. No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions described. The phrase ""kill myself"" is direct, but framed as a hypothetical outcome (""the only way... would be to""). Emotional distress is central, with no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Strong desire implied (""I want to be done with everything,"" ""only way... would be to kill myself""). No explicit rejection of these thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **No**: No mention of methods, tools, locations, preparations, or imminent actions. The reference to suicide is abstract (""the only way... would be"") without actionable intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Focuses on *current* feelings and hypothetical future actions (""would be to kill myself""). No description of past/ongoing suicidal actions (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** (vague hypothetical framing lacks immediacy or specificity) rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/recent self-initiated lethal actions** rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Despair is present, but suicidal intent is *personal and explicit*, disqualifying 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post uses phrases like ""I really want to check out"" and ""me unexpectedly checking out,"" which are euphemisms for suicide or death. It explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of having no moral problem with it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""spite has its limits"") and a lack of concern for others' reactions, indicating despair and a burden-like feeling. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or locations. No past actions or attempts are described; the references are to current feelings and the sustaining role of spite. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the timeframe is vague (""at this point""). The writer expresses a strong desire to die (e.g., ""I really want to check out"") without stating these thoughts as unwanted or negating the desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and uses ""check out"" as a clear euphemism for suicide/death.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out"") in a context of despair.
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; instead, spite is presented as the only barrier, implying the desire is genuine.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means).
   - Despite high desire, there is no reference to intended action, even vague (e.g., ""do something""), and no imminence to suggest an immediate plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current intentions and feelings, not past events. There is no description of a past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die, falling under 'Ideation'. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The lack of past initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'. The desire is not framed as unwanted distress (e.g., no ""I don't want these thoughts""), so it is not 'Indicator'. Phrases like ""I hate living"" are not used, but ""I want to check out"" conveys similar ideation. Ambiguity is low after analysis; the core is desire without actionable elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense emotional pain (""im in so much pain""), hopelessness (""i cant do this anymore,"" ""i cant handle it anymore""), and explicit intent to act (""im going to do it"").  
   - ""im going to do it"" strongly implies a personal intention to commit suicide, with ""it"" contextually referring to ending life.  
   - ""im done"" and farewell (""thank you to the people... hope everyone finds something to live for"") suggest closure/preparations.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, but the phrasing implies imminent action.  
   - No past actions described (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""im going to do it"" expresses a clear, current desire to act, coupled with despair (""i cant handle it anymore""). No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) is stated. However, ""im going to do it"" implies an intended action, and the farewell (""thank you... hope everyone"") signals preparations (e.g., saying goodbye). Given high imminence (implied by urgency) and explicit intent, this leans toward Behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""im going to do it""), not past actions. No description of an initiated attempt (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to act (""im going to do it"") and no indication thoughts are unwanted.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Expresses intent to act (""do it"") and preparations (farewell), moving beyond passive desire.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No past/recent self-initiated lethal action described.  
   - **Behavior**: Strong intent + implied action (""do it"") + preparatory farewell, despite no specific method. High imminence/intent justifies Behavior over Ideation.

176,What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?. I know that's it's stupid but I've got a lot of stress right now and it would just be a lot easier. I've also never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly asks for ""a mostly painless way to kill myself,"" directly mentioning suicide and seeking a method.  
   - Emotional indicators include high stress (""a lot of stress right now""), hopelessness (""never really seen myself going anywhere in life""), and a perceived lack of alternatives (""it would just be a lot easier"").  
   - The phrase ""why not"" implies resignation and a genuine desire to act.  
   - No explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to die"").  
   - No mention of specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means) or past actions.  
   - Imminence is not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the urgency is implied in the context of current stress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" a direct suicidal phrase.  
   - **Yes**, it expresses a clear desire to die as a solution to stress and hopelessness (e.g., ""it would just be a lot easier"").  
   - No indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the tone is resigned/accepting.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The query about a ""mostly painless way"" implies an interest in methods but does not specify a concrete plan, tool, location, or preparation.  
   - No evidence of active preparations (e.g., ""I have pills"" or ""going to the bridge"").  
   - While method-seeking indicates progression beyond passive ideation, the vagueness and lack of concrete details (e.g., no named method) lean toward *Ideation*.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses current/future intentions (""why not"") but describes **no past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no mention of attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** is present (ruling out *Indicator*).  
   - **No specific plan, method, or preparation** is detailed (ruling out *Behavior*). Asking ""what is a way"" shows method-seeking but falls short of describing an *intended* action or plan.  
   - **No past initiated lethal action** is described (ruling out *Attempt*).  
   - The core is **suicidal ideation with a desire to die and method curiosity** but without actionable steps. Thus, *Ideation* best fits.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post focuses on describing the painful and non-peaceful nature of dying by overdose, specifically warning against taking pills for suicide.  
   - It mentions suicide methods (overdosing) and consequences (vomiting, liver damage, death), but **these are presented as general information, not personal expressions or plans**.  
   - Emotional tone is cautionary/educational (e.g., ""Don’t take the pills,"" ""It is one of the worst things,"" ""permanent liver damage"").  
   - **No personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, preparations, or past actions by the author is expressed**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent** (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I plan to overdose"").  
   - Suicide is discussed abstractly as a general concept (e.g., ""if you do end it with pills""). The author distances themselves from the act (e.g., ""I’m not here to tell you not to commit suicide"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (overdosing) and consequences are described, but **not in the context of the author’s own plans or preparations**.  
   - No indication the author has a plan, method, or intent to act.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No description of past or current personal suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried,"" ""I took pills"").  
   - References to overdose are hypothetical/educational (e.g., ""let’s say you do end it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly to warn others, with **no personal expression of desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or past attempt by the author**.  
   - Strongly aligns with **Indicator**: General distress about suicide (as a societal issue) and educational content, lacking personal suicidal intent. Phrases like ""Don’t take the pills"" reinforce a preventive stance, not self-risk.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: ""im positive im gonna do it"" (future suicide intent), ""i truly have no motivation to keep on living"" (hopelessness), ""ill do it when im fed up of this"" (conditional plan), ""dont worry, im good rn"" (reassurance of no immediate action).  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""gonna do it"" implies suicide without direct terms like ""suicide,"" but context confirms intent.  
   - Desire to die: Clear (""no motivation to keep on living""), not negated as unwanted.  
   - Plan/method: Vague future timing (""when im fed up""), no specific method, tools, location, or preparations.  
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up""), no past actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Gonna do it"" implies suicidal action, and ""no motivation to keep on living"" expresses a desire for life to end. No negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No. The conditional ""when im fed up"" lacks specificity (method, tools, location, or preparations). Intent is deferred, not imminent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past actions. Focus is on future intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) is present, but no plan/method/preparation.  
   - Vague timing (""future,"" ""when im fed up"") lacks imminence or actionable details, ruling out Behavior.  
   - No past initiated action (Attempt).  
   - Strong desire (""no motivation to keep on living"") and intent (""gonna do it"") confirm Ideation, not Indicator.

179,I fucking hate my parents for having me. They literally just wanted a baby because 'that's part of life' and it's just resulted in a human being (me) living a life psychologically tortured. They could even find the time to care for me.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger and resentment towards the parents for bringing the author into existence (""I fucking hate my parents for having me""). It describes feeling ""psychologically tortured"" and uncared for. Key elements include:
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""living a life psychologically tortured""), feeling neglected (""They could even find the time to care for me"").
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The focus is on suffering and blame toward parents, not personal suicidal desire or action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents.
   - **No expressions** of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent; the closest is frustration about existence being ""psychologically tortured,"" which conveys distress but not active death wishes).
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, so there is no context to assess whether they are unwanted.  
   → **Conclusion**: No evidence of personal suicidal desire. Leans toward *Indicator*.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No references** to methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or vague actionable intent (e.g., ""make this pain physical"").  
   → Not applicable. Supports *Indicator* or *Ideation* only if desire were present (which it is not).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes **ongoing suffering**, not past/future actions. **No mention** of prior suicide attempts, self-harm, or preparatory behaviors.  
   → Rules out *Behavior* and *Attempt*.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows **severe distress and hopelessness** but lacks:
     - Explicit/unwanted suicidal thoughts (required for *Indicator* with distress).
     - Personal desire to die (required for *Ideation*).
     - Plan/method/action (required for *Behavior*).
     - Past initiated lethal action (required for *Attempt*).
   - While phrases like ""psychologically tortured"" imply despair, they **do not cross into personal suicidal desire or intent**. The core is anger at parents and existential pain, falling under generalized distress.  
   → **Best fit: *Indicator*** (expresses distress without suicidal intent).

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes a vivid, violent nightmare about mass murder and the resulting intense fear, panic, and anxiety upon waking. Key elements include:  
   - No mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm related to the author.  
   - Emotional indicators: Severe panic, terror, anxiety about sleep, distress about the dream's intensity.  
   - No references to personal suicidal plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or desire to die.  
   - Focus is on interpreting the dream and coping with its aftermath (e.g., ""how to deal with it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar.  
   - **No expressions of desire to die**, end life, or hopelessness about existence (e.g., no ""I hate living"").  
   - Author seeks solutions to *reduce anxiety*, indicating distress is unwanted but unrelated to suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No references** to suicidal methods, tools, locations, preparations, or intended actions. Content is entirely dream-focused.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a dream and its emotional impact. **No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses **general distress** (panic, fear, sleep anxiety) without personal suicidal desire, plan, or action.  
   - Lacks suicidal intent; focuses on coping with nightmares. Fits **Indicator** (distress without personal suicidal expression).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""end this suffering"" implying a desire to cease existence.
   - Explicitly references past suicidal actions: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" (specifies a self-initiated overdose with intent).
   - Expresses despair (""all i saw was fear and despair"") and a plea for strength to act (""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"").
   - ""so i can do it"" suggests suicidal intent, but method/plan for future action is vague.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: ""end this suffering"" and ""so i can do it"" imply a current desire to die, reinforced by the context of past suicide attempts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific future plan, method, or preparation described (e.g., no mention of tools, timeline, or active steps for a new attempt). The phrase ""do it"" is too vague to constitute a plan without further context.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **Past action confirmed**: The author explicitly describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""overdosed... once on purpose."" This qualifies as a past suicide attempt regardless of timeframe.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post meets the criteria for **'Attempt'** because it describes a past suicidal action initiated by the author (""overdosed... on purpose""). This takes precedence over current expressions of ideation (""end this suffering"") or vague future intent (""so i can do it"") under the rules. The mention of this attempt in the context of current suffering solidifies it as the primary classifier.

182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: Explicit mention of ""I'm suicidal again"" indicates current personal suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include distress over low mood, fear of burdening partner (""hurting my significant other,"" ""scared to stress him""), and hopelessness linked to medication access issues (""run out of meds,"" ""urgent refill not addressed""). No mention of death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Timeframe is current (""all of a sudden,"" ""again"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**: ""I'm suicidal again"" is an explicit, personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire. No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"") is present. Phrases like ""suicidal"" inherently convey desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No**: No reference to methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (note, acquiring means), or intended actions. Medication mention relates to treatment lapse, not a suicide plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - **No past/future action**: Describes current ideation (""suicidal again"") and distress, but no description of initiated self-harm (e.g., ""tried to overdose"") or imminent plans (""tonight"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (""suicidal"") without negation → Rules out *Indicator*.
    - No method, plan, preparation, or stated intention to act → Rules out *Behavior*.
    - No description of past/current self-initiated lethal actions → Rules out *Attempt*.
    - Clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts/desire with no actionable elements → **Ideation**.

It's just too hard.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""I want to die more than ever.""
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I can't have this life it's too painful""), worthlessness (""she thinks I'm worthless""), despair (""Everytime I try I fail""), and anxiety.
   - Plans/methods/preparations: No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. No references to past actions or attempts.
   - Imminence: No timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for acting on thoughts.
   - Desire: Explicitly expresses a personal wish to die (""I want to die more than ever"") without negation or indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I want to die more than ever"" is a clear, current, personal expression of desire for life to end.  
   - The statement is not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it""). Strongly implies genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, acquiring means), or vague action plans.  
   - No implied plan even with high emotional distress (e.g., ""make this pain physical"" is absent).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Focuses on current emotional state (""now I want to die"").  
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation (ruling out **Behavior**).  
   - No past/current initiated lethal action (ruling out **Attempt**).  
   - Not **Indicator** because suicidal desire is personal, explicit, and not negated. Phrases like ""I can't have this life"" and ""I want to die"" are clear ideation signals.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" as a specific method and asks about the experience, indicating concern about the method.
   - It includes preparation: ""ive alr tied the noose"" (I have already tied the noose), which is a direct step toward carrying out the method.
   - The user expresses uncertainty (""im still not sure""), but this does not negate the preparatory action.
   - There is no explicit emotional language like hopelessness or burden, but the context implies distress related to suicide.
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the focus is on current preparation and inquiry about the method.
   - Imminence is suggested by the completed preparation (noose tied), though uncertainty may delay action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in ""suicide by hanging,"" directly referring to self-inflicted death.
   - It implies a desire to die through the preparatory action (tying the noose), even with stated uncertainty. Phrases like ""im still not sure"" indicate ambivalence but not an explicit negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not described as unwanted; instead, the user is seeking information to inform a potential action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""suicide by hanging.""
   - Preparation is explicitly stated: ""ive alr tied the noose,"" which is a clear, actionable step toward carrying out the method.
   - The context shows high intent and imminence due to the preparation, despite uncertainty. The question about pain suggests the user is evaluating the method for potential use.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current preparation (tying the noose) but no past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no description of an actual attempt like ""I tried to hang myself"").
   - The action is preparatory, not an attempt, as tying a noose is setting up the means but not initiating the lethal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is explicit personal suicidal intent (mention of ""suicide"" and preparation) and no indication that thoughts are unwanted.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because, while there is a desire implied, there is also specific method mention and concrete preparation (tying the noose), moving beyond thoughts alone.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated lethal action is described; tying the noose is preparation, not an attempt (which would involve starting the act, e.g., ""I put the noose around my neck"").
   - This fits 'Behavior': The post expresses suicidal thoughts/desire (implied by the context) and includes specific method (hanging) and preparation (noose tied), satisfying the criteria for ""preparations being taken.""

185,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of suicide (""kill myself"") and a clear desire to die (""I want to die because of them""). It expresses emotional distress related to unwanted sexual feelings (e.g., ""I'm a pervert,"" ""I can't help my sexual feelings""), but the suicidal intent is personal and explicit. There is no mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The language is contemplative (""Should I kill myself?"") and expresses a current desire to die, but without imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"") or action-oriented details.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die,"" indicating a clear, personal desire to end life. There is no negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""), so the thoughts are not framed as unwanted. Phrases like ""I want to die"" strongly imply genuine suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, guns), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. The post focuses on desire and internal conflict, not actionable steps. The question ""Should I kill myself?"" suggests uncertainty, not intent to act imminently. With no plan or method implied, this does not meet the threshold for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Therefore, Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (""I want to die"") and suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""), placing it beyond Indicator (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as Behavior. With no description of past initiated actions, Attempt is ruled out. Thus, the best fit is Ideation, as it captures suicidal thoughts and desire without actionable elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense anger and hatred towards the father and family, references past sexual assault trauma, and includes the phrase ""i just wanna end it."" There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past suicidal actions. The emotional indicators include despair (""i hate everything"") and a stated desire to ""end it,"" which implies a wish for life to end. No timeframe or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" explicitly expresses a personal desire to end life, similar to ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living."" It is not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so it indicates genuine suicidal ideation. No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used, but ""end it"" in this context clearly conveys intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is vague and lacks any detail about how or when it might be carried out. There is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""now"" or ""soon"") that would elevate it to behavior. Without concrete evidence of planning or action, this remains ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and past trauma but does not describe any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts). The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" is a present/future-oriented expression of desire, not a report of an action taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to ""end it"" confirms suicidal ideation (falling under 'Ideation' as defined). There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The thoughts are not stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""), so it does not qualify as 'Indicator'. No past attempt is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The strong emotional context supports 'Ideation' as the primary category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post discusses feeling unable to cope in the past and mentions being ""on the brink of suicide"" in those moments.  
   - The author describes choosing to ""go vagrant"" (homelessness) as an alternative to suicide during those crises, framing it as a coping strategy.  
   - There are no explicit expressions of *current* desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or preparations.  
   - References to suicide are historical (""on the brink of suicide"" in past occasions) and contextualized as averted through alternative actions (becoming homeless).  
   - The tone focuses on resilience and a backup plan (""the road has saved me,"" ""it’s a comfort to know it’s there"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No explicit *current* personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - Mentions of suicide are:

     - Historical (""I felt like I couldn’t cope"" in past scenarios).  
     - Framed as *avoided* through alternative action (choosing homelessness).  
   - **Conclusion:** No current personal suicidal intent expressed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, or preparations for suicide.  
   - The only ""plan"" discussed is homelessness as an *alternative* to suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - All suicidal context is explicitly in the past (""there have been more than a few occasions,"" ""on two of those occasions"").  
   - No description of past self-initiated suicidal *actions* (e.g., attempts). Only avoidance via homelessness.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses distress and references suicidal feelings **abstractly/historically**, but lacks:  
     - Current personal desire to die.  
     - Explicit unwanted suicidal thoughts (it focuses on past coping).  
   - Phrases like ""on the brink of suicide"" describe past vulnerability but are not personal *current* expressions of ideation.  
   - Homelessness is presented as a *distress management strategy*, not a suicidal behavior.  
   - **Fit for Indicator:** Discusses suicide as a risk others might face and frames past distress without endorsing active desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions emotional distress: ""life has been getting worse,"" ""addiction for years,"" ""drunk,"" ""so lonely,"" ""can't go on anymore,"" ""fucked up my life,"" ""miss being happy.""
    - Explicit suicidal intent: ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, indicating a desire for life to end.
    - Plan/Imminence: States ""tonight"" as the timeframe for action (""tonight I'm just gonna... end it"").
    - Preparations: Mentions being drunk (potentially lowering inhibition) and isolating in the basement (suitable location). Includes a farewell (""I love you all so much"").
    - No explicit reference to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes. ""End it"" directly implies suicide, and phrases like ""can't go on anymore"" express a desire for life to end. No negation of these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Method is vague (""end it""), but intent is explicit. 
    - Preparations: Being drunk (potentially to facilitate the act) and isolating in the basement (implied location). 
    - High imminence (""tonight"") couples with intent to act. Farewell message suggests finality.  
    → Leans toward 'Behavior' due to stated action plan + imminence.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Focuses on future intention (""tonight I'm gonna...""). No description of past initiated suicidal actions.  
    → Rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die (""end it"") exists without negation.  
    - **Not 'Ideation'**: Desire is present, but the post includes a timeframe (""tonight""), preparations (isolation, intoxication), and implied action plan.  
    - **Not 'Attempt'**: No past initiated lethal action described.  
    - **Behavior**: Strong suicidal intent + imminent plan (""tonight"") + contextual preparations (drunk, isolated, farewell). Vague method (""end it"") is compensated by high imminence and contextual cues.

189,"I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen. Will I be able to successfully end my life? I'm fairly short, male and 56 kg.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific substances (800mg codeine + ibuprofen) and asks if they can ""successfully end my life.""  
   - Provides physical details (height, weight, gender) to assess lethality.  
   - Explicit desire to die is central (""end my life"").  
   - No reference to past actions, preparations, or explicit negation of intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""end my life"" and seeks confirmation of method efficacy, confirming a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific substances (codeine/ibuprofen), quantities (800mg), and physical stats are provided to evaluate lethality. This indicates a concrete plan/method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past actions described (e.g., no mention of prior attempts). Focus is on future intent (""Will I be able to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** threshold met).  
   - Specific method/means discussed with operational details (substances, dosage, physical traits) → **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated action (rules out **Attempt**).  
   - Not **Indicator** because suicidal desire is personal, explicit, and unnegated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes expressions of hopelessness (""failed everything,"" ""wasted it,"" ""never been happy since birth""), despair (""i fucking cant do this anymore""), anhedonia (""not happy or enjoying anythnig""), and being a burden/perceived isolation (""nobody fucking understands me"").  
   - Explicit references to suicidal desire: ""resisting the desire to end,"" ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""can't stand being here any other moment,"" ""can't imagine myself living another year this way.""  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""bridge,"" ""pills"").  
   - No description of past actions initiated by the author (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""desire to end,"" ""can't stand being here any other moment,"" and ""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive"" express a clear, personal desire for life to cease. The author does *not* state these thoughts are unwanted or resisted in a way that negates the desire (e.g., ""I don’t actually want to die""). Instead, resisting the desire is framed as a burdensome struggle.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No references to methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timelines (""tonight""). The distress is existential but lacks actionable intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing suffering (""everyday,"" ""since birth"") and future dread (""can't live like this for the rest of my life"").  
   - **No past actions described**. Mentions ""resisting the desire"" historically but no initiated self-harm (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The post unequivocally expresses a personal desire to die (""desire to end"") and hopelessness about continuing life. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation supports this. The lack of explicitly *unwanted* thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"") rules out 'Indicator'. No plan/method implies 'Behavior' is inapplicable, and no past initiated actions rule out 'Attempt'.

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and discusses telling loved ones about the probability of future suicide. It expresses a sense of inevitability (""will probably... eventually"") but does not specify any methods, plans, preparations, or timelines. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness or resignation, but no references to past actions or high imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the phrase ""commit suicide,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - It expresses a personal expectation or belief about future suicide (""I will probably commit suicide eventually""), implying a desire for life to end or a lack of hope, but it is framed as a future probability rather than an immediate, urgent desire. There is no explicit negation of the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't want to""), so the suicidal intent is present but not immediate.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are described. The focus is on communication (""how do you tell""), which is not a preparatory step for the act itself.
   - Despite the explicit desire, there is no indication of a plan, method, or intended action, and imminence is low due to ""eventually."" Thus, this does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post refers to a future possibility (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), not a past or recent action. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to"" or ""I took pills""), so Attempt does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a belief in future suicide (""will probably commit suicide""), which aligns with Ideation. There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out Behavior. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to""), so it does not fit Indicator. No past action is described, so Attempt is not relevant. The key phrase ""I will probably commit suicide"" indicates a current expression of suicidal ideation without actionable elements.

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of suicide/death: The phrase ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" directly references suicide ideation via external ""voices,"" but it is attributed to an external source (voices) rather than a personal expression. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong distress is evident (e.g., ""losing grip,"" ""can't cope,"" ""can't stop crying,"" feelings of being overwhelmed by financial mistakes, and hopelessness about solutions). The writer expresses a desire to live: ""I wanna see my daughters grow up,"" which explicitly counters the suicidal thoughts.
   - Plan/method/preparation: None identified. The suicidal thought is passive (voices telling him) with no indication of planning, intended action, or imminence (e.g., no timeframe like ""tonight"").
   - Past actions: References financial mistakes from years ago but no mention of past suicidal actions, attempts, or self-harm.
   - Stated desire: The writer clearly states an unwanted aspect of suicidal thoughts (""I wanna see my daughters grow up"") and expresses distress about the thoughts rather than a personal wish to die. The suicidal ideation is framed as intrusive (from ""voices"") and resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Explicit mention of suicide: Yes (""end myself"").
   - Clear personal desire to die: No. The desire is negated by the writer's stated wish to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""), indicating the thoughts are unwanted. The phrase ""voices... telling me to just end myself"" suggests the ideation is externalized and not embraced.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation mentioned. The reference to ""end myself"" is vague, with no details on how, when, or where. No imminence (e.g., no urgent timeframe) is indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes current distress and suicidal thoughts but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions. The financial mistakes are past events, but not suicidal in nature.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted and not desired by the writer (e.g., countered by ""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts without a personal desire to die.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - While suicidal ideation is mentioned, the explicit negation of desire and lack of personal endorsement align with 'Indicator' rather than 'Ideation'. Phrases like ""I hate living"" (which would lean to Ideation) are absent; instead, the focus is on coping struggles and resisting intrusive thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hope for the future after leaving an abusive relationship, with a focus on finding support or being okay alone. It mentions mental health struggles but frames them in a positive, forward-looking context. The key phrase is ""maybe i don't need to die,"" which explicitly negates a desire for death. No mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations are present. Emotional indicators include current distress (""i'm not okay right now"") but are outweighed by hopefulness and resilience. There is no reference to past actions, plans, or imminence of suicide. The writer's stated desire is to live and improve, not to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die is expressed; instead, the phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" explicitly rejects the idea of dying, indicating unwanted thoughts or a past consideration that is being dismissed. This leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The absence of suicidal desire (from step 2) means this step is not applicable for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and future hopes, not past events. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" demonstrates that any suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die, fitting the 'Indicator' definition. The post centers on general distress and mental health challenges but lacks expressions of genuine suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die""). Hopeful language dominates, and there is no ambiguity about desire—death is rejected. No plan, method, or past attempt is present, ruling out 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" occurring when bored.
   - Explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn"" (right now).
   - Asks about lethality of taking 3 Xanax pills but frames it as seeking calmness due to boredom (""i just wanna be calm rn"").
   - Notes that suicidal thoughts are unwanted (""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there"").
   - Demands no劝阻 (""dont tell me not to do this"") but clarifies intent is curiosity about consequences, not suicide (""i just wanna know what is the worst thing"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **No explicit desire to die**: Directly negates intent with ""i dont wanna die rn"".
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but framed as an *unwanted* byproduct of boredom. The primary focus is on drug use for calming, not self-harm.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**
   - Xanax mention is tied to managing boredom, not a suicide plan. The question about dying is hypothetical (""i dont think thats possible"") and lacks preparatory language (e.g., no ""I have pills ready"").
   - No stated plan, method for suicide, or imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**
   - No past suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried this before"").
   - No current/future suicidal action implied—drug use is discussed for sedation, not lethality.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator**: Suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted and contextualized as passive/distressing intrusions (""thoughts are always there""). The core sentiment is distress about boredom and intrusive thoughts, not a genuine desire to die. The Xanax inquiry lacks suicidal intent (framed as risk assessment for calming, not planning). Phrases like ""I hate living"" (absent here) would shift to Ideation, but the explicit negation of death wish (""dont wanna die rn"") anchors this in Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions self-harm (""what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"").
   - Expresses intense guilt (""i am a fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage"") and hopelessness.
   - Explicitly states suicidal intent: ""i will wait until I can kill myself.""
   - No specific suicide method, tool, location, or preparation described (self-harm inquiry is separate from suicide plan).
   - No past suicidal actions described; focus is on future conditional intent (""if he is dead... will wait"").
   - Desire to die is explicit and personal, not negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself."" Expresses a clear desire to die conditionally. No indication thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Self-harm inquiry**: Asks about concealed self-harm methods, but this is distinct from the suicide statement.
   - **Suicide statement**: Mentions intent to act (""kill myself"") but only conditionally (""if he is dead"") and with vague timing (""wait until I can""). No method, tools, location, or preparations described for suicide. The phrasing ""wait until I can"" suggests uncertainty about means/opportunity, not concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past suicidal actions. The suicide reference is future-oriented and conditional.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""kill myself"") → Rules out *Indicator*.
   - **No specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent action** for suicide (conditional/vague intent; self-harm is separate) → Rules out *Behavior*.
   - **No past initiated lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.
   - **Personal desire to die + no plan/action** → Matches *Ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""kill myself"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""people don't care,"" ""wish I wasn't born,"" ""life is fucking stupid"").  
   - Stated intention: ""soon"" indicates imminence.  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or past action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly states ""kill myself"" and ""wish I wasn't born,"" confirming personal desire to die.  
   - No negation of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - ""Soon"" implies imminence but lacks concrete details about *how* the act would occur.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes current/future intention (""going to kill myself soon"").  
   - No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong explicit desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""wish I wasn't born"") → **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation → **Ideation** (despite ""soon"" indicating intent, vagueness of method/preparation keeps it in Ideation).  
   - **Attempt**: Not applicable (no past/recent initiated action).

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground,"" which is a specific method of suicide (jumping from a height) and implies a desire for death (""corpse"").
   - Emotional indicators include ""tempted,"" guilt, fear, and ambivalence about consequences (e.g., fear of surviving injured or burdening others).
   - Specific method is clearly stated (""plummet to the ground"" from a ""highest floor""), but no preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) or past actions are mentioned.
   - Imminence: The word ""tempted"" suggests a current urge but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), and the ""if only"" clauses indicate hesitation, reducing immediacy.
   - Stated desire: There is a personal desire to die (""plummet to the ground"" to become a ""corpse""), but it is conflicted by guilt and fear. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""plummet to the ground"" in context strongly implies a suicidal act with a desire for death.
   - Expressions like ""so tempted"" and the outcome of becoming a ""corpse"" convey a personal desire to die, despite ambivalence. There is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or not desired.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""plummet to the ground"") and a location (""highest floor""), which constitutes a method in the context of suicidal behavior.
   - No preparations or intended actions beyond the temptation are described (e.g., no note, no imminent plan).
   - With explicit desire present, the mention of a method (even in a hypothetical context) leans toward 'Behavior'. The temptation (""so tempted to just go"") implies an intended action, though it is not highly imminent due to the expressed fears.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current temptation with no reference to past actions (e.g., no prior attempts). It is focused on future intention, not initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Not 'Indicator': There is a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""plummet to the ground"" for death), and thoughts are not explicitly unwanted.
   - Not 'Ideation': Although there is desire, the specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and location (""highest floor"") are mentioned, moving it beyond mere thoughts. The temptation implies consideration of action.
   - Not 'Attempt': No past or recent initiated lethal action is described.
   - 'Behavior' fits best: The post expresses suicidal desire combined with a specific method and intended action (implied by ""tempted to just go""), despite the lack of high imminence or preparations. The hesitation does not negate the presence of a method, and vagueness in plan is resolved by the clear method reference.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include relationship distress (e.g., ""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend"") and a possible sense of guilt or being a burden (implied by the idea that the boyfriend ""wont feel that bad"" if suicide occurs).
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no details on how, when, or where the suicide might occur).
   - No references to past actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts or self-harm).
   - No imminence is indicated; the statement is conditional (""if I kill myself"") and speculative, not stating a current or immediate intention.
   - The writer's desire: The phrase ""kill myself"" suggests personal suicidal thoughts, but it is framed hypothetically and not explicitly negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""). However, the conditional nature (""if"") and the question ""Any thoughts?"" could imply ambivalence, but the core expression of suicidal intent remains.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, the post expresses a desire to die through this phrase, as it personalizes the act of suicide. Although conditional, it implies that suicide is a considered outcome.
   - No, there is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""I don't want to die"" or similar). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation' or higher, not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied (e.g., ""kill myself"" is vague, with no details on means).
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means).
   - Despite the explicit desire, there is no indication of a plan, intended action, or imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The vagueness and conditional framing support 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario, not a past event or current intention. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action by the author (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").
   - Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply, as there is no mention of a past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted, so it is not 'Indicator'.
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or imminent action, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The core element is the expression of suicidal desire in a personal context, making 'Ideation' the best fit. The conditional framing (""if"") and lack of details do not override the explicit suicidal intent.

Final category: 'Ideation'.

   - Describes repeated preparatory actions: physically going to the ledge, sitting/standing there for extended periods (""sometimes for an hour"") to ""work up the nerve.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness/despair (""no one has ever stopped,"" ""someone... looked at me and kept walking"").

   - Ambivalent desire: ""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"" contrasts with actively seeking intervention (""hoping... someone will stop me"").  
   - Timeframe: Ongoing/recent behavior (""last time,"" ""I go"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct reference to suicidal action (""jump"") and implicit desire through repeated high-risk behavior. Ambivalence (""can’t get the nerve"") doesn’t negate the underlying intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""jump""), location (hospital parking garage ledge), and repeated preparatory actions (physically positioning self on the ledge to overcome hesitation).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/recurring behavior** (going to the ledge, attempting to gather courage) but **no past initiated lethal action** by the author. Mentions another person’s suicide (historical, not author’s attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong evidence for **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (via ""jump"" references), specific method/location, and recurring preparatory actions (going to the ledge).  
   - Not *Attempt*: No description of past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., stepping off the ledge).  
   - Not *Ideation*: Actions go beyond passive thoughts (physical preparation is present).  
   - Not *Indicator*: Personal desire to act is evident despite ambivalence; method/preparation negate this category.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions past suicide attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger..."" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life...""
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts/desire: ""my death seems to [be] the ultimate answer,"" ""searching about ways to kill myself.""
   - Method/preparation: Past use of a phone charger for an attempt; recent research on methods to make suicide look accidental.
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""life is going absolutely shitty""), feeling like a burden (""everything I earned was just mooching""), and isolation (""drove everyone away"").
   - Imminence: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but active research indicates ongoing risk.
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (e.g., ""death seems [like] the ultimate answer"") without explicit negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life,"" and ""searching about ways to kill myself"" confirm personal suicidal intent. No statements rejecting the desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Past method described (phone charger as substitute for rope). Recent preparation through research (""searching about ways to kill myself... to look like an accident""). No specific *future* plan stated, but active research implies intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **Past initiated actions**: Multiple suicide attempts explicitly described (phone charger incident, other unelaborated attempts). The phrase ""tried committing suicide"" confirms initiation of a potentially lethal act.
   - **Current context**: Mentions recent research into methods, linking past attempts to ongoing struggles.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Attempt** applies because the author unambiguously describes past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts""). The historical nature (""when I was..."") doesn’t negate this, as the attempts are discussed in the context of current distress.  
   - While current suicidal behavior (researching methods) is present, the explicit recounting of past attempts takes precedence per guidelines.  
   - Ideation/Behavior are secondary here; the core classification hinges on the disclosed suicide attempts.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""nobody cares about me,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""done with everything,"" ""done trying my best.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness and despair but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**.  
   - ""Dead inside"" is metaphorical (emotional numbness), not literal. ""Done with everything"" indicates profound exhaustion but not a stated desire to die.  
   - No temporal context for past/current actions (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""planned to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or ""end my life.""  
   - ""Dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" **do not explicitly express a desire to die**; they reflect emotional depletion.  
   - **No mention of suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No descriptions** of past/current self-initiated harmful actions (e.g., no ""tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks **personal desire to die**, **suicidal thoughts**, **plans**, or **past actions**.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: expressions of despair without suicidal intent or ideation. Metaphors like ""dead inside"" are non-literal here.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" which implies a method of self-harm (suicide by jumping). It also references specific environmental details (""trees and mud below"") that reduce fear, indicating a concrete location.
   - Emotional indicators include building courage (""I'm getting more courage""), which suggests determination to act, and a sense of imminence (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - There is a clear stated desire to carry out the action, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump off"" and ""jump out"" are strong euphemisms for suicidal action in context.
   - It expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I think I can jump off"" and ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), with no negation of the desire.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted and the language implies a genuine wish to act, this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from a bedroom window, with details about the location (trees and mud below) that show consideration of the means.
   - Preparations are implied through mental readiness (""getting more courage""), but no physical acts (e.g., writing a note) are described.
   - With explicit desire and high imminence (""soon""), the vague reference to action (""do it"") coupled with a specific method confirms planning/intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I think I can,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), not past actions. There is no mention of a prior initiated event (e.g., ""I tried to jump"").
   - This rules out 'Attempt', as no past or recent self-initiated lethal action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (wanting to jump to die) moves this beyond 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about personal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The specific method (jumping from a bedroom window) and imminent intention (""soon"") indicate a plan, so it is not just 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - With desire plus method and imminence, this fits 'Behavior'. The lack of past action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Even though ""I think I can"" shows some uncertainty, the context (building courage, environmental details) confirms intent to act.

Final category: Behavior, due to suicidal desire combined with a specific method and imminent intention.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses family dynamics, depression, and reluctance to seek help. It explicitly mentions ""writing suicide notes"" during depressive episodes. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (""it would be easier to keep it to myself""), feeling like a burden (""I feel like I'd just waste their time""), and frustration with therapy. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide methods, or specific plans (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). The phrase ""writing suicide notes"" indicates preparation for suicide, but it is described as a recurring behavior during depressive lows, not with high imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). The author does not express a clear, current desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""), nor are suicidal thoughts explicitly stated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It references suicide notes, which imply suicidal thoughts but do not directly state a personal desire to die. There is no expression like ""I want to be gone"" or ""life isn't worth it"" that clearly conveys a wish for death. Suicidal thoughts (inferred from note-writing) are not negated as unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on them""). Therefore, explicit suicidal desire is not present, but the preparation (note-writing) suggests underlying intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method or plan is not mentioned (e.g., no pills, gun, or location). However, ""writing suicide notes"" is identified as a preparation, which aligns with the Behavior category definition (e.g., ""writing my suicide note"" is listed as a preparation). This preparation is coupled with the context of recurrent depression, but without high imminence or intent to act immediately. Since there is no method or plan beyond preparation, and desire is not explicit, this leans toward Behavior due to the clear preparatory action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ""writing suicide notes"" as something that occurs during depressive episodes (""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes""). This is a recurring, preparatory behavior, not a specific past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"" or ""I attempted""). It does not qualify as an Attempt because no self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ingesting pills) is described; note-writing is preparatory only.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress and depression but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die""), so it is not purely Ideation. However, the mention of suicide note-writing is a preparation, which elevates it beyond general distress (Indicator). Since preparations are explicitly part of the Behavior definition (""writing my suicide note""), and there is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts, this fits Behavior. There is no past attempt described, so Attempt is ruled out. The ambiguity in desire is resolved by the presence of preparation, and imminence is low, but the preparation itself suffices for Behavior.

People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""No one cares not even me""), despair (""i suddenly get all depressed""), and self-loathing (""maybe i just need attention""). It mentions death explicitly with ""hope that asshole dies hope i die"" and ""People dying is funny,"" as well as ""fuck me fuck da world,"" which conveys a desire for personal death or escape.
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: While there is no direct reference to suicide (e.g., ""kill myself""), the phrase ""hope i die"" indicates a personal wish for death, which is a form of suicidal ideation. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or locations are mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair, worthlessness (""not even me"" cares), and anhedonia (mocking the world as ""funny"" in a bitter context) are present.
   - Past actions: No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions initiated by the author.
   - Imminence: No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") suggesting immediate action; the expressions are general and lack urgency.
   - Stated desire: The phrase ""hope i die"" expresses a genuine wish for death, not explicitly negated as unwanted. The self-critical comment (""maybe i just need attention"") suggests ambivalence but does not clearly state that the thoughts are unwanted or that there is no desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide: No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Clear desire to die: Yes, ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of wanting death or for life to end, similar to ""I hate living"" in tone and context. This is not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so it indicates personal suicidal intent.
   - Unwanted thoughts: No explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted; the ambivalence (""maybe i just need attention"") does not negate the desire, as it could be part of the distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, note-writing) is mentioned. References to death are vague (""hope i die"") and lack actionable details.
   - No indication of planning or intended action, even with high emotional intensity. The context does not imply imminence or a concrete step toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and abstract wishes, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). Mentions of death are hypothetical or expressive, not based on historical events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key phrase ""hope i die"" demonstrates a personal desire to die, falling under 'Ideation' as defined (expressions of wanting life to end without a plan or method). While the post includes general distress and sarcasm, the suicidal desire is explicit and not negated, so it does not fit 'Indicator' (which requires unambiguous lack of personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Ambiguity between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation': ""hope i die"" is a strong expression akin to ""I hate living,"" which the guidelines classify as 'Ideation' unless desire is negated. Here, the desire is not negated, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements are: ""cut to deep"" (likely a typo for ""cut too deep""), which suggests a self-harm action involving cutting, and ""fuck,"" expressing frustration or distress.
   - There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm with suicidal intent. The phrase focuses on the act of cutting and its unintended depth.
   - Emotional indicators include distress (implied by ""fuck""), but no expressions of hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, being a burden, or hating life.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes) for suicide are mentioned. The action described (""cut"") is presented as a past event (""just"") with possible accidental severity (""too deep""), but not as part of a suicidal plan.
   - The temporal context is past (""just cut""), indicating a recent action initiated by the author. However, there is no indication this action was intended to be lethal or part of a suicide attempt.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous regarding suicide; it expresses distress about the outcome of the self-harm (""too deep"") but no personal wish to die or for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to be gone"" or ""life isn't worth it""). The focus is on the physical act and its consequences, not on a wish to die.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no statement about them being unwanted.
   - Overall, there is no explicit or strongly implied personal suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent, and the distress appears related to the self-harm incident itself.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (""cut"") is mentioned, but it is not framed in the context of a suicidal plan or intent. It could be non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) based on the wording.
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - There is no indication of imminence for future suicidal action, as the post describes a past event with no stated intention to escalate.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past action (""just cut"") that was self-initiated.
   - However, it does not describe a ""specific, potentially lethal action"" with suicidal intent. Cutting too deep could be harmful, but without context indicating it was a suicide attempt (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself by cutting""), it is more indicative of self-harm distress. The author does not link it to suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress through self-harm but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or intent. This aligns with 'Indicator', which covers general distress or self-harm without suicidal elements.
   - 'Ideation' requires explicit desires to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), which are absent.
   - 'Behavior' would require suicidal thoughts coupled with a plan, method, or intended action, but no suicidal thoughts are expressed, and the cutting is not presented as part of a suicidal plan.
   - 'Attempt' requires a description of a past, potentially lethal suicidal action, but the post does not indicate the cutting was intended to be lethal or suicidal.
   - Due to the ambiguity in suicidal intent and the absence of suicidal language, 'Indicator' is the best fit. Self-harm acts like cutting can be risk indicators but do not automatically imply suicide risk without additional context.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses intense anger and frustration towards people who respond to distress with generic advice like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"".
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration and feeling misunderstood, but no explicit hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, being a burden, or hating life from the author's personal perspective.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present.
   - No imminence of intentions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is stated.
   - The author refers to ""what I'm feeling,"" but this is vague and not elaborated as a desire to die; it appears to be distress about others' responses rather than a personal wish for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear personal expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living"").
   - The phrase ""what I'm feeling"" could imply underlying distress, but it is not specified as suicidal and lacks any negation or confirmation of suicidal desire. Without explicit suicidal intent, this leans away from Ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide.
   - No implied plan or intended action, even vaguely, as the focus is on criticizing others, not on the author's own behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current reaction to others' comments, with no reference to past or future suicidal actions by the author.
   - No description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of attempts), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress and frustration but lacks a personal, explicit expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, or intent. Phrases like ""what I'm feeling"" are ambiguous and not clarified as suicidal, especially since the context is venting about others.
   - Without any suicidal desire, plan, method, or action, the post does not meet the criteria for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt.
   - This fits 'Indicator' as it expresses distress (potentially in a suicide-related context) but without clear, current personal suicidal intent. The author's feelings are implied to be involuntary (""not by choice""), but they are not specified as suicidal or unwanted suicidal thoughts, aligning with the Indicator definition of abstract distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""i kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time,"" indicating conflicted suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""find everything boring""), isolation (""friends are the only thing keeping me going... they all left""), despair (""get bullied,"" ""stopped attending school,"" ""don't have good grades"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines mentioned.  
   - Desire to die is explicitly countered by ""dont at the same time,"" framing the thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""wanna die"" but immediately negates it (""but dont at the same time"").  
   - The phrasing (""if you get me"") underscores ambivalence, not a genuine wish to die.  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal thoughts are explicitly *unwanted* and conflicted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  
   - No implied action or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").

   - Strong emotional distress and hopelessness are evident, but no personal desire to act or plan exists.

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" increasing over months, a daily feeling of wanting to ""justify dying,"" and references ""partially planning to die."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""every single day I feel terrible""), self-loathing (""I fear I only hurt""), guilt, and anxiety. 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described. The phrase ""partially planning to die"" is vague and lacks concrete details about method, location, or timing. 
   - The author mentions impulsivity but does not state a current plan or imminent action (e.g., ""tonight""). 
   - The desire to die is explicit (""want to justify dying""), but thoughts are framed as persistent rather than actionable. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""justify dying,"" and ""planning to die."" The desire to die is personal and current (""every single day""). No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"") is present. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No. ""Partially planning to die"" is ambiguous and lacks specificity. No tools, substances, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to impulsivity (""I know how impulsive... I can get"") suggests risk but not a defined plan.

209,"they took the last bit of stability i have. i just got laid off from my well paying, work from home, low stress, work at your own pace, non-entry level job on wednesday. they took the last bit of stability i have in my life. i live alone because my ex was an abusive pos who i escaped so i have no partner to help keep me afloat till i find something new. i can't rely on my mom because she just lost her job too and im too prideful to tell my dad i don't have a job anymore. i'm also in school which i may have to withdraw from. i lost everything that made me feel comfortable in life in a 5 minute zoom call. i can't ever find a job that pays as much because my role was very specific to the company and is not widely available elsewhere. it's also not something i can use as a marketable skill elsewhere. my life has always been shit but being able to finally support myself was the only thing that made me feel okay about being me. but i guess my ex was right about me, i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead. and now its gone. and likely won't come back for years and years and years, if ever. i'm so tired of having everything decent or good in my life taken from me. theres no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game. its just struggle and work and work and work and then when you finally get something positive out of life it's ripped away from you. i'm just an ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going. ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears. now i really don't care any more. my parents are the reason i have to suffer, why should i care about them? they didnt care about my future to invest in it when they had the means to, why should i care about their emotional state?. i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself"", ""rest in peace"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""no reason to keep going""), despair (""life has always been shit""), worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid girl""), and burden (""no partner, no job"").  
   - Specific plan/method: Explicitly describes driving to the mountains to ""hang myself"" in a secluded spot.  
   - Imminence: No immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but the plan is concrete.  
   - Desire to die: Strongly expressed (""better off dead,"" ""rest in peace"") without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""better off dead"" and ""hang myself"" directly express a personal desire to die. No indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method (hanging) and location (mountains away from paths) are detailed. No mention of active preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), but the plan is explicit and actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *future* intent (""I could just drive..."") with a method. No past initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die with no indication of unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Suicidal thoughts are paired with a specific plan/method (hanging in the mountains).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Clear desire to die + specific plan/method (hanging in a secluded mountain spot).

210,I want to be dead. I don't enjoy anything. I am lonely. I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants. I am not healing. It is terrible. I don't want to live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit statements expressing a desire to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""), emotional distress (anhedonia: ""I don't enjoy anything,"" loneliness: ""I am lonely,"" hopelessness: ""I am not healing. It is terrible""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The writer references seeking therapy and taking antidepressants, indicating help-seeking behavior, but this does not negate the expressed desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are personal expressions of suicidal intent. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so it does not lean toward Indicator.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The post focuses solely on thoughts and feelings, with no indication of planning, intended action, or imminence (e.g., no references to ""tonight"" or ""soon""). Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts in the present tense, with no references to past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Thus, Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore""), which aligns with Ideation. There is no evidence of unwanted suicidal thoughts (which would indicate Indicator), no plan/method/preparation (which would indicate Behavior), and no description of past actions (which would indicate Attempt). The help-seeking behavior (therapy and antidepressants) does not override the clear suicidal ideation expressed.

I take care of my body: I workout 5-7 times a week, I sleep 8-10 hrs a night, I eat nutritious meals. I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups. I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things. Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions being ""so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""  
   - It expresses hopelessness (""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""no hope or motivation to go on"") and frustration with persistent distress despite efforts to improve (""it's been years,"" ""still... suicidal"").  
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or tools are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions initiated by the author.  
   - Imminence is not indicated; the focus is on enduring long-term struggles.  
   - The writer describes suicidal thoughts as an ongoing burden but does not explicitly negate the desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I don’t want to act on these thoughts"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts"" confirm a personal desire to die or for life to end. The tone of despair (""I'm just tired of all of it"") reinforces this intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: There is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), or imminent action. The post focuses on emotional exhaustion and the persistence of thoughts, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future** suicidal thoughts but **no past actions**. References to ""years"" of struggle relate to enduring ideation, not a past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts"") is present without negation, so this is not Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Strong expressions of suicidal desire exist, but **no plan/method/preparation** is indicated. The vagueness and lack of actionable intent align with Ideation.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post meets the criteria for **Ideation** (explicit personal desire to die with no plan/method/action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses needing therapy for depression and anxiety, fear of parental judgment, and severe lack of motivation. 
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress (scared parents will judge him), hopelessness (""fucked up self""), and anhedonia (""no motivation to get up""). 
   - No explicit/implicit references to suicidal desire, plans, past attempts, or timelines.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No** direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - **No** expressions of desire to die (e.g., ""I hate living,"" ""want to disappear""). 
   - The distress is focused on barriers to accessing therapy, not suicidal thoughts. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No** references to plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No** descriptions of past or intended self-injurious actions.

   - No suicidal ideation, planning, or behavior indicated. 
   - Aligns with **Indicator**: distress about mental health without suicidal intent.

213,i watch a lot of crime videos on youtube and they just be giving me ideas. i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that. butttt i just saw a video about a woman who killed her husband by putting eye drops in his beverages and i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method 🧍‍♀️. *sigh*. i wish i wasn't like this :(,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and references a specific method (""putting eye drops in his beverages"") as an ""idea"" for suicide, but frames it as an intrusive thought from watching crime videos. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress about having these thoughts (e.g., ""I try to suppress my suicidal thoughts,"" ""I wish I wasn't like this""), and the writer explicitly states they ""really don't want to have to do that,"" indicating a lack of genuine desire to act. 
   - There is no mention of plans, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., no tools acquired, no notes written, no timeframe like ""tonight""). The method is described passively as an ""idea"" and not an intention. 
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current thoughts. 
   - The writer's stated desire is against acting on suicidal thoughts, emphasizing suppression and not wanting to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicitly mentioned, but the writer negates any personal desire to die: ""I really don't want to have to do that."" The phrase ""I wish I wasn't like this"" expresses distress about having unwanted thoughts, not a wish for death. This strongly leans toward 'Indicator' as the suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted and not representing a current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (""putting eye drops"") is mentioned, but it is framed as an unwanted ""idea"" sparked by a video, not as a plan or intended action. There is no indication of preparation, imminence, or intent to act (e.g., no ""I will do this""). Coupled with the explicit lack of desire from Step 2, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. It remains an intrusive thought.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current thoughts and feelings, with no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The key factor is the explicit statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted and suppressed, with no genuine desire to die. This fits 'Indicator' (distress about unwanted thoughts). The mention of a method does not elevate it to 'Behavior' because it lacks intent, plan, or imminence and is negated by the writer. 'Ideation' is not applicable as there is no expression of a personal desire to die (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent, and existing thoughts are rejected). 'Attempt' is ruled out due to no described actions.

214,"I think I've come to realize I'm the common denominator in all of my problems. A month ago I wrote a suicide note. I realized the date when I was going through my screenshots and found the note, primed and ready to be posted on social media so nobody wonders why I stopped responding to calls or going to work. Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes the author writing a suicide note a month ago, planning a specific time and place for suicide, and preparing it to be posted posthumously. They mention self-sabotage (not following through) but express a current desire to re-experience the ""calm"" feeling of having a plan and state, ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time."" Key elements: explicit planning (note, time, place), preparations (note primed for posting), references to past preparations, and current desire to reignite suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. Phrases like ""suicide note,"" ""free myself of my problems"" (euphemism for suicide), and ""do it this time"" (referencing suicide) convey a personal desire to die. The current statement (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it"") implies ongoing intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The author explicitly describes past preparations: writing a suicide note, selecting a time/place, and priming it for social media posting. While no *current* method is detailed, the expressed desire to revive the plan (""coax the feeling back out"") and the statement ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" imply imminent behavioral intent linked to the existing plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes **past preparations** (note written/primed, plan made) but no past *initiated lethal action* (they ""sabotaged"" themselves, so no attempt occurred). The focus is on reigniting the plan for potential future action (""this time"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (Step 2) and detailed past plan/preparations (Step 3) rule out 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.
   - No past *initiated lethal action* occurred (self-sabotaged), so it is not an 'Attempt'.
   - The combination of **current suicidal intent** (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") with **references to a concrete past plan/preparations** (note, time, place) and **imminent behavioral reinstatement** (""coax the feeling back out"") fits 'Behavior'. The author is describing preparatory actions and signaling intent to act.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay.

As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""I don't feel it will ever end""), despair (""I feel like utter hell""), worthlessness (""a stain upon the world""), isolation (""so alone and forgotten""), and trauma (PTSD, abuse history).  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods.  
   - Phrases like ""I wish I wasn't alone"" and ""I wish I had love"" focus on unmet relational needs, not a desire to die.  
   - The closest reference to death is ""the world would not change at all if I were gone,"" but this reflects perceived insignificance rather than active suicidal desire.  
   - **Crucially**: The author states, ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present,"" explicitly countering a wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent.  
   - Expressions of despair (""I feel like an outcast,"" ""hanging on by threads"") are severe but **lack personal desire for death or life-ending**.  
   - The statement ""if I were gone"" is passive and hypothetical, not an expression of intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit or implied suicidal desire; distress is centered on pain and isolation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  
   - Focus remains on enduring pain (""trying to find worth in the present"") and emotional struggle.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No description** of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). References to past trauma (""father beat me"") are not suicidal behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **extreme distress** (hopelessness, worthlessness, isolation) but **no personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or past attempt**.  
   - The author's active effort to ""find worth in the present"" and absence of death-seeking language aligns with **Indicator**.  
   - Phrases like ""if I were gone"" are abstract and lack suicidal intent; they reflect a perception of insignificance, not ideation.  
   - **Final Verdict**: 'Indicator' – profound distress without suicidal ideation or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide methods: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself"". 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm done with life"") and feelings of being a burden (""all I cause is pain""). 
   - Specific plans and methods are detailed: the author intends to either slit their wrists in a broken car or hang themselves from a tree on ""Tuesday"", indicating a timeline and means. 
   - There is no reference to past actions; the post focuses on future intentions. 
   - Imminence is high due to the specified near-future timeline (""Tuesday""). 
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""make me want to die"", ""I'm done with life"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""want to die"", ""slit my wrist"", and ""hang myself"". 
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm done with life""). 
   - There is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the author affirms the intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods (slitting wrists or hanging) and locations (broken car or tree) are mentioned. 
   - Preparations are not explicitly described, but the detailed plan with a timeline (""Tuesday"") indicates intended action. 
   - Given the high imminence (""Tuesday"") and explicit intent, this confirms a plan for action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""Tuesday, I'm either going to..."") with no mention of past actions. 
   - Since no self-initiated, potentially lethal action from the past is described, this does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. 
   - The presence of specific methods, plans, and imminence elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which would involve thoughts without plans). 
   - With no past action described, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. 
   - The combination of suicidal intent, detailed methods, and a timeline indicates 'Behavior'.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please,"" ""I’m not afraid of death.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Why do I struggle... if it won't lead to anything?""), emptiness after temporary happiness, guilt about burdening others.
   - Desire assessment: Clear expressions of *wanting* death (e.g., ""Sign me up"") with no explicit negation of personal desire. Barriers are external (guilt about impact on others), not internal rejection of suicidal urges.
   - Plan/method/preparation: **None mentioned.** No references to tools, locations, timelines, or preparatory actions.
   - Past actions: No description of prior suicide attempts or self-harm.
   - Imminence: No stated timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes.** Direct phrases include ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""better if I was dead,"" and endorsement of eternal sleep as desirable. The writer expresses a personal wish for death despite acknowledging conflicting feelings about consequences.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **None.** No method (pills, weapons, etc.), location, or preparation (notes, goodbyes) is described. The post focuses solely on thoughts, feelings, and hypothetical barriers.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **current** suicidal thoughts and philosophical acceptance of death. No reference to past or imminent self-initiated actions.

     - Explicit personal desire to die is present (e.g., ""Sign me up"").  
     - **No plan, method, or preparation** is indicated. Barriers (guilt, responsibility) reflect ambivalence but not rejection of suicidal *desire*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past experience calling a hotline when distressed (no method/plan mentioned) that resulted in police/psych ward intervention.  
   - States this experience ""made me 10x more suicidal"" but frames this as a past emotional reaction, not current intent.  
   - Expresses current distress, paranoia (""I'm paranoid after what happened""), and worry about location tracking.  
   - Seeks an anonymous hotline to talk without intervention.  
   - **No explicit desire to die, suicide plans, methods, preparations, or references to past/current self-harm actions.**  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die.  
   - Mentions past increased suicidality as a *consequence* of institutionalization but does not state a current personal wish to die.  
   - Focus is on avoiding intervention, not expressing active suicidal thoughts.

   - **No description of self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose""). The psych ward stay was an imposed consequence, not a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress, fear of institutionalization, and historical suicidality as a reaction to trauma.  
   - Lacks current personal desire to die, suicidal intent, plan, method, or description of past self-harm actions.  
   - Suicidal thoughts (""more suicidal"") are framed as an unwanted outcome of prior intervention, aligning with **Indicator** (distress about suicide-related experiences without current personal intent).

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements are: ""I dont want to live anymore"" expresses a clear desire for life to end, indicating hopelessness and despair. ""This is not right"" suggests distress, and ""I just want be by myself"" may imply isolation. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods (e.g., pills, weapons). No specific plans, preparations, locations, or timeframes (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The post is in the present tense, with no references to past actions. The writer's stated desire (""I dont want to live anymore"") is a personal expression of wanting life to end without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted on.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, which strongly implies suicidal ideation. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") to suggest the thoughts are unwanted; the desire is presented as genuine and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances), plan, intended action, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The statement is purely about the desire to not live, with no indication of how or when it might be acted upon, even vaguely.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings only; there is no mention of past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., attempts). All content is focused on present emotional state and desire.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to not live (""I dont want to live anymore""), which aligns with 'Ideation' as defined (explicit expressions of wanting life to end without a plan or method). It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is not ambiguous or explicitly unwanted (e.g., no distress about the thoughts themselves). There is no plan, method, or preparation to elevate it to 'Behavior', and no described past action for 'Attempt'.

I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS LIKE ARE U JUST PLAIN STUPID. MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP. AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger and frustration towards people who dismiss suicidal individuals as ""attention-seeking."" 
   - Key emotional indicators: feeling invalidated (""Everything I do... I get called out for 'attention seeking'""), hopelessness (""They won't believe it until I die""), and distress about neglect (""I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT""). 
   - Mentions ""suicidal"" hypothetically (referencing others' statements) but **no explicit personal desire to die, suicide plans, methods, or preparations**. 
   - Strongly emphasizes **seeking help** (""I still need help"") and **resisting suicidal urges** (""trying to fucking hold on""). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No**. The author references suicidal ideation indirectly through others' accusations but never personally states a desire to die. Instead, they assert their struggle to ""hold on"" and need for support, framing suicidal thoughts as something they are actively resisting. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None**. No mention of personal plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The hypothetical ""ended it silently"" references others' rhetoric, not the author's intentions. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** described. References to neglect (""I DID [ask for help]"") relate to seeking support, not suicide attempts. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core sentiment is distress about invalidation, unmet support needs, and stigma—**not a personal expression of suicidal desire**. 
   - While suicidal ideation is contextually implied (via others' accusations), the author **explicitly frames their struggle as resisting these thoughts** (""trying to hold on"") and seeking help. 
   - No evidence of personal ideation, plan, or past attempt. Fits **Indicator**: distress about suicidal stigma and unwanted thoughts, without personal intent.

Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions death/suicide: ""I feel like killing my self every day"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no more strenght"", ""nothing here for me""), despair (""it huts so much"").
   - Specific plans/preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"".
   - Imminence: ""this might be my final good bye"".
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""killing my self"") with no negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Direct phrases: ""killing my self"" (Yes).
   - Desire to die: Strongly implied through daily suicidal feelings (Yes).
   - Unwanted thoughts: No negation of desire; distress is tied to circumstances, not rejection of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - Preparations explicitly stated: Suicide note, bills, and testament are ready (""all done"").
   - Coupled with imminent intent (""final good bye"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Focuses on *current* preparations and imminent intent (""final good bye"").
   - No description of past initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). References to past disappointments don’t qualify as attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Strong explicit desire to die (Ideation base) + concrete preparations (note, testament) = **Behavior**.
   - No past initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Preparations confirm intent beyond mere thoughts, distinguishing from 'Ideation'.
   - Explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator'.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kms"" (kill myself), ""going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I can't stop cutting,"" ""about to kms,"" ""gonna keep it all in and kms soon.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can't talk to anyone,"" ""I'm not ok""), isolation, guilt (""embarrassed myself""), and feeling trapped.  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"").  
   - Plan/method: No specific method, location, or preparation described (e.g., pills, notes). ""Cutting"" is noted but is non-lethal self-harm.  
   - Imminence: ""Very soon,"" ""soon,"" ""about to kms"" (though delayed by concern for dog).  
   - Stated desire: Unambiguous wish to die (""I finally accepted...""), with no negation of intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kms,"" ""kill myself,"" ""going to die"" are direct.  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire (""accepted the fact,"" ""I know I am [going to kill myself]"").  
   - **No**: Thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted/distressing; they are accepted as inevitable.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Cutting is mentioned but is non-suicidal self-harm. No tools, locations, or plans described.  
   - **Intent + Imminence**: High intent (""accepted,"" ""I know I am"") and temporal urgency (""very soon,"" ""soon"") but **no actionable plan or method** implied beyond vague timing (delayed by the dog).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Future intention**: Focuses on *future* suicide (""going to kill myself very soon"").  
   - **No past action**: Describes self-harm (cutting) and social withdrawal but **no mention of past suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die, not abstract distress.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past initiated suicidal actions.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - Strong desire and intent present (Ideation).  
     - **No plan/method/preparation**: ""Soon"" indicates intent but lacks concrete details (how, where, means). Cutting is not a suicidal method.  
     - High imminence alone is insufficient for Behavior without even vague method/plan.  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets **Ideation** (explicit desire, no actionable plan).

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanna kill myself,"" ""shoot myself on the spot,"" references to a suicide note, and statements like ""I shouldn’t have to stay alive.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Anger, hopelessness (""I don’t care""), resentment toward family, and feeling burdened.  
   - Plan/method: ""shoot myself"" specifies a method; suicide note confirms preparation.  
   - Imminence: ""on the spot"" implies immediate intent.  
   - Desire: Strong personal wish to die (e.g., ""makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""shoot myself"").  
   - Desire is affirmed (""I shouldn’t have to stay alive"") without negation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method: ""shoot myself"" explicitly states a lethal means.  
   - Preparation: Suicide note (discarded but created).  
   - Imminence: ""on the spot"" signals urgency.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent and preparations (suicide note).  
   - No description of a past *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""tried to shoot myself""). Arguments/intervention are confrontations, not attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - ""Shoot myself"" and suicide note override ambiguity.  
   - No past initiated lethal action (Attempt not applicable).  
   - Strong intent + plan/method rules out Ideation/Indicator.

224,"Think I'm going to OD today. I have a month's prescription for venlafaxine, quitaepine, zolfresh and inderal and idk it's probably not even lethal but I feel like popping all of them at once and hope for the best, I can't feel anything right now and it's all I can think about. Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""OD today"" (overdose) and lists specific medications (venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolpidem, propranolol), indicating a method. The phrase ""popping all of them at once"" describes an intended action. Emotional indicators include ""I can't feel anything right now"" (numbness/despair) and ""it's all I can think about"" (preoccupation with suicidal thoughts). There is a specific plan with high imminence (""today""). The user also references past suicidal thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while"") but no past actions like an attempt. The stated desire is to act (""hope for the best""), implying a wish for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and describes a desire to die through the planned overdose (""hope for the best"" in context). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon; instead, the user is considering action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (overdosing on named medications), and the user has the means (""a month's prescription""). The imminence is high (""today""), and the intent to act is clear. This satisfies the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on a future intention (""Think I'm going to OD today"") and past thoughts, but there is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt). The reference to ""thinking about suicide"" is ideation, not an action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (Ideation) combined with a specific plan, method, and preparation (having the medications) moves this to 'Behavior'. The high imminence (""today"") reinforces this. There is no ambiguity about the plan or method, and no past attempt is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The lack of negation of desire rules out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of depletion (""nothing left,"" ""completely used up""), hopelessness, and despair. It includes apologies and thank-yous to specific people (e.g., Mom, Dad), which resemble farewell messages. The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies a desire for life to end. There are no explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. No references to past actions, plans, methods, or preparations are present. The temporal context is current (""feels right now""), suggesting immediacy but not specifying a timeframe. The stated desire leans toward wanting life to end, without negation of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. However, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" expresses a clear personal desire for life to end in a context of despair, similar to ""I hate living."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on this""). Thus, this is not 'Indicator' but indicates 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The farewells could be interpreted as preparatory, but they are emotional expressions rather than concrete evidence of planning. The desire to die is present, but without any plan or method, even vaguely implied. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intention (""feels right now""), with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows a personal desire to die (""The end is the only thing that feels right now""), placing it in 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of personal desire). There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past action is described, so 'Attempt' is inapplicable. The expression of hopelessness and farewells support suicidal ideation without escalating to behavior.

My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions emotional distress (""feel so bad,"" ""terrible,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" ""mind is going crazy""), ongoing suicidal thoughts (""I was already suicidal and depressed""), and a specific method for self-harm: ""cutting my god damn throat."" The phrase ""all I want to do is"" expresses a current desire to act. There are no references to past actions, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or explicit imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on immediate emotional turmoil and an urge to use a lethal method to end thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to die through the statement ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat."" This indicates a personal wish for life to end to escape distress. There is no negation of the desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so it's not unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""cutting my god damn throat,"" which is a lethal means associated with suicide. This is coupled with the author's expressed desire (""all I want to do is""), implying an intended action. No preparations are described, but the presence of a method in the context of high distress and intent supports 'Behavior'. The lack of imminence (e.g., no ""now"" or ""tonight"") doesn't override this, as the method is explicit and directly tied to the desire.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and urges (e.g., ""It's late in the evening,"" ""I feel,"" ""all I want to do now""). There is no mention of a past initiated action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""); references to being ""already suicidal"" indicate ongoing ideation, not a specific past event. Thus, no 'Attempt' is present.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""all I want to do is cutting my god damn throat""), moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts). The specific method (""cutting my throat"") indicates a plan/intended action, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' (which lacks method/plan). With no past action described, 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a method, even without high imminence or preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses a quote about suicide: ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doesn't matter."" The user is sharing this quote and asking if anyone knows more about it. There is no personal expression of emotions like hopelessness, despair, or anhedonia from the user. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the user are mentioned. The quote contains suicidal content, but it is presented as an external reference, not as the user's own thoughts or feelings. There is no imminence or stated desire from the user regarding suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The quote explicitly mentions ""kill yourself,"" but this is not a personal statement from the user. The user does not express a personal desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). The suicidal content is attributed to the quote, not the user, and there is no indication that the user has unwanted suicidal thoughts or negates them personally. Since the user is only referencing the quote abstractly without personal endorsement, there is no explicit personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation by the user. The quote does not include these elements, and the user is not describing any intended actions. The focus is on the quote itself, not on any behavior by the user.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post does not describe any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions by the user (e.g., no references to attempts or preparatory steps). The user only mentions ""stumbling upon"" the quote recently, which is not an action related to suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post involves abstract discussion of suicide through a quote, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from the user. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes general or abstract mentions of suicide without clear, current, personal suicidal intent. Since the user is seeking information about the quote and not expressing personal distress or suicidal thoughts, 'Ideation' (which requires personal desire to die) does not apply. There is no evidence of 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: ""i want to leave earth,"" ""always end up wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog"" (implies desire for death/reunion), ""i can't do this anymore,"" expressions of hopelessness (""life will never get better""), chronic distress (BPD, lifelong unhappiness), and resignation (""i've accepted that"").  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""wanting to die,"" ""join my dog"" (strong implication of death).  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness, despair, anhedonia (""never been truly happy""), and perceived burdensomeness (""selfish"").

   - No past suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  
   - Imminence: ""now I'm ready"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete timing (e.g., ""tonight"") or actionable intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - **No negation** of the desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools mentioned.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly mentions past suicidal intent: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" 
    - It includes emotional context (grandfather's death, concern for mother's grief) and a stated decision not to act: ""Now, I know I can't do that... I couldn't add the loss of a child."" 
    - There is no mention of specific methods, preparations, timelines, or actions taken toward suicide. The plan (""before Christmas"") is referenced as past intention but explicitly abandoned. 
    - The author emphasizes unwanted thoughts (""I can't do that"") due to external consequences (impact on mother). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is explicit. 
    - However, the desire is **explicitly negated** (""I know I can't do that"") due to concern for others, framing the prior thoughts as unwanted in the present context. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

    - Suicidal desire was explicitly expressed in the past but is **currently stated as unwanted and actively rejected** due to external factors. 
    - No plan/method/preparation details support 'Behavior,' and no past action qualifies as 'Attempt.' 
    - The core of the post is distress about *having had* suicidal thoughts and relief from avoiding them, fitting 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts without current personal desire to die).

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide for days"" (February) and recurring thoughts triggered by family conflicts (""When we fight I always think about suicide"").
   - Explicitly states researching methods: ""I research for easy painless ways to kill myself.""
   - Expresses desire to die when triggered: ""triggers me to actually want to commit suicide.""
   - Emotional distress includes hopelessness (family dynamics, feeling invalidated) and self-doubt (""Am I faking my depression?"").
   - No mention of specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), past initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to...""), or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases include ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide,"" and ""kill myself."" The desire is personal and not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself"" implies exploration of methods, indicating planning. No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is named, but the act of researching methods constitutes preparatory behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes past/ongoing suicidal thoughts and research, but **no mention of past or recent initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts are present and not framed as unwanted.
   - **Not Ideation**: While suicidal thoughts/desire are central, the research into methods goes beyond passive ideation and indicates active planning (Behavior).
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/current initiated lethal actions.
   - **Behavior**: The combination of explicit suicidal desire (""want to commit suicide"") with research into methods (""easy painless ways to kill myself"") constitutes preparatory behavior, meeting the threshold for Behavior.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness with ""Life is useless,"" idealizes an afterlife without human suffering (""something better on the other side... no hunger no body or mind""), and advocates for normalizing ""Death and suicide."" There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators include despair and anhedonia (lack of value in life). The timeframe is present/general, with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer's desire appears to be a philosophical endorsement of death/suicide rather than an explicit personal wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide""? Yes, in ""Death and suicide need to be normalized,"" but this is a general statement, not a personal expression like ""I want to kill myself.""
   - Clear personal desire to die? Phrases like ""Life is useless"" and the belief in a better ""other side"" imply hopelessness and a preference for death over life, but they lack direct personal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die""). The normalization of suicide is societal advocacy, not self-referential suicidal intent. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned as unwanted or negated; instead, they are endorsed abstractly. However, ""Life is useless"" is a profound expression similar to ""life isn't worth it"" (which is classified under Ideation), indicating personal distress that leans toward ideation. No explicit negation of desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, guns), plan, intended action, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. The reference to suicide is vague and abstract (""normalized""), not tied to personal action. With no high imminence or intent, this does not elevate to Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). The content is entirely present-focused on feelings and beliefs, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows personal hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and a belief in death as preferable, which aligns with 'Ideation' due to profound expressions implying a desire for life to end (similar to ""life isn't worth it"" in the definition). However, the explicit mention of suicide is abstract/advocacy-based, not a current personal desire to act. There is no plan/method (ruling out Behavior) and no past action (ruling out Attempt). The absence of explicit personal suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"") creates some ambiguity, but strong negative sentiments like ""Life is useless"" are treated as Ideation per guidelines unless negated. Since thoughts are not stated as unwanted, and after careful consideration, the personal expression of hopelessness tips this to 'Ideation' over 'Indicator'.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses the concept of death as beautiful, emphasizing escape from pain (""never feel pain anymore""), avoidance of life's difficulties (""never deal with the hassle""), and a desire for oblivion (""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity""). It uses poetic language to romanticize death, such as ""to let go after holding on so tight,"" but does not explicitly mention suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., seeking relief from suffering), but no references to past actions, plans, methods, or imminence (e.g., no timeframes like ""tonight""). The focus is on the abstract appeal of death rather than a personal, current desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - While the post expresses that death is desirable as an escape, it does not include a clear, personal statement of the author's desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). The language is rhetorical and philosophical (e.g., ""Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?""), framing death as an abstract concept rather than a personal intention. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no element of unwanted thoughts being negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content remains conceptual, with no indication of planning or intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current, reflective thought about death with no reference to past or future actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of attempts or self-harm).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and romanticizes death as an escape, but it lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author. Phrases like ""never feel pain"" imply dissatisfaction with life, but they are not explicitly tied to the author's own wish to die (e.g., no first-person statements like ""I hate living""). Instead, the tone is abstract and rhetorical. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The ambiguity in personal desire (with no explicit suicidal ideation) aligns with 'Indicator', as the content discusses death abstractly without expressing the author's current wish to act on it.

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""i'll kill myself"" if COVID test is positive. Also references ""committing suicide"" and ""use any method I can as long as I don't see another day."" 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""my will to live... hanging by a thread""), isolation (""outcast,"" ""no one I can go to""), burden feelings. 
   - Plan/method: Directly links suicide to COVID-positive results, specifies intent to act (""I'll kill myself""), and mentions ""any method I can."" 
   - Imminence: Action is conditional on test results arriving ""tomorrow."" 
   - Desire: Explicitly states loss of fear of death and intent to die (""it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: ""kill myself,"" ""committing suicide,"" and ""I'll use any method... as long as I don't see another day"" are direct expressions of a genuine desire to die. No negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Method: Vague but actionable (""any method I can"") coupled with high intent/imminence (decision hinges on tomorrow's results). 
   - Preparation: None mentioned, but contextual imminence (tomorrow) and declared intent to act elevate this beyond ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes future intention (""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself""). No past initiated actions (only references past fear, not past attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation base) + conditional plan with method (""any method"") and high imminence (tomorrow) = **Behavior**. 
   - ""Any method"" is vague but implies actionable intent when combined with immediacy. 
   - No past initiated actions (Attempt not applicable). 
   - Strong desire rules out Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef"" explicitly. 
   - Refers to a specific method (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"") and states the outcome (""nothing""). 
   - Expresses hopelessness (""stop being a burden and a disappointment"") and isolation (""have nobody else"").
   - Describes a past self-initiated action (""took..."") and expresses ongoing desire to die (""what should i do kill mslef..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""kill mslef"" are used. The desire to die is unambiguous (e.g., ""stop being a burden"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Method explicitly described**: Overdosing on zopiclone (a sedative). 
   - **Preparation/action confirmed**: ""took an entire bottle"" indicates an initiated act. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a **past self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""took... and nothing""). This is a concrete attempt, regardless of recency. 
   - Current distress/ideation is present but secondary to the described action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is a **past suicide attempt** (ingesting a lethal dose of pills). 
   - Rules state: ""Attempt"" takes precedence if a past initiated action is described. 
   - Despite current pleas for help, the explicit description of the attempt (""took..."") categorizes this as 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions intense distress: ""Hell,"" ""lesser human,"" ""made fun of,"" ""pisses me off,"" ""navigate through Hell,"" ""don't belong in society.""
   - Explicit suicidal phrase: ""I might kill myself.""
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""I might kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent. No negation (e.g., ""but I won't"") or indication the thoughts are unwanted. Strong hopelessness (""don't belong in society"") reinforces desire to escape.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""after work""), or preparation (e.g., ""bought a rope"") mentioned. ""Might"" suggests contemplation, not imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Focuses on current emotional state and future possibility (""might kill myself""). No reference to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal intent). 
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*. 
   - No description of past initiated lethal action, so not *Attempt*. 
   - Clear suicidal ideation without actionable elements fits **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""end it""), death (""non existent""), and specific methods (taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and Advil). Emotional indicators like hopelessness are present (""struggling with depression""). There is a clear plan with specific substances (Tylenol and Advil) and high imminence (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""I'm going to end it,"" ""I will be non existent"") with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted. No past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""end it"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I will be non existent""). There is no statement negating or expressing distress about unwanted thoughts; instead, the desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (overdosing on Tylenol and Advil), and the action is intended imminently (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes""). This, combined with explicit intent, indicates planning and intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention with high imminence. No past initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned; the focus is on what the writer plans to do.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and a specific method with high imminence, fitting 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' because the desire to die is personal and not unwanted. It is not 'Ideation' because a method and intended action are specified. It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described.

237,"I can't remember what happened last year and it makes me so physically uncomfortable i want to kill myself. I just remember that I was really miserable. I couldnt stand being at home anymore, but for what reason? I cant fucking remember",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""i want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal desire. Emotional indicators include feeling ""so physically uncomfortable,"" ""really miserable,"" and frustration about not remembering past events (""I can't fucking remember""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The reference to last year describes past misery but not any suicidal actions or attempts. The desire to die is current and personal, with no explicit negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""i want to kill myself""), with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated. This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The expression ""i want to kill myself"" is a general statement of intent without details on how or when. There is no high imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""soon"") to suggest an implied plan. Thus, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""i want to kill myself"") and references past emotional states (""last year I was really miserable""), but there is no description of any past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). The mention of last year is about emotional distress, not a suicide attempt, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression ""i want to kill myself"" demonstrates a personal desire to die, fitting 'Ideation' (suicidal thoughts without a plan/method). It is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal thought is not explicitly unwanted or negated. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The lack of imminence or vagueness in intent does not elevate this to 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" ""deserve to die,"" ""failed attempt in October.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life wants me to kill myself,"" ""everything is shit""), self-loathing (""not deserving of love,"" ""deserve to suffer"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: Explicit plan to act on birthday (""end myself on my birthday in two weeks""), reference to past attempt (""failed attempt in October"").  
   - Imminence: Future action specified (""in two weeks"").  
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""I deserve to die,"" ""I will end myself"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" and ""deserve to die"" show unambiguous desire to die. No negation of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Future plan: Specific timeframe (""on my birthday in two weeks"") and implied preparation (past attempt context). Though method isn’t detailed, intent + imminence leans toward Behavior.  
   - Past action: ""Failed attempt in October"" is a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (key for Attempt).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past event: Describes a past suicide attempt (""failed attempt in October"") initiated by the author.  
   - Future intention: Plans to act in two weeks.  
   - **The past attempt is explicitly stated and linked to current feelings**, satisfying 'Attempt' criteria regardless of timeframe.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past attempt (""failed attempt in October"") takes precedence per rules: It’s a self-initiated, potentially lethal action described by the author in the context of their current state.  
   - Despite current ideation/plan (Behavior), 'Attempt' supersedes when a past action is clearly reported.

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""last suicide attempt"" explicitly, indicating a past self-initiated action. It also references ""suicidal thoughts"" that are now gone, and the author states they ""think about death but not about doing it."" Emotional indicators include positive feelings (""I feel really good,"" ""helped me almost completely""), relief from past depression, and gratitude for support. There is no mention of current plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions for suicide. The focus is on recovery and celebrating one month since the attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mentions: Yes, ""suicide attempt"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are directly stated.
   - Desire to die: Currently, no. The author emphasizes that suicidal thoughts have disappeared and they are not thinking about acting on thoughts of death. Phrases like ""think about death but not about doing it"" indicate a lack of current personal desire to die. Past intent is acknowledged but negated in the present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - For current/future: No specific method, plan, preparation, or intended action is mentioned. The only reference to method/action is in the past context of the attempt.
   - Past context: The ""suicide attempt"" implies a method was used, but it is not detailed. However, this is historical and not current behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past action: The author describes a ""last suicide attempt"" one month ago, which is a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This is clearly stated and initiated by the author.
   - Current state: No current ideation or behavior is present; the author reports the absence of suicidal thoughts and expresses positive emotions. The past attempt is mentioned in the context of current recovery (celebrating one month and thanking supporters).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""last suicide attempt"") by the author, which fits the 'Attempt' category definition: a self-initiated, potentially lethal action, regardless of when it occurred (here, one month ago). The author links this to their current state, reinforcing its relevance.
   - Current expressions like ""think about death but not about doing it"" suggest passive thoughts without desire or intent, which could lean toward 'Indicator', but the clear description of a past attempt takes precedence per the rules.
   - No current 'Ideation' (no desire to die expressed) or 'Behavior' (no plan/method/preparation for current/future actions). The rules state that 'Attempt' should be chosen if a past initiated action is described, even with current positive feelings.
   - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit, as it captures the historical action mentioned by the author.

I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I can't take it anymore""), despair (""drowning in these awful thoughts""), anhedonia (""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy""), and fear (""I'm so scared""). It mentions ""awful thoughts"" that could imply suicidal ideation but explicitly denies a plan to act (""I don't have a plan to hurt myself""). There are no references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm methods, or preparations. The phrase ""hurt myself"" is vague and not specified as suicidal. Timeframe references (e.g., ""today"") relate to general activities, not suicidal actions. The overall tone is one of distress and fear about unwanted thoughts, without expressing a genuine desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""I can't take it anymore"" suggests exhaustion but not a clear desire for death. Suicidal thoughts (""awful thoughts"") are implied, but the writer explicitly states fear and lack of plan, indicating these thoughts are unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die. Therefore, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The writer explicitly denies having a plan (""I don't have a plan to hurt myself""), and there is no indication of intended action, even if vague. Imminence is not discussed. With no plan/method and unwanted thoughts, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing distress (""I've been drowning"") and a recent non-suicidal action (""tried to go out of the house today""), but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress and unwanted thoughts but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent). Suicidal thoughts are implied but explicitly framed as frightening and not acted upon, fitting 'Indicator'. Ambiguous phrases like ""I can't take it anymore"" are not sufficient for 'Ideation' without explicit suicidal desire, especially given the negation of intent. No plan/method or past action supports ruling out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.

This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit expressions of desire to die: ""I want to die,"" ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I miss highschool,"" ""it's pathetic""), despair (""I don't wanna play video games... or eat anymore""), self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself,"" ""I'm literally a man baby"").  
   - Mentions of suicidal ideation: Constant thoughts of death, reference to not acting due to family impact (""I haven't died because of... your parents will be sad"").  
   - Self-harm imagery: ""imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself,"" but explicitly states no action (""I've never purposely hurt myself"").  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline (e.g., no tools, locations, dates).  
   - Past context: Hospitalization for depression (no mention of attempt), no description of initiated suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day"" show a personal desire to die. No negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While self-harm fantasies are present, they are explicitly unrealized (""never purposely hurt myself""). No references to suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No past/current action**. Describes intrusive thoughts and distress, but no initiated suicidal behavior (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Hospitalization is noted but not linked to an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The post expresses a persistent, explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and daily suicidal thoughts without ambiguity. The absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out ""Behavior."" Passive wishes (e.g., ""hopefully the roof collapses"") reinforce hopelessness but lack intent/action. Self-harm imagery is hypothetical and explicitly not acted upon, so it doesn’t elevate to ""Behavior."" No past suicidal actions are described, ruling out ""Attempt."" Distress is severe, but the personal desire to die is clear and not framed as unwanted thoughts, so ""Indicator"" does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses severe emotional and physical distress (""hurting,"" ""emotionally that it starts to hurt physically,"" ""depressed,"" ""muscles ache,"" ""exhausting,"" ""body giving up"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire for death: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight.""  
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Death is framed passively (""die in my sleep"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** The phrase ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight"" explicitly expresses a current, personal desire for life to end. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t actually want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No specific plan, method, or preparation.** Death is wished for passively (during sleep), with no indication of active means (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparatory steps (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Focuses on a *future hope* (""tonight""), not a past or recent action. No description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The explicit desire to die (""hoping I will die"") qualifies as **Ideation**, as there is no plan/method/preparation.  
   - Distinction from *Indicator*: Phrases like ""hoping I will die"" reflect a personal desire to end life, not abstract distress or unwanted thoughts.  
   - Distinction from *Behavior*: No actionable plan or method is mentioned.  
   - Distinction from *Attempt*: No past or recent self-initiated lethal action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""Zoloft overdose"" and details taking 6 pills (300mg) at a specific time (11:30).  
   - Emotional indicators include distress about the outcome (""wasn't enough to kill me"") and physical symptoms (nausea, sweating).  
   - A specific method (overdosing on Zoloft) and dosage are stated.  
   - The action is described as completed (""I took 6 pills""), indicating a past self-initiated act.  
   - The author expresses concern about potential consequences but no explicit negation of the desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Overdose"" in this context directly implies a suicidal act, especially coupled with ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" confirming lethal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes. A specific method (Zoloft overdose), dosage (300mg), and execution time (11:30) are provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""I took 6 pills""). The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms it was an attempt with a fatal intent.  
   - The action is recent (implied by current symptoms and the question about hospitalization).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is a description of a **past suicidal action** (overdose) initiated by the author, making 'Attempt' the primary category.  
   - Rules state: 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is described, regardless of current symptoms or time elapsed (here, very recent).  
   - While current distress is present, the historical action defines the classification.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: ""destined to do it"" (implies predetermined suicide), ""made my decision"" (resolved intent), ""calm about it,"" ""at peace knowing it's soon"" (imminence and emotional acceptance), ""Hope my plan works"" (explicit plan), ""no way I'm living"" (rejection of life).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""body that has clearly given up""), calm resignation.  
   - Explicit plan/method: ""Hope my plan works"" confirms a specific plan exists, though method isn't detailed.  
   - Imminence: ""soon"" indicates impending action.  
   - Desire: Strong personal wish to die (""no way I'm living"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""Destined to do it"" + rejection of life contextually means suicide. ""No way I'm living"" explicitly expresses desire to die. **Yes**.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., unwanted thoughts).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - ""Hope my plan works"" directly references a concrete plan. Combined with imminence (""soon"") and resolved intent (""made my decision""), this confirms **intended action**. **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""soon,"" ""plan works"")—no description of past initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** base).  
   - Specific plan mentioned with high imminence (""plan,"" ""soon"") → **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action described → Not **Attempt**.  
   - No ambiguity: Strong intent + plan outweighs unspecified method.

245,Hopeless. I've felt hopeless for months. I'm unemployed. At first I brushed it off due to the pandemic but now months later i realize it's me. I can deal with difficulties in life but realizing you're hopeless is too much. I don't want encouragement or people to tell me it will get better. I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""hopeless"" multiple times, indicating despair and emotional distress. It references long-term unemployment and personal inadequacy (""it's me""). The phrase ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum"" explicitly involves suicide but does not describe a personal desire to die, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. There are no mentions of death, dying, self-harm, methods, tools, locations, or timelines for action. The focus is on seeking a forum, which could imply distress or curiosity about suicide, but it's not a direct expression of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of a forum (Yes for mention), but it does not express a clear personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). The writer wants to find a suicide forum, which could relate to suicidal thoughts, but there is no explicit statement of wanting to act on those thoughts or a genuine wish for life to end. The thoughts are not stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""), but the primary sentiment is distress (hopelessness) rather than a declared intent. This leans toward ambiguity, but the lack of direct personal desire to die suggests Indicator.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. Wanting to find a forum is not a plan or preparation for suicide; it could be for information, support, or other reasons. With no explicit desire to die from Step 2, and no imminence or intent indicated, this does not suggest Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing feelings (""for months"") but no past, current, or future suicidal actions. There is no mention of any initiated self-harm or attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The desire to find a forum is a current intention but not a suicidal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (hopelessness) and abstractly discusses suicide through the forum reference, but there is no clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The mention of a suicide forum could imply suicidal thoughts, but without explicit personal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") or negation, and given the ambiguity after careful consideration, it aligns with Indicator. Phrases like ""hopeless"" are distress indicators but not equivalent to ""I hate living,"" which would be Ideation. With no plan, method, or action, and no past attempt, the category is Indicator. This fits the definition: distress and abstract suicide mention without personal suicidal intent.

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of self-harm/suicide: ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die,"" ""just want an end.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""disgusting to look at,"" ""how low my expectations,"" despair over unmet emotional need (""Why couldn't I get even that?"").
   - Specific method: ""slash my wrists"" (explicit means).
   - Imminence: ""on the verge of trying"" implies immediate intent.
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""die,"" ""just want an end"") without negation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""Slash my wrists and die"" directly references suicide. ""Just want an end"" confirms a personal desire for death. No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Specific method: ""slash my wrists"" is a clearly stated means.
   - Preparation/intent: ""on the verge of trying"" indicates imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes a future intention (""on the verge of trying""), not a past action. No reference to prior attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (""slash my wrists"") + imminent intent (""on the verge"") = **Behavior**. 
   - No past initiated action (rules out Attempt). Clear plan/method (rules out Ideation). Suicidal intent is personal and explicit (rules out Indicator).

That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""my life is not able to be fixed""), despair (rejecting the idea that ""life will get better"" as ""bullshit""), and a strong desire for death (""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone""). It includes a specific preparation (""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it""), indicating arrangements for after death. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns) or past actions, but the preparation is a forward-looking step. Imminence is not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""), but the desire is intense (""cannot wait""). The writer's stated desire is for death to end pain, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die with phrases like ""I cannot wait to die,"" which is a clear, current wish for life to end in the context of despair. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to""), so it is not unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator' and indicates at least 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned, the statement ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" is a clear sign of preparation for death. This implies intended action and planning, as arranging funeral costs is a practical step anticipating suicide. Coupled with the explicit desire to die, this preparation elevates the classification to 'Behavior'. The vagueness of the method is offset by the concrete preparatory action and strong intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (desire to die and preparing funeral costs) but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I cannot wait to die"") confirms 'Ideation' is present, but the mention of preparation (funeral costs) moves it to 'Behavior'. The preparation is a tangible step, aligning with the definition of 'Behavior' (expressions of suicidal desire with preparations). There is no ambiguity about the desire being personal and current, and the preparation indicates intent to act. No past actions suggest 'Attempt', and the lack of unwanted thoughts rules out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep hopelessness (""destined to live a depressed life,"" ""future being nowhere near as beautiful"") and anhedonia (""everything that made my happiness has now left me"").  
   - It questions life's purpose (""what's really the point?"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - The author seeks wisdom/support (""does anybody have some wisdom to share""), indicating distress but not intent to act.  
   - Phrases like ""summer of my life is over"" and ""perfect happiness"" reflect grief/loss, not suicidal desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Expressions of despair (""destined to live a depressed life"") imply hopelessness but **not a stated desire for death**. The rhetorical ""what's the point?"" questions meaning, not a wish to end life.  
   - **No mention of suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or actions related to self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **past happiness** and **current hopelessness** but **no past/current suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress about lost happiness and future despair**, falling under general psychological suffering.  
   - Lacks **personal desire to die**, **suicidal ideation**, or **behavioral cues**. The plea for ""wisdom"" reinforces a search for coping, not intent.  
   - Meets **Indicator** criteria: expresses hopelessness/loss without suicidal intent, ideation, or action. Phrases like ""what's the point?"" are existential but not inherently suicidal without explicit desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""jump from a bridge,"" which is a specific suicide method. It expresses a desire for death with phrases like ""highest chance of death"" and ""hopefully everything pans out the way I want,"" indicating a genuine wish to die. There is a clear plan and preparation: the author is researching bridges in NYC for lethality and intends to act ""by the weekend,"" showing high imminence. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I doubt anyone will answer me""), but the focus is on suicidal action. No past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide through the method ""jump from a bridge."" It expresses a clear desire to die, as seen in the pursuit of ""highest chance of death"" and the hopeful outcome for death. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the author is actively planning.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""jump from a bridge""), and the author is seeking details to choose the most lethal option. Preparations are implied by the research and the stated intention to ""pick one by the weekend,"" indicating imminent action. The high imminence and explicit intent support this.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""gonna pick one by the weekend"") with no mention of past actions. It is focused on planning and imminent behavior, not a completed or initiated act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) combined with a specific method (bridge jumping) and preparations (researching and selecting a bridge). The high imminence (""by the weekend"") confirms intended action. This fits 'Behavior' as there is a plan and method, but no past initiated action (which would be 'Attempt'). It is not 'Indicator' due to the clear suicidal desire, and not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan and method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being misunderstood, mistreated, and isolated (""My parents never understands me and they treat me like shit,"" ""I just need someone in my life who would see that I am trying""). It includes strong emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair (""I supposed to suffer,"" ""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen its grip,"" ""This is my destiny""). There is a sense of inevitability and worthlessness (""Do I deserve it?""). However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The phrase ""I will never die"" is used in the context of enduring eternal suffering, not as a desire for death. No references to past suicidal actions, plans, methods, preparations, or imminence of intent are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end. Phrases like ""I am here to live in pain"" and ""I will never die"" emphasize enduring suffering rather than seeking death. The overall sentiment is distress about life circumstances, not a wish for life to end. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication of unwanted thoughts being negated. The language leans toward hopelessness without suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention or implication of a specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide. No references to action, plans, or intended behaviors related to self-harm. The content is focused on emotional pain and perceived destiny, not actionable steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and beliefs (e.g., ""I am convinced,"" ""This is my destiny""), with no references to past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors. No timeframe for future actions is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and despair but lacks any explicit or implied personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, preparation, or past attempt. Phrases like ""I hate living"" (which would indicate Ideation) are absent; instead, the focus is on suffering as an inescapable fate. This fits the 'Indicator' category, as it expresses emotional turmoil without suicidal intent. There is no ambiguity suggesting Ideation (e.g., no expressions of wanting life to end), and no elements of Behavior or Attempt are present.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions sister's suicide (past event) and her past attempts.

   - **Past self-initiated action**: ""an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (initiated but failed).  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation mentioned.  
   - Protective factor: Staying alive for parents (""the idea of them losing two children... would break them"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Clear expressions of desire for life to end (e.g., ""welcome end,"" ""eternal sleep""). No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

   - Author links this to current state (""now I find myself in a different place"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **'Attempt' applies**: The post explicitly describes a past self-initiated suicidal action by the author.  
   - Rules state: ""**'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described**,"" even if historical or accompanied by current ideation.

Just to bring me back to nothing. No matter how hard I struggle, not matter how much I plan, in the end, it doesn't matter. There's not hope anymore. There's no joy anymore. There's no emotion anymore. No sadness, its just nothing. The pain in numb now, but that's nothing new. I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess. I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions hopelessness (""no hope anymore""), anhedonia (""no joy anymore""), and emotional numbness. 
   - Explicitly references a suicide method: ""I plan on doing it in the tub"" (method: drowning/water-related, location specified). 
   - Indicates preparation: ""there will be less of a mess"" (planning to minimize cleanup). 
   - Expresses farewell/apology: ""I'm sorry to those who cared about me,"" framing suicide as necessary (""for the best""). 
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""I plan on doing it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. ""Doing it"" implicitly references suicide (confirmed by context of despair, hopelessness, and farewell). The phrase ""it’s for the best"" confirms a desire for death as relief.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes. Specific method/location (""in the tub"") and practical preparation (""less of a mess"") are stated. High imminence is implied by definitive planning language (""I plan on"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a future intention (""I plan on doing it""), not a past action. No reference to prior attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Strong explicit desire to die + specific method (tub) + preparation (mess mitigation) = **Behavior**. 
   - Absence of past initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'. Unambiguous plan/method rules out 'Ideation'. No negation of suicidal desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") rules out 'Indicator'.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress (""I just want the pain to go away"") and a plea for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include pain and a desire for relief, but not hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, being a burden, or hating life. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. 
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no time frames like ""tonight""). 
   - The writer's stated desire is for the pain to end, not for life to end or to die; there is no expression of suicidal thoughts or intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no discussion of them being unwanted. 
   - The content focuses on distress and seeking support, not suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide or self-harm. 
   - No vague references implying action (e.g., ""make this pain physical"" is not present). 
   - Without explicit desire to die from Step 2, this step is irrelevant for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings, not past events or actions. 
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and a desire for pain relief but lacks a personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. 
   - It fits 'Indicator' because it expresses distress without explicit suicidal thoughts; phrases like ""want the pain to go away"" are vague and not suicidal. 
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' (requires explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (requires plan/method), or 'Attempt' (requires past action). 
   - Ambiguity is resolved in favor of 'Indicator' since suicidal desire is absent and not implied.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post begins with ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" explicitly referencing suicidal intent. Phrases like ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"" reinforce a personal desire for suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators are pervasive: hopelessness (""life is miserably unfair""), despair (""I failed miserably""), and trauma. 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timelines like ""tonight""). 
   - Past actions include misuse of painkillers/antidepressants, but this is framed as coping (""to cope with those racing thoughts"") and resulted in addiction/health issues—not explicitly as a suicide attempt. 
   - The author expresses a persistent desire to die (e.g., ""I wish I was good enough"") without negating this desire. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""END IT"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, and ""wanting to end it"" confirms personal intent. No disclaimers (e.g., unwanted thoughts) are present. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**: References to past medication misuse lack suicidal context (described as coping, not an attempt). No current plan, method, or imminent action is stated. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Past medication misuse is mentioned but framed as accidental self-harm/addiction, not an initiated suicide attempt (no phrases like ""tried to overdose""). 
   - Current suicidal desire is explicit but lacks actionable intent. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""END IT"") confirms **Ideation**. 
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
   - Past medication misuse is not described as a suicide attempt, ruling out **Attempt**. 
   - Lack of negation (""I don’t want to act on this"") disqualifies **Indicator**.

255,"I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts until my parents made me break up with my boyfriend. He was everything to me. I loved him so much. He was so perfect.

I really want to fucking kill myself. Not only did I lose my boyfriend, I lost the respect of my parents and I lost my respect for them. I have no one. I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back.

We both unfollowed each other on social media and deleted our conversations. He said he was crying. I felt like crying. I feel like cutting myself again. Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and specific methods: ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" 
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair (""Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything""), and references to self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again"").
   - A specific plan is described: running to the train station near the house to place her head on the tracks for a train to crush it. This includes a method (train) and location (train station), indicating preparation and intent.
   - There are references to past suicidal thoughts (""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"") and past self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again""), but no description of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt). The self-harm mention is not framed as a suicide attempt.
   - Imminence is implied through current thinking (""I'm thinking about"") but not specified with a timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I really want to fucking kill myself""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" and it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""let a train crush my head""). Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (train tracks) and location (train station near the house) are mentioned in relation to suicidal intent. The phrase ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station... and just let a train crush my head"" indicates a plan and intended action, even if not yet enacted. This, coupled with high intent (""I really want to""), supports classification as Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a future-oriented plan, but no past or recent initiated suicidal action. References to ""getting over suicidal thoughts"" and ""cutting myself again"" relate to past thoughts or self-harm, not a suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of an action like taking pills or hanging that was initiated).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out Indicator, as thoughts are not unwanted. The presence of a specific plan/method (train tracks) elevates this beyond Ideation to Behavior. There is no described past initiated lethal action for Attempt. Thus, Behavior is the best fit, as the post combines suicidal intent with a stated plan and method.

If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanted to die"" (daily for 4,808 days), ""suicide attempts"" (multiple, no regret), specific description of a ""successful attempt"" (saved by someone). 
   - Emotional indicators: Anger (""jealous and pissed""), hopelessness (""medication resilient major depressive disorder""), feeling trapped (""forced to live"").
   - Past actions: Clearly describes initiated suicide attempts (""had a few suicide attempts"").
   - Desire: Explicitly states personal desire to die (""I should be able to kill myself"") without negation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""wanted to die,"" ""suicide attempts,"" ""kill myself."" Desire is personal and unambiguously expressed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No current plan/method/preparation described. Focus is on **past attempts** and general desire.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions**: ""I had a few suicide attempts"" (initiated by the author). Timeframe (""a couple years back"") does not negate this, as the author links it to current feelings (jealousy, anger).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past suicide attempts (initiated actions) are explicitly stated. This meets the 'Attempt' definition regardless of when they occurred, as the author references them in the context of current struggles. Current expressions of desire (""wanted to die"") and anger reinforce the relevance of past actions. No current plan/method (Behavior) is mentioned.  
   - **'Attempt' takes precedence** because past suicidal actions by the author are described, even alongside ongoing ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""Trying to kill myself"" is stated multiple times, and there is a reference to a past attempt with ""I feel shame for failing,"" indicating an initiated action that did not result in death.
   - Emotional indicators include guilt, pain, anger, shame, hopelessness, and feelings of abandonment (e.g., ""I feel guilty for my family,"" ""I feel shame for failing,"" ""I'm such a fucking loser"").
   - Specific plans/methods are mentioned: The author states, ""I'm going to try again, but this time with a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off."" This implies a method has been considered, with contingencies noted, though the exact method is not specified.
   - Imminence is uncertain: ""I'm not sure exactly when, I think tomorrow maybe. But I don't know... Maybe tomorrow, maybe next week..."" This shows intent but variable timing.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and conveys a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a method is implied (""different method"") with characteristics described (easier, harder to back out of), and there is an intended future action (""I'm going to try again""). However, this is overshadowed by the clear description of a past action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes both a past event and future intentions. Specifically, ""I feel shame for failing"" indicates a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (a suicide attempt that failed). This is linked to the author's current state (shame, guilt) and future plans (""I'm going to try again"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal desire and future plans (Behavior), but the key element is the description of a past suicide attempt (""failing""), which is a self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
   - According to the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence if a past initiated action is clearly described by the author, even if current ideation or behavior is present. The historical attempt is mentioned in the context of current feelings, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.
   - This overrides the future-oriented Behavior elements, as the precedence rule applies.

I used to feel entertained and not in hell watching Judge Judy and Heidi Klum. Nope. I hate everything. No money will rot your brain. It's over. All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense distress (""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""in hell""), hopelessness (""It's over,"" ""No money will rot your brain""), and anhedonia (""Nothing to do,"" ""I used to feel entertained... Nope. I hate everything""). There is a direct reference to suicidal intent: ""All I want is courage to end it,"" which implies a personal desire to die. No specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., time, location), or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The phrase ""courage to end it"" suggests a lack of immediate action and focuses on the desire rather than implementation. There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in this context of despair. The statement ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a genuine personal desire to die or for life to end, reinforced by phrases like ""I hate everything"" and ""It's over."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. ""End it"" is vague and lacks any detail on how or when it would be carried out. The need for ""courage"" implies hesitation and no imminent action, so there is no evidence of planning, intended action, or preparation. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (""All I want is courage to end it"") and despair (""I hate everything,"" ""It's over"") qualifies as 'Ideation' because there is a clear personal wish to die, but no plan, method, or preparation. The lack of unwanted thought negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") rules out 'Indicator'. The absence of any action element rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. The vagueness of ""end it"" and the need for courage do not elevate this to 'Behavior' due to low imminence and no actionable details.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post specifies a date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours) for ""going out of this world,"" which is a euphemism for suicide. It includes explicit suicidal language (""offing myself"") and expresses a desire to die (""I'm not worth living""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and worthlessness. There is a specific plan with a timeframe (""at that time""), and it ends with a farewell (""Goodbye world""), indicating preparation. No past actions are described; the focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""offing myself,"" which is a direct phrase for suicide. It also expresses a clear desire to die through ""I'm going out of this world"" and ""I'm not worth living."" There is no negation of these thoughts or indication that they are unwanted; instead, they are stated as a firm intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific plan is indicated by the exact date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours) for the suicidal act. The phrase ""I'm offing myself then"" implies intended action, and ""Goodbye world"" suggests preparatory farewell. Although the method is vague (""offing myself"" doesn't specify means), the high imminence and specificity of the plan (tied to a personal milestone) indicate intended action, aligning with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going out... at that time"") with no mention of past or initiated actions. It is not a description of a historical attempt but a declaration of intent for a specific future moment. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan (time and date), meeting the criteria for 'Behavior'. It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the stated intention to act at a defined time, and it is not 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are not unwanted or ambiguous. 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past action is described. The high imminence and preparatory elements (e.g., farewell) further support 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""I don't want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefully,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""It will never be better""), despair (""I hate this world""), self-perceived burden (""I always lacked something""), and hatred toward societal/gender dynamics.  
   - Stated desire: Clear personal wish to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so bad"") with no negation of intent.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like acquiring means).  
   - No reference to past suicidal actions.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight""); focus is on persistent despair.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and ""I just want to die.""  
   - **Yes**: Strong expressions of desire to die (""I don't want to live,"" ""I hate this world"").  
   - **No**: Suicidal thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted/distressing but as genuine desires.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: While despair is extreme, no method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. Drinking is cited as coping, not a suicide method.  
   - Vague references to dying ""peacefully"" lack actionable context.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past actions**: Describes emotional history (rejections) but no initiated suicidal behaviors (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  
   - Focus is on current/future desire, not past acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong **explicit desire to die** qualifies for 'Ideation' or higher.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past self-initiated lethal action** rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I don't want to live"" confirm **personal suicidal intent**, excluding 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or abstract discussion).  
   - **Ambiguity check**: Desire is explicit and unnegated; no plan ambiguity exists.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being a burden (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me""), hopelessness (""I just can't do this anymore""), and distress about causing pain (""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause""). It ends with a statement of necessity (""I have to make it stop""), implying a desire to end the suffering. There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. No past actions or timeframes are referenced. The focus is on emotional pain and a perceived solution through absence, but without explicit suicidal language or details.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct statements of a desire to die are present. The phrase ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" strongly implies a belief that death would benefit others, and ""I have to make it stop"" suggests a wish to end the pain, which could indirectly indicate a desire for life to end. However, the desire is not explicitly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die""), and there is no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it""). Based on the guideline, strong expressions like ""I hate living"" are generally considered Ideation, but here, ""I just can't do this anymore"" is similar in conveying profound distress and a wish for relief, though less direct. After careful consideration, the suicidal intent is implied but not explicit, leading to ambiguity.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. ""Make it stop"" is vague and could refer to emotional cessation rather than a suicidal act. With no explicit desire to die from step 2 and no imminence (e.g., ""tonight""), this does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and a future-oriented necessity (""I have to make it stop"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows strong indicators of distress and hopelessness, with implications of suicidal ideation (e.g., ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" aligns with feeling like a burden, a common ideation theme). However, the lack of an explicit personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"") and the vagueness of ""make it stop"" create ambiguity. According to the guidelines, if suicidal desire is ambiguous and not explicitly unwanted after careful consideration, and there is no plan/action, it should be classified as Indicator. Phrases like ""I just can't do this anymore"" are distressing but not definitively suicidal; without clearer intent, this leans toward Indicator. Additionally, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation supports Indicator over Ideation. Ideation would require a clearer expression of wanting life to end (e.g., ""I wish I wasn't alive"").

I feel lost and alone and like no one understands me. I tried going to therapy but I couldn't bring myself to actually talk to him about how I feel because it hurts so much I can't even think about it anymore. I hate myself, I make mistakes and make it everyone's life progressively worse. I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this. I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital. Both would just make this living hell even more unbearable. Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but there lives would be better for it. They wouldn't have to try and care for me anymore. I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: feeling lost, alone, self-hatred (""I hate myself""), hopelessness (""nothing is better than this""), worthlessness (""I don't belong here""), and perceived burden (""everyone’s life progressively worse"").  
   - **Explicit suicide references**: ""I would have done it already,"" ""Everyone would feel sad if I did it,"" and ""ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital"" imply active consideration of suicide.  
   - **Method/plan indicators**: Fear of ""botching it"" (implying consideration of methods) and consequences (physical harm/hospitalization). No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is named, but the phrasing suggests evaluation of outcomes.  
   - **Temporal context**: Current crisis (""I’m on the edge"") with stated barriers to action (fear of survival), but no description of past initiated suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I would have done it already"" and ""if I did it"" confirm a personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Indirect method reference**: ""Botching it"" implies contemplation of methods and their risks. Coupled with high imminence (""I’m on the edge,"" ""I would have done it already"") and intent, this elevates risk.  
   - **No explicit plan/preparations** (e.g., notes, acquired means), but the barrier (fear) indicates active weighing of actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** (""I would have done it already if..."") but **no past initiated action** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die (""would have done it"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past self-initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Strong desire to die is present. The phrase ""botching it"" implies consideration of methods/outcomes, and high imminence (""on the edge"") + intent (""would have done it"") supports **Behavior** despite vague method reference.

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields.

This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide/death: The post includes phrases like ""not wanting to live,"" ""more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" and explicit admission: ""I would say I'm suicidal."" It also expresses strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""glass being empty,"" ""no success,"" ""failure,"" ""waste of space,"" ""serve no purpose but only suffer"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, means acquisition) is mentioned. The reference to waiting until the son is an adult (""11 more years"") implies a distant, non-imminent intention without details on how it would be carried out.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts or self-initiated actions. The depression is historical, but no suicidal actions are referenced.
   - Imminence: The stated intention (""wait till he's an adult"") is not imminent; it is deferred for years.
   - Desire assessment: The author expresses a genuine personal desire to die (e.g., ""not wanting to live,"" ""suicidal"") but explicitly negates acting on it due to lack of courage (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") and concern for his son (""my son doesn't deserve that""). This indicates the suicidal thoughts are unwanted in terms of action, but the underlying desire is present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and includes clear expressions of desire to die (e.g., ""not wanting to live,"" ""leaving this life""). Although action is negated, the personal desire for death is not explicitly rejected—only the act is.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The future intention is vague and lacks any actionable details. The context (deferred timeline, no method) does not support a plan or imminent behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and future thoughts but no past actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts), only ideation and distress.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""not wanting to live""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. The negation (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") addresses action, not the underlying desire, and thus does not shift it to 'Indicator' (which requires thoughts to be explicitly unwanted with no personal desire to die). No plan/method/preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""struggling to hold on"" (emotional distress), ""depressed and feeling like shit for years"" (hopelessness, despair), and **""I just want off this life""** (explicit desire to end life).  
   - No references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, locations, or tools.  
   - No description of past suicide actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  
   - No explicit negation of suicidal desire (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don’t want to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I just want off this life"" is a direct expression of a desire to end life, equivalent to ""I wish I weren’t alive.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current/persistent feelings (""for years"") but **no description of past initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""want off this life"") with no plan/method/preparation. Strong emotional despair (""struggling to hold on,"" ""feeling like shit"") supports suicidal ideation.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire is personal and not negated/unwanted.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, or past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I need to kill myself"" directly states suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""life just isn't worth it""), anhedonia (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), and guilt about burdening others.  
   - Specific plan/method: No method, tools, location, or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned. The question about minimizing harm shows ambivalence but **does not** indicate preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).  
   - Imminence: No timeframe (e.g., ""now,"" ""soon"") is specified.  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""I need to kill myself,"" ""life just isn't worth it"") with **no negation** of the desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases (""kill myself"") and clear desire to die (""life just isn't worth it"") are present. Guilt about impact on others does **not** negate the expressed wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: While the post asks ""how to minimise hurt,"" this focuses on consequences, **not** on planning the act itself (e.g., no method, tools, or steps to execute suicide).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past/initiated actions**: Describes current ideation and distress but **no reference** to past attempts or actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not unwanted/distress-only (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent implied.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I'll be gone"" (implies death/disappearance) and ""no possible way to turn my life around"" (hopelessness).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of fighting,"" ""depression,"" ""can't escape"" (despair, anhedonia).  
   - Temporal context: ""By this time next week"" specifies imminence.  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, means) mentioned.  
   - Expresses a desire for life to end but no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""I'll be gone"" strongly implies a desire to die/not exist. No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" but clear intent.  
   - No statement rejecting suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Imminent timeframe (""next week"") but no method (e.g., tools, location) or preparations described.  
   - Vague action (""be gone"") without specifying *how*, despite high imminence/intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Future intention (""next week""), no past actions (e.g., ""tried to"") described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""another attempt,"" which directly references a past suicide attempt initiated by the author. It expresses a strong desire to die (""I just want to die"") and hopelessness about surviving future attempts due to parental criticism. Emotional indicators include despair (e.g., not wanting to hear parents again) and a genuine wish for death. There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned for a future attempt; the focus is on the aftermath of a past action and the desire for death without recurrence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""I hope I don't make it"" (in the context of surviving an attempt). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the language conveys a personal and current wish for life to end.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation for a future suicidal act is mentioned. The reference to ""another attempt"" pertains to a past event, not current planning. While there is a conditional statement about not surviving ""another attempt,"" it does not imply a new plan or imminent action—only a desire for death if an attempt occurs.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action: ""another attempt"" indicates the author has previously attempted suicide. This is stated in the context of current feelings (e.g., not wanting to survive if it happens again and wanting to die). The rules state that 'Attempt' applies if a past action is clearly described by the author, regardless of when it occurred, especially when linked to current distress.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""), which meets the 'Attempt' definition (a self-initiated, potentially lethal action). The author also expresses current suicidal ideation (""I just want to die""), but 'Attempt' takes precedence because the past action is explicitly mentioned and central to the narrative. There is no evidence of current planning or preparation for a new attempt, ruling out 'Behavior.' The desire to die is explicit and not unwanted, so it is not 'Indicator.' The presence of the past attempt distinguishes this from 'Ideation.'

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head"" and ""death is the only escape.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""too far gone,"" ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life,"" intense and escalating thoughts, despair about lack of support.
   - Explicitly references **current, persistent suicidal thoughts** but no specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, notes, or imminent actions like ""tonight"").
   - No description of past actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").
   - Desire to escape life via death is clearly stated (""death is the only escape""), with no negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - **Yes**: Expresses desire for death as escape (""death is the only escape"").
   - No indication thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are intensifying.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at the bridge""), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. ""Death is the only escape"" is abstract, not actionable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **current/future** thoughts (e.g., ""as the days pass,"" ""wake immediately with suicidal thoughts"").
   - **No** mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried,"" ""I took pills"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""death is the only escape"") and ""suicidal thoughts"" confirm **Ideation**. No ambiguity—thoughts are not framed as unwanted.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation described. ""Death is the only escape"" is a general desire, not a plan. No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") to imply action.
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no past/current initiated actions.
   - **Conclusion**: Strong suicidal ideation without plan/method → **Ideation**.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past ""vaguely suicidal stuff"" and two specific events.  
   - First event: Testing a method (went to ""point of no return"" but stopped). Explicitly states it was **not** an attempt.  
   - Second event: Went in ""with the intention of dying"" but stopped due to lack of courage.  
   - Both events occurred ""long enough ago,"" and the user feels ""separated"" from them.  
   - No current suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or preparations described. Current focus is retrospective distress about classifying past actions.  
   - Emotional tone: Distressed about past ambiguity (""bothering me""), not current hopelessness/desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit **current** desire to die. Discusses **past** intent (""intention of dying"" in second event).  
   - Current language reflects distress about unresolved feelings (""weighing on me""), not active suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Past methods implied (e.g., ""testing my method,"" ""point of no return"") but not detailed.  
   - **No current plan, method, or preparation mentioned.** Focus is entirely on historical actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past self-initiated actions**:  
     - First action: Testing method (non-attempt).  
     - **Second action: Explicit intent to die + initiated potentially lethal action (""went in with the intention of dying,"" stopped before completion).**  
   - Timeframe: Both events occurred in the past (""long enough ago"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The second event meets 'Attempt' criteria: Self-initiated, potentially lethal action with explicit intent to die (""intention of dying"").  
   - Historical nature doesn't disqualify it (rules: ""past actions... mentioned in context of current feelings"").  
   - No current ideation/behavior described (e.g., ""I’m in a tenuously better situation"").  
   - Distress is about classifying past events, not expressing current desire to die/plan.  
   - **'Attempt' takes precedence** because a past initiated suicidal action is clearly described.

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""nothing ever gets better,"" ""I will never achieve my goals""), despair (""I really want to die""), worthlessness (""I probably deserve to suffer""), and trauma from past abuse (bullying, parental beatings). It includes explicit personal expressions of wanting to die (""I really want to die"") and dissatisfaction with life (""I hate living"" is implied in the tone). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or intended actions. References to past events focus on childhood experiences and interpersonal harm (e.g., being bullied or bullying others), not self-initiated suicidal actions. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"" for acting on thoughts). The desire to die is stated directly and personally, with no explicit negation (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I really want to die,"" which is a clear personal expression of desire for death. Phrases like ""So what do I have to live for?"" and the overall context of despair reinforce suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""I don't actually want to die""). Thus, this is not 'Indicator'; it indicates genuine suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The post discusses emotional pain and anger (e.g., ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" is metaphorical, not literal, and ""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself"" refers to harming others, not self-harm). There is no implied plan or intended action, even vaguely, and no imminence. With explicit desire but no actionable elements, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past experiences (e.g., childhood trauma, bullying) and current feelings of despair, but it does not describe any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, such as ""I tried to kill myself""). All suicidal expressions are about current thoughts or desires, not actions. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit personal desire to die (""I really want to die"") without any plan, method, preparation, or past action places this in 'Ideation'. The strong hopelessness and life dissatisfaction support this, but the lack of actionable elements rules out 'Behavior'. 'Indicator' is inappropriate because the suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted, and 'Attempt' is absent due to no described past actions. Ambiguity is low: the desire is clear and personal, but no behavioral elements exist.

   - Mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and ""looking up how to do it"" explicitly.
   - Expresses extreme hopelessness (""depression made a great life into a fucking hell,"" ""never ending pit"").
   - Desires death: ""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself so this nightmare could all be over.""
   - Specifies methods (jumping in front of a car, stabbing self) and implies preparation (""looking up how to do it"").
   - No past actions described; focuses on current/future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and directly states a desire to die (""wish i had the courage to jump... or stab myself... so this nightmare could all be over""). No negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (jumping in front of a car, stabbing self) are named. Preparation is indicated by ""looking up how to do it.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current suicidal thoughts and research. No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** base) + specific methods/preparation (**Behavior** requirement). No past initiated action rules out **Attempt**. Strong intent and methods confirm **Behavior** over Ideation. Distress is coupled with actionable intent, not abstract/unwanted thoughts (**Indicator**).
   - Final: **Behavior** (suicidal desire + plan/method/preparation).

272,"Nothing Is Beautiful. I don't want to be here anymore. People always say life is great, life is a blessing but I'm so fucking done with this shit. I want out so bad.

You can't trust anyone because no matter what they say you know deep down at some point they're going to leave you. My ex told me 'let's promise to each other that no matter what we'll always work through our problems' but guess you left as soon as things got tough. She did. I can't trust anyone, the second I do I get burned. I'm so fucking stupid. Fuck the entire human race. I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all. If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense despair, hopelessness, and a desire to escape life (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I hate this so much""). It includes general dissatisfaction with life, betrayal, and a wish for mass death (e.g., ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all""). However, there are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The emotional indicators are strong (hopelessness, feeling like a failure, distrust), but the focus is on a passive wish for collective death rather than personal action. No timeframe or imminence is indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire for personal escape is clear, but it is not explicitly linked to self-harm or suicide methods.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide: No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.
   - Clear desire to die: Yes, phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" and ""I want to leave and never come back"" express a personal desire for life to end, implying suicidal ideation. The nuclear bomb wish is a generalized expression of despair but does not negate the personal intent in other statements. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die""), so the desire appears genuine.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - Despite high emotional intensity and desire to die, there is no reference to personal action, plan, or method. The nuclear bomb scenario is hypothetical and external, not a plan for self-initiated action. With no plan/method and no imminence, this does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). References to past events (e.g., the ex leaving) are contextual but not related to self-harm. No initiated actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to leave and never come back""), which aligns with Ideation. Phrases like ""I hate this so much"" and ""I don't want to be here anymore"" are strong indicators of suicidal thoughts without being explicitly unwanted, so this is not Indicator.
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or intended action, ruling out Behavior.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out Attempt.
   - Therefore, the best fit is Ideation, as it involves clear expressions of suicidal desire without any plan, method, or action.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions death and dying (""It will all be done after I die""), a clear desire to die (""I want to die""), and a specific method (""pull the trigger"" implying suicide by firearm). Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair due to racial pressure. The phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" indicates an intended action with high imminence, as it suggests immediate or near-future execution. The reference to police (""if a cop doesn't do it first"") does not negate the personal intent to act; instead, it underscores the immediacy and context of the suicidal plan. There is no mention of past actions or preparations, only current/future intention. The desire to die is personal, explicit, and not stated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger,"" which directly indicates suicidal intent. The desire to die is genuine and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger"" refers to using a firearm for suicide. This is coupled with high imminence and intent (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), implying an intended action. No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun) are stated, but the clear method and intent are sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) and a specific method/plan (""pull the trigger""), fitting 'Behavior'. It does not meet 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are not unwanted; 'Ideation' is insufficient due to the method and intent; and 'Attempt' is inapplicable as no past action is described. The high imminence and specificity of the method confirm 'Behavior'.

I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") as a past action.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").
   - Describes emotional pain and exhaustion (""tired of putting a mask on,"" ""sleeping is really hard"").
   - No explicit mention of suicide methods, plans, or preparations.
   - No timeframe for future suicidal action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
   - The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" implies a desire to escape via death but lacks concrete suicidal intent or planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: The statement ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a clear desire for death as relief, indicating active suicidal ideation. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: Past self-harm is mentioned (""hurt myself two months ago""), but this is not framed as a suicide attempt (no lethal intent/method described). No current plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Self-harm occurred two months ago and is described as non-lethal (""hurt myself""). It is not presented as a past suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of intent to die). No current/initiated lethal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit desire for death (""Death seems like the only place..."") confirms **Ideation**. While distress and self-harm history are present, the absence of unwanted suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts"") rules out Indicator.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan, method, or imminent action is mentioned, ruling out Behavior.
   - **Attempt**: The past self-harm lacks context as a suicide attempt (no lethal intent/method), so it does not qualify as an Attempt.

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling ""more suicidal"" daily, thinking about suicide every day, and writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (e.g., ""still am the same person with the same head,"" ""it's been like this for seven years"") and isolation.  
   - Explicitly states, ""I know I would never do it,"" linking this to fear of hell and hospitalization.  
   - Desires help but fears consequences (hospitalization/financial burden).  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations for imminent action are mentioned. The ""detailed plans"" are confined to journaling, with no indication of acting on them.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned (""more suicidal,"" ""think about suicide every day"").  
   - **However**, the desire to act is explicitly negated: ""I know I would never do it"" due to fear of hell/hospitalization. This frames the thoughts as *unwanted* and not representing a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Journaling about ""detailed plans"" indicates internal processing but **no actionable plan, method, or preparation** (e.g., no tools, timeline, or intent to execute). The phrase ""I would never do it"" negates any imminent risk.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts/feelings (e.g., ""every day,"" ""seven years"") but **no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions**. Journaling is a coping mechanism, not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly stated as unwanted and not acted upon (""never do it"").  
   - No plan/method/preparation for action exists beyond journaling, which lacks imminence or intent.  
   - Strong emotional distress (hopelessness, isolation) aligns with **Indicator**, as the core sentiment is distress about *unwanted* thoughts and a desire for help, not a genuine wish to die.  
   - Rules out 'Ideation' due to explicit negation of desire; rules out 'Behavior'/'Attempt' due to absence of plan/action.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress with phrases like ""I cant take it anymore"" and ""The pain is unreal,"" indicating hopelessness and despair. There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The timeframe is not specified, and there is no indication of imminence. The writer focuses on unbearable pain but does not express a personal desire to die or for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end is expressed (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die"" are absent). The statement ""I cant take it anymore"" conveys distress but not an explicit wish for death (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply.
   - Conclusion: Lacks explicit suicidal intent, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or actions).
   - Without explicit desire to die from step 2, this step is not applicable.
   - Conclusion: No elements of plan or behavior present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings of distress but no past, present, or future actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").
   - Conclusion: No evidence of past or recent attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but no personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plan, method, or action. Phrases like ""I cant take it anymore"" suggest severe emotional pain but, without explicit suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""), it aligns with 'Indicator'. 
   - There is ambiguity about suicidal desire, but after careful consideration, the lack of explicit or implied suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I hate living"" or similar) supports 'Indicator'. 
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is no desire to die expressed; not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' due to absence of plan, method, or action.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide"" directly, indicating a focus on suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The tone suggests a sense of capability or resignation (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober""), but there is no explicit expression of hopelessness, despair, or being a burden. The attribution to ""Higher Power in action"" from AA (Alcoholics Anonymous) adds context but does not convey emotional distress about the thoughts.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The statement is about capability, not intention or action.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., attempts) or timeframes (e.g., ""yesterday,"" ""soon"").
   - Imminence: There is no indication of when this capability might be acted upon (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Stated desire: The writer expresses capability (""I think I'm capable"") but not a clear, current desire to die or for life to end. There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") or expression of distress about them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide,"" which is a direct phrase.
   - However, it does not express a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""life isn't worth it""). Instead, it focuses on the ability to commit suicide while sober.
   - Suicidal thoughts are implied through capability, but they are not stated as unwanted or distressing. The lack of explicit negation or personal desire makes this lean away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or plan (e.g., how, when, where) is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present.
   - Despite the explicit mention of suicide, the context is about capability rather than intention or imminent action. Therefore, no elements of 'Behavior' are identified.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current state of mind (""I think I'm capable"") with no reference to past or future actions.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., an attempt) is present. The focus is on potential ability, not behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide personally (""I'm capable of commiting suicide""), which goes beyond general distress or abstract discussion, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - However, there is no expression of a genuine desire to die, no plan/method, and no preparation. The capability statement implies ideation but is not coupled with intent or action.
   - Compared to 'Indicator': This is not merely general distress or unwanted thoughts, as the thoughts are not negated or expressed with distress. Phrases like ""capable of commiting suicide"" are explicit and personal, leaning toward 'Ideation'.
   - Compared to 'Behavior': No plan, method, or intended action is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria.
   - Compared to 'Attempt': No past or recent initiated action is described.
   - Ambiguity: The lack of desire is noted, but explicit suicidal thoughts (capability) without negation or plan fall under 'Ideation'. The reasoning is that ""capable of commiting suicide"" constitutes an expression of suicidal ideation, as it personalizes and acknowledges the possibility of suicide.

Final classification: 'Ideation' due to explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts without a plan, method, or explicit negation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The user expresses intense despair (""I hate every part of my life,"" ""sick and tired""), self-loathing (""piece of shit""), isolation (""don't want to be alone anymore""), and explicitly states a desire for life to end (""I just want it to be over,"" ""I want to be done"" [likely typo for ""gone""]). No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are mentioned. Temporal context is present-focused (""anymore,"" ""want to be done now"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. Phrases like ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be done"" directly express a personal desire for life to end. No negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I won't act"") is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No. The post lacks references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The distress is emotional, with no actionable plan implied.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions described. The focus is on current emotional suffering and desire to escape life.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""want it to be over"") qualifies as **Ideation**. Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out Behavior. Lack of past suicidal actions rules out Attempt. Strong expressions like ""I hate every part of my life"" confirm personal suicidal desire, disqualifying Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" confirming past self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - It expresses future intent (""I will use my suicide"") and a desire to die for personal satisfaction, coupled with hostility toward capitalism.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation details are mentioned for the future suicide.  
   - Emotional tone includes resentment and a declared role as an ""existential terrorist.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""suicide"" is directly mentioned, and ""I will use my suicide"" confirms a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Future intent (""I will use my suicide"") lacks specifics about method, plan, or preparation. No tools, locations, or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key element**: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" clearly describes past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author. This is a historical account linked to their current mindset.  
   - Future suicidal intent (""I will use my suicide"") is declared but lacks actionable details.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **'Attempt' takes precedence** because the author explicitly describes past suicidal actions they initiated (""attempted suicide 11 times""). The historical nature (no timeframe given) doesn't disqualify it, as the author connects it to their current identity and intentions.  
   - While future intent suggests 'Behavior', the absence of plan/method/preparation specifics and the **explicit mention of past attempts** prioritizes 'Attempt' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness: ""Welcome to the bottom of hell,"" ""given up completely,"" ""I just want the pain to end.""  
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation described (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timeline).  
   - Focuses on emotional pain and consequences of life events (breakup, job loss, isolation).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - ""Tried to kill myself 3 times"" is a definitive description of **past initiated suicidal actions**, meeting the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - Current statements (""want the pain to end"") indicate ongoing distress/ideation but do **not** override the clear evidence of past attempts.  
   - Rules state: **'Attempt' takes precedence if past actions are described**, regardless of historical timing or current ideation.  
   - No current plan/method/preparation, so 'Behavior' is not applicable.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The post includes explicit discussions of suicide methods (e.g., shotgun to the head, handguns through the upper palate, overdose) and fears of failed suicide leading to paralysis. Phrases like ""accomplish death,"" ""shooting myself,"" and ""End it now"" indicate personal engagement with suicidal actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I am in hell,"" ""it doesn't get better,"" ""no miracle is coming""), despair (""I'm so alone,"" ""depression and physical pain""), and feelings of isolation/inability to connect.
   - Specific plans/methods: Detailed consideration of methods (e.g., firearm types, overdose risks) and research into options (""I've looked into other options""). However, no explicit statement of immediate preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) or imminent action plan.
   - Imminence: While ""End it now"" suggests urgency, it is directed at a general ""you"" (reader) rather than a personal declaration of intent. The author expresses fear and hesitation about methods, reducing immediacy.
   - Past actions: No mention of past suicide attempts by the author; references to Mark Linkous are about another person.
   - Stated desire: Clear personal desire to die is expressed through phrases like ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"" and the endorsement of suicide (""End it now"") in the context of the author's pain. There is no explicit negation (e.g., ""I don't want to die""), only fear of consequences.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post includes explicit personal expressions related to suicide, such as ""shooting myself"" and ""accomplish death."" The phrase ""End it now,"" while generalized, reflects the author's own desire in context. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not representative of a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are discussed in detail (firearms with caliber considerations, overdose risks). Additionally, the author mentions researching options (""I've looked into other options""), which constitutes preparation. Coupled with explicit desire to die, this indicates behavioral elements, even though imminence is low due to fear.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (fears and considerations about methods) but no past or recent self-initiated actions by the author. References to Mark Linkous are not personal.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Ruled out 'Indicator' due to explicit personal desire to die without negation.
   - Ruled out 'Attempt' as no past initiated action is described.
   - Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior': The detailed method discussion and research (""looked into"") go beyond mere thoughts and indicate planning/preparation, fitting 'Behavior'. Although there is fear and no high imminence, the presence of method-specific content and preparation aligns with the 'Behavior' definition.

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress with phrases like ""Can't do any of it!"" (indicating hopelessness or feeling overwhelmed) and ""don't want this anymore"" (suggesting despair or dissatisfaction with life). The core statement ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a strong metaphorical expression of a desire for permanent escape or death.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: No explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or specific methods (e.g., pills, cutting). The language is indirect but implies death through the metaphor of eternal sleep.
   - Emotional indicators: Clear hopelessness (""Can't do any of it!""), despair (""don't want this anymore""), and anhedonia (lack of desire to engage with life).
   - Plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or actions taken.
   - Past actions: None described.
   - Imminence: No time frame (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the desire is general.
   - Writer's desire: The phrase ""never ever wake up"" indicates a personal wish for life to end, not distress about unwanted thoughts. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") to suggest the thoughts are intrusive or undesired.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide/death? **No** (no direct terms like ""suicide"").
   - Clear desire to die? **Yes**. ""Just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" is a strong, personal expression of wanting life to end, similar to ""I hate living"" or ""I wish I could disappear."" This is not abstract or unwanted; it conveys a genuine wish for non-existence.
   - Unwanted thoughts? **No**. The writer does not state that these thoughts are intrusive or contrary to their will (e.g., no ""but I don't want to act on it"").
   - Conclusion: Leaning toward 'Ideation' due to the personal desire for death, not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method mentioned? **No**. The metaphor of ""sleep and never wake up"" is vague and does not imply a concrete plan (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, or locations).
   - Signs of preparation? **No**. No mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or other actions.
   - Imminence/intent: No high imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or intent to act described. The statement is a wish, not a plan.
   - Conclusion: No elements of plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current/future intention? Yes, a present desire (""wanna sleep"") but no action.
   - Past initiated actions? **No**. No references to attempts (e.g., ""I tried,"" ""I took pills"").
   - Conclusion: No 'Attempt' elements.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a personal desire to die (""never ever wake up"") without a plan, method, or preparation, fitting 'Ideation'.
   - Not 'Indicator': The desire is personal and not negated; phrases like ""don't want this anymore"" and ""never wake up"" imply suicidal ideation, not just general distress. Explicitly unwanted thoughts are absent.
   - Not 'Behavior': No plan or intended action is mentioned, even considering the metaphor's vagueness.
   - Not 'Attempt': No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.
   - Ambiguity resolution: Strong expressions of wanting life to end are 'Ideation' unless negated. Here, no negation, so 'Ideation' is clear.

283,"I want to die but I'm scared. I'm so tired of everything. Tired of pretending, tired of lying, tied of being scared. Tired of everything. What's the point. I want to die but I'm scared. Can someone please help me work out what to do.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" multiple times, indicating a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""What's the point""), despair (""tired of everything""), and fear (""I'm scared""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The writer asks for help to ""work out what to do,"" suggesting ambivalence but not negating the desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to die."" This is a clear personal expression of suicidal intent. The mention of fear (""I'm scared"") and the plea for help do not explicitly negate or state that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., it does not say ""I don't want these thoughts""). Therefore, this aligns with suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The phrase ""work out what to do"" is vague and, in context, refers to seeking help or alternatives, not indicating a plan or intended action for suicide. Without any reference to a method, plan, or imminent action, this does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm so tired"") with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, self-harm, or initiated behaviors). Therefore, Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die""), which qualifies as Ideation according to the definition (personal desire to not be alive without a plan or method). The emotional distress and fear do not shift this to Indicator because the suicidal desire is personally expressed and not explicitly negated as unwanted. There is no evidence of plan/method (Behavior) or past action (Attempt). Thus, the best fit is Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times and includes emotional distress indicators like ""I am not ok,"" ""I cry about it,"" ""I feel so hopeless,"" ""I will never be ok,"" and ""I will just suffer till I end it."" There is a clear expression of a plan: ""I have a plan,"" with specifics such as knowing where to attempt, how to do it, what is needed, and timing details (""It must be a Tuesday to run away""). The desire to end life is present, but there is ambivalence (""idk if I should do it""). No past actions are described; all content is focused on current thoughts and future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and phrases like ""end it,"" which directly express a personal desire to die. While there is distress and crying, the thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""I don't want to die""). Instead, the phrase ""I will just suffer till I end it"" confirms a genuine desire for life to end. This rules out 'Indicator' and points to suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, the author mentions having a plan and provides specific elements: knowledge of location (""I know where I'll attempt""), method (""I know how""), means (""I know what I need""), and timing (""how and when I can run away from home,"" specifically ""a Tuesday""). This indicates detailed planning and preparation. Even with some ambivalence (""idk if I should do it""), the presence of a concrete plan and imminent action (e.g., ""till I end it"" with a specific day) supports 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and future intentions (""I will just suffer till I end it""), but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). All references to action are prospective, so this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (Ideation level) but goes beyond thoughts by detailing a plan, method, and preparations. This meets the 'Behavior' definition. The ambivalence does not negate the presence of a plan, and there is no past action for 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post includes expressions like ""make me want to die,"" ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me,"" ""I almost hope something bad happens to me,"" ""spending time here makes me want to not exist,"" ""I want to disappear,"" and ""I do not want to exist anymore."" These indicate profound hopelessness, despair, and an explicit desire to end life.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""I can't see a solution""), anger, guilt, and isolation (""I have no one else"").  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: Mentions ""fighting the urge to go wandering off into the night"" due to apathy about self-harm, but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is described. The ""wandering off"" is vague and lacks imminence or concrete suicidal action.  
   - **Past Actions**: No references to past suicide attempts or self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Imminence**: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - **Desire**: Explicit personal wish to cease existing (e.g., ""I do not want to exist anymore""), with no negation of this desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""want to die,"" ""want to not exist,"" and ""I do not want to exist anymore"" indicate a **clear personal desire to die** (Yes). Thoughts are **not** framed as unwanted (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). ""Wandering off into the night"" implies risk-taking but lacks a concrete suicidal plan/method. Coupled with low imminence (""right now"" is contextual despair, not a timeline), this falls short of 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current** distress and ideation. **No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I do not want to exist"") and absence of unwanted-thought disclaimers confirm 'Ideation' (not 'Indicator').  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned; vague references to ""wandering off"" lack suicidal specificity.  
   - **Attempt**: No described past/current actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong expressions of desire to die without plan/method → **Ideation**.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""ideations of suicide,"" ""everyday I'm battling to stay alive,"" ""most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" ""people/the world would be better off without me.""

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""thinking about killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It expresses emotional distress, including loneliness, hopelessness (""I'm starting to believe I never will [have friends]""), despair (""I can't take this anymore""), and feelings of worthlessness (""What the fuck is wrong with me?""). 
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, guns, notes, or giving things away). 
   - No past suicidal actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings. 
   - Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the suicidal thought is presented as ongoing but conditional on loneliness. 
   - The writer's desire: The phrase ""if I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself"" suggests the suicidal thoughts are tied to circumstances but does not explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted or that there is no genuine desire to die (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal thoughts. 
   - The expression ""I can't take this anymore"" implies a desire for relief, which could include death, but it is not as explicit as ""I want to die."" However, ""thinking about killing myself"" constitutes an explicit personal expression of suicidal ideation. 
   - The writer does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them (e.g., no ""I don't actually want to die""). The conditional ""if"" statement implies the thoughts might lessen with changed circumstances but does not negate the current presence of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned or implied. 
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are present. 
   - Despite the strong emotional distress and explicit suicidal thoughts, there is no indication of a plan, intended action, or high imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and suicidal thoughts; it does not reference any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). 
   - All content is about present ideation, not historical or recent attempts. Thus, Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of ""killing myself"" confirms suicidal thoughts, placing this above Indicator (which requires no clear personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). 
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or imminent action, ruling out Behavior. 
   - No past initiated suicidal action is described, ruling out Attempt. 
   - The suicidal thought is personal and explicit, with no explicit negation of desire (e.g., ""I don't want to die""), so it fits Ideation. The conditional statement (""if I had a friend..."") does not make the thoughts explicitly unwanted; it only contextualizes their origin. 
   - Therefore, the best fit is Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post uses a metaphor of being in an out-of-control car to express feelings of helplessness, anxiety, and sadness. It mentions a desire for the pain to stop by ""crashing into another car,"" which symbolizes a suicidal act. The phrase ""I frequently come close to doing it but never can"" indicates recurrent suicidal urges that are not acted upon due to fear of surviving with more pain. There are no explicit mentions of death, suicide, or self-harm terms, but the metaphor implies suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""pointless situation""), despair, and anxiety. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are described beyond the metaphorical crashing. The temporal context is ongoing (""frequently""), with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or past initiated actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, it expresses a clear personal desire for life to end through the metaphor, e.g., ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing,"" which strongly implies a wish to die. The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the inaction is due to fear of consequences, not a lack of desire. Therefore, there is an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire, leaning toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The method ""crashing into another car"" is metaphorical and vague, not a concrete real-world plan (e.g., no specific tools, locations, or preparations mentioned). The phrase ""come close to doing it"" suggests urges but no actual intended action or preparation. Given the lack of specificity, imminence, or real-world planning, this does not indicate 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes recurrent urges (""frequently come close"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of actual crashing or attempts). ""Come close"" indicates ideation or near-behavior, not an attempt. No historical attempts are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows a personal desire to die (implied by the metaphor), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). There is no plan, method, preparation, or action beyond the metaphor, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past initiated lethal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The core is recurrent suicidal thoughts with a desire to end life but no actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post describes feelings of loneliness, abuse from job and parents, and a friend's neglect. It explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""Only a matter of when,"" indicating suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""so tired of this empty loneliness"") and despair. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, note-writing) are mentioned. No past suicidal actions are referenced. The phrase ""only a matter of when"" implies future intent but lacks imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). The desire to die is explicit and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide. It expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself"") with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The phrase ""only a matter of when"" suggests timing but does not imply a concrete plan or method, even when considering the explicit desire. Imminence is low due to the vague timeframe, so this does not elevate to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and future suicidal intent (""going to,"" ""only a matter of when""). No past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"") confirms suicidal ideation. However, the absence of any plan, method, preparation, or high imminence means this is not 'Behavior'. The lack of past actions rules out 'Attempt'. While distress and loneliness are present, the personal suicidal intent is clear and not ambiguous, so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. The vagueness of ""only a matter of when"" does not imply a plan; thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""death is an option"" and questions if this constitutes suicidal thought. The author explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no intention to act on suicidal urges. Death is discussed in a hypothetical, passive context (e.g., dying in an accident without suffering), and the author expresses that such an outcome ""is not the worst outcome."" There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators are limited to a philosophical or resigned tone, without expressions of hopelessness, despair, or burden. The focus is on the abstract idea of death as an option, with a clear negation of personal action (""I won't commit"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thought"" but only in a questioning context (e.g., ""Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought?""). It does not contain explicit personal declarations like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself."" Instead, the author negates any desire for self-initiated death with ""I won't commit."" The hypothetical accident scenario implies passive acceptance of death but not an active wish to die. Suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted or not acted upon, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to an accident is external and not self-initiated, so it does not imply a plan or intended action. With no desire to die expressed and no plan/method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current thoughts and hypotheticals, with no description of past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, overdoses, or initiated harm). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses general distress about the concept of death and questions if their thoughts are suicidal, but explicitly states no intent to act (""I won't commit""). This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes discussions of suicide where personal desire to die is negated or ambiguous, and thoughts are framed as unwanted. There is no clear expression of a desire to die (e.g., ""I hate living"" is absent), no plan/method, and no past action. Ambiguity in the phrase ""death is an option"" is resolved by the explicit negation of action, making 'Indicator' the best fit over 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes direct mentions of suicide (""kill me"") and expresses a strong desire to act imminently (""Tonight is the last chance""). Emotional indicators include a sense of urgency (""ran out of time,"" ""wont lose the oportunity"") and reluctance (""I wish i didnt have to do this""), but the overall sentiment leans toward determination (""im doing the right after all""). 
   - Specific plans and preparations are evident: ""planned this"" for a year, ""have the stuff prepared,"" and a clear timeframe (""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is explicit (""finally kill me""), and while there is reluctance, it does not negate the personal intent to act (e.g., it is not stated as unwanted thoughts; instead, it frames the action as necessary).
   - No past initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me,"" which is a direct suicidal phrase.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""finally kill me,"" ""tonight is the last chance,"" ""im doing the right"") in a context of despair. The reluctance (""I wish i didnt have to do this"") does not explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted or that there is no genuine desire to die; it implies compulsion rather than rejection of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a method or means is strongly implied through ""have the stuff prepared,"" indicating tangible preparations (e.g., tools, substances). The year-long planning (""a year since i planned this"") and imminent action (""tonight"") reinforce this. Given the explicit desire to die and high imminence, the vague reference to ""stuff"" still constitutes a plan in context.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""tonight,"" ""im doing the right"") and past planning, but no past initiated lethal actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). The phrase ""planned this"" refers to preparation, not an action that was carried out. Therefore, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post has explicit suicidal intent (from step 2), ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). 
   - It includes planning, preparation, and imminent action (from step 3), moving it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks these elements). 
   - There is no description of a past initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 
   - The combination of desire, plan, preparation, and imminence fits 'Behavior'. The reluctance does not change this, as it does not negate the intent or plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: Explicit mention of ""kill myself,"" which directly references suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I see no reason to fuel it with energy""), despair (""I hate my body,"" ""I hate my body""), and a desire for life to end (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). Specific method is mentioned: ""stop eating all together and stave myself"" (starvation as a means to cause death). Preparation is indicated by ""I've decided,"" showing intent to act. No past actions described; the focus is on current/future behavior. Imminence is implied by the decision (""decided"") and the hope for a slow breakdown. The writer expresses a genuine desire for death through starvation, despite stating reluctance toward direct suicide (""too much of a pussy to kill myself""), which does not negate the overall desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is explicitly mentioned. Yes, a clear desire to die is expressed through ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"" and ""I see no reason to fuel it with energy,"" indicating a wish for life to end. The reluctance (""too much of a pussy"") acknowledges fear but does not state the thoughts are unwanted or that there is no desire to die; instead, it redirects to an alternative method (starvation).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: starvation (""stop eating all together and stave myself"") with the intent to cause death. Preparation is indicated by ""I've decided,"" showing initiation of the plan. The method is concrete, and the decision implies imminence. With explicit desire present, this points to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current intention (""decided to stop eating"") and future action, not a past initiated event. There is no mention of a past suicide attempt or self-initiated lethal action; the starvation plan is prospective.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""this just ends""), moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire). The presence of a specific method (starvation) and preparation (""decided"") rules out 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method). No past initiated lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The combination of desire, method, and intended action fits 'Behavior'. The reluctance toward direct suicide does not negate the suicidal intent behind the starvation plan.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch. In my past I've had everything that made me who I am stripped away from my character time and time again. It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress (e.g., ""I'm not ok,"" ""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness"").  
   - Mentions a fleeting desire related to death (""I don't *always* wish to be gone""), but this is explicitly qualified as inconsistent.  
   - No explicit references to suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.  
   - Focuses on enduring suffering, existential confusion, and loneliness, ending with a hopeful outreach (""I just hope I'm not alone"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or direct phrases like ""I want to die.""  
   - The phrase ""I don't always wish to be gone"" implies occasional passive ideation but **explicitly negates persistent desire** and lacks genuine suicidal intent. Strong expressions like ""I hate living"" are absent.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned**; instead, distress is centered on loneliness and confusion.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No** references to plans, methods, tools, locations, preparations, or intended actions.  
   - Vague references to suffering (""dragged my face through the muds of life"") describe past endurance, not suicidal behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **past suffering** (e.g., ""stripped away,"" ""dragged my face through the muds"") but **no mention of past suicidal actions or attempts**.  
   - Focuses on current emotional pain, not imminent intent or historical suicide-related actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: The core of the post is **distress and emotional pain** (loneliness, confusion, brokenness) with **no clear personal desire to die**. The phrase ""I don’t always wish to be gone"" suggests **explicitly unwanted or inconsistent thoughts**, leaning strongly toward Indicator.  
   - **Not Ideation**: While ""wish to be gone"" hints at passive ideation, it is negated (""don’t always"") and lacks explicit suicidal desire or intent.  
   - **No evidence** for Behavior (no plan/action) or Attempt (no described past actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal"" explicitly.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""permanently fucked up,"" ""destroyed myself,"" ""nothing to look forward to"").  
   - References guilt about future impact on sibling (""hurting to delay the pain my death will cause"").

   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines** for suicide.  
   - **No descriptions of past self-initiated actions** (e.g., attempts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly states ""suicidal"" (direct personal expression).  
   - Desires like ""wish I wasn't so broken"" and ""want a restart"" imply a wish to escape life but **lack unambiguous desire to die** (e.g., no ""I want to die"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **current emotional state**, not past actions.  
   - **No reference to any initiated suicidal act** (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit ""suicidal"" + hopelessness confirms **personal desire to escape life**, leaning toward *Ideation*.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No past/current self-initiated lethal action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - While distress is evident, the **direct acknowledgment of ""suicidal"" without negation** elevates it beyond *Indicator*.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""end myself,"" ""take my own life.""
   - Strong emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""Nothing is happening,"" ""stagnant,"" ""life was set up for failure""), despair (""body is destroyed,"" ""pathetic""), and burden (""paycheck sapped,"" ""responsibility of their would-be husbands"").
   - Desire to die expressed: ""it is probably best I head out before it gets worse,"" ""the fuck am I getting up in the morning for?""  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, dates, or actions like acquiring means). Uncertainty about action is explicit: ""I don't know if or when I will take my own life.""  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are presented as escalating but not unwanted or resisted; the tone aligns with genuine despair.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""end myself,"" and ""take my own life"" are used.  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""head out before it gets worse"") and hopelessness (""life isn't worth it"" implied by questioning purpose).  
   - **No**: Thoughts are not framed as unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or imminent timelines. Intent is vague (""I don’t know if or when"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No**: Describes current/future ideation only. No past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""end myself,"" ""head out"") and suicidal thoughts are present, but no plan, method, preparation, or action is indicated. Uncertainty (""I don’t know if or when"") and absence of specifics confirm lack of behavioral elements.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is personal and not negated/unwanted.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mention of self-harm: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""Took my dremel and put the saw attachment on and followed the lines.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling distant, self-loathing (""I am not a good person""), hopelessness (""my death will only benefit people"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Detailed description of researching the radial artery, marking the location, and using a dremel with a saw attachment.  
   - Imminence: Action is stated as completed (""I just slit my wrists""), with the post intended to be shared posthumously (""if you are seeing this then it’s already too late"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""it took me years to decide this but now I just want to get it over with"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. ""Slit my wrists"" is a direct method of suicide, coupled with ""my death will only benefit people"" and ""Goodbye,"" confirming a genuine desire to die. No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes. Specific method (cutting radial artery with a dremel saw), preparation (researching anatomy, marking arteries), and tools (dremel) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated action**: ""I just slit my wrists"" (past tense), ""followed the lines,"" and ""Took my dremel."" This is a potentially lethal action initiated by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post details a **past/very recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (cutting wrists with a tool after preparation). This meets the definition of 'Attempt,' as the author describes an action they have already taken. The historical context (""took me years to decide"") doesn’t override the current/recent action. 'Attempt' takes precedence over 'Behavior' when an action is initiated, even if the outcome is uncertain.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses the author's own suicidal feelings: ""I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that,"" ""I don't want to keep going myself."" These express a personal desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""life isn't worth it"" implied by not believing their own encouragement) and internal conflict about honesty.
   - **No mention** of specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past self-initiated actions by the author. The focus is on concealed thoughts and moral conflict.
   - The suicidal thoughts are **not framed as unwanted** (e.g., no statements like ""I don’t want these thoughts""). Instead, the author actively hides them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" confirming a personal desire to die. No negation of this desire exists.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No reference to methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or imminent timelines (""tonight,"" ""soon""). The author only discloses concealed thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **No**: Describes **current** suicidal thoughts but **no past or recent self-initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted...""). Mentions are solely about ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""suicidal myself,"" ""don't want to keep going"") without disclaiming the thoughts → **Not Indicator**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation or stated intention to act imminently → **Not Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/initiated self-harm actions → **Not Attempt**.  
   - The core content is **active suicidal thoughts/desire lacking actionable plans** → **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" directly referencing suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include blame (""everyone else's fault""), perceived mistreatment (""treating me different""), and externalization of responsibility (""not my fault"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - The phrasing is conditional (""If I become worse..."") and lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - The desire to die is explicit but framed as a hypothetical outcome of worsening conditions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**, the statement implies a genuine (though conditional) desire to die. There is no negation of the desire (e.g., no language like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, or preparatory actions).  
   - The conditional phrasing (""if I become worse"") and vague reference to ""do something bad or kill myself"" lack concrete action or method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario (""if I become worse"").  
   - **No** past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""kill myself"") is present → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/initiated self-harm actions** → Rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions past suicidal desire (""i wanted to die when i made that post""), but explicitly states a current lack of desire to die (""i just don't want to die""). It expresses hopelessness (""state my hopelessness,"" ""i have no hope""), despair (""desperate,"" ""meaningless torture""), and emotional distress (""feel like breaking""). There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The focus is on the difficulty of seeking help and the emotional toll of vulnerability.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions a past desire to die (""i wanted to die""), but this is qualified by a clear, current negation of that desire (""i just don't want to die""). The suicidal thought is presented as unwanted in the present context, as the author expresses distress about their hopelessness without indicating a genuine current wish to die. Phrases like ""i have no hope"" convey despair but, when combined with the explicit negation, do not constitute a current suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The references to actions (e.g., writing a draft, deleting it) relate to help-seeking, not suicidal behavior. There is no indication of imminent action or vague implied plans, even in the context of past desire.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The suicidal desire is explicitly in the past (""when i made that post"") and not described as a current intention. There is no mention of any past or recent self-initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt); the only actions discussed are non-suicidal (writing/deleting a draft). The post focuses on current emotional distress without linking to any concrete suicidal behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of past suicidal thoughts is explicitly stated as unwanted in the present (""i just don't want to die""), which aligns with the 'Indicator' category. The core of the post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and despair, but without a current personal desire to die or any plan/action. Strong expressions like ""i have no hope"" are tempered by the negation of suicidal intent, so this is not 'Ideation'. No plan/method ('Behavior') or past action ('Attempt') is present. Therefore, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes explicit phrases: ""trying to kill myself"" and ""ready to say goodbye.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit,"" ""failure,"" ""letting everyone down,"" ""broken and lifeless.""  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline mentioned (e.g., pills, locations, notes).  
   - Ambivalence is noted (""ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not""), but the core statement expresses active intent.  
   - Focuses on the author's current state (""am trying,"" ""at this point"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent.  
   - The phrase ""ready to say goodbye"" reinforces this desire. The ambivalence (""I'm also not"") does not negate the explicit intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Mentions ""trying to kill myself"" but lacks details (e.g., tools, substances, locations, or preparatory steps).  
   - The phrase implies ongoing effort but is too vague to confirm a concrete plan or imminent action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current intent** (""am trying"") but no mention of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., ""I took pills"").  
   - Focus is on present feelings and ideation, not a historical attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ruled out 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die is present.  
   - **Ruled out 'Attempt'**: No description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **Behavior vs. Ideation**:  
     - Strong intent (""trying to kill myself"") suggests action, but the absence of any plan/method/preparation leans toward **Ideation**.  
     - ""Ready to say goodbye"" hints at preparation but is metaphorical and unspecific. Without concrete details, this remains ambiguous.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself"" and indirect references to death (""fear of death,"" ""scared to die,"" ""emptiness after death,"" ""hope that I don't wake up"").
   - Emotional indicators are strong: expressions of hopelessness (""I'm done""), despair (""neverending cycle""), fear, and internal conflict (""hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time"").
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to parents having ""taken any means they can think of"" implies means have been removed, but the author does not describe any personal plan, method, tools, location, or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note). The phrase ""I could do it right now"" suggests capability and high imminence but lacks specificity about how the act would be carried out.
   - There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""the only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death,"" ""hope that I don't wake up""), but this desire is conflicted due to fear. The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, the fear acts as a barrier to action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die or for life to end, as seen in ""the only thing preventing me from killing myself"" and ""hope that I don't wake up."" This is not abstract or unwanted; the desire is present but inhibited by fear.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not negated as unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""); the fear prevents action but does not diminish the underlying desire. Thus, this strongly leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or strongly implied. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" is vague and does not indicate a method, even with high imminence.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are described. The mention of parents removing means is external and does not reflect the author's own preparations or plans.
   - Despite high imminence and explicit desire, the lack of any reference to a plan, method, or intended action means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current and future intentions (""I could do it right now"") but no past or recent self-initiated actions. There is no mention of a specific past attempt (e.g., ""I tried to..."") that was initiated by the author. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post clearly expresses a personal desire to die with explicit suicidal thoughts, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. The presence of high imminence (""I could do it right now"") does not elevate it to 'Behavior' because no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned—intent alone is insufficient. The fear of death creates conflict but does not negate the desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'. With no past actions described, 'Attempt' is not applicable. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of death and suicide (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" ""fear of death,"" ""what happens after I die""). Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present (""I have nothing to live for,"" ""no point in me being alive,"" ""I hate living with my family,"" ""friendships are kinda failing""). There is no mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or timeframes indicating imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). The writer expresses a desire to die but is conflicted due to fear of death and the unknown afterlife, with no reference to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""no point in me being alive,"" ""I hate living""). The fear of death is described as a barrier, but it does not negate the personal desire to die or explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don't actually want to die""). Thus, this points away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The writer discusses abstract fears (""what happens after I die"") and general distress, but there is no indication of intended action, tools, locations, or steps toward suicide. The high desire to die is present, but without any plan or imminent action, this aligns with 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, such as ""I tried to"" or ""I took pills""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"") and hopelessness (e.g., ""I hate living""), which meets the criteria for 'Ideation'. The absence of any plan, method, preparation, or imminent action rules out 'Behavior'. The fear of death is a mitigating factor but does not make the thoughts explicitly unwanted (as required for 'Indicator'), and there are no past actions for 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

All I've done for the past few months is cause anguish and pain to those around me. I'm better off dead. Only 1 person left that cares. Can't stand this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses profound emotional distress, including feelings of being ""broken,"" identity confusion (""Not a man or woman...""), hopelessness (""My being in itself is a prison""), and a sense of being a burden (""cause anguish and pain to those around me""). It explicitly states a desire for death with ""I'm better off dead"" and includes phrases indicating extreme despair (""Can't stand this anymore""). There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight""). No past suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, it expresses a clear personal desire for life to end with ""I'm better off dead,"" which is similar to phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""life isn't worth it"" in the context of despair. This implies a genuine wish to die, not just abstract distress. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I don't want to die""), so it leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. Phrases like ""Can't stand this anymore"" convey urgency but lack any reference to intended action, means, or how death might occur. Without a plan or method, even with high distress, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and recent experiences (e.g., ""past few months""), with no description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""I'm better off dead"" indicates a personal desire for death, aligning with 'Ideation' (defined as explicit personal expressions of wanting life to end). While the post includes distress and hopelessness, the lack of explicit negation (e.g., ""I don't want to die"") rules out 'Indicator'. No plan or method is present, so 'Behavior' is not applicable. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' is excluded. The key phrase ""better off dead"" is sufficiently direct to categorize as 'Ideation' without ambiguity.

As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal planning: ""set a date,"" ""letters were written,"" ""had a set plan,"" ""days away from going through with.""  
   - Explicitly references coming ""extraordinarily close to killing myself.""  
   - Current stance: ""made the decision to live,"" ""situation is no longer desperate,"" ""light at the end of the tunnel.""  
   - No current desire to die; focuses on recovery.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and detailed plans, but **only in past context**.  
   - **Current desire negated**: ""decision to live,"" ""keep living,"" ""situation improving.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Past plan/preparation confirmed: ""letters written,"" ""set plan,"" ""days away from going through with.""  
   - **No current plan/method/preparation**; focus is on recovery.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past preparations** (letters, plan, setting dates) but **no initiated action**.  
   - ""Came extraordinarily close"" implies imminent risk but **no actual self-harm attempt occurred** (e.g., no pills taken, no injury).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicidal **preparations (letters, plan, timeline)** with high imminence (""days away"") but **no initiated lethal action** → **Behavior**.  
   - ""Attempt"" requires initiated action (e.g., ingesting pills, jumping), which is absent.  
   - Current content lacks desire/plan → not Ideation or current Behavior.  
   - **Key distinction**: Preparations with intent but no action = **Behavior**.

And I'm angry that it would be considered selfish by so many",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses anger and regret for not acting on suicidal thoughts in the past (""I'm angry at myself for not doing it years ago""). It mentions a history of wishing not to be alive and wanting things to end since 2012, with some gaps of happiness. There is a hypothetical regret about not acting on initial suicidal thoughts to avoid current suffering. Emotional indicators include anger, hopelessness, and feeling that suicide would be perceived as selfish.
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Implicit references like ""not doing it"" (where ""it"" contextually implies suicide), ""wished I wasn't alive,"" and ""wanted things to be over."" No explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. The post is retrospective, focusing on past inaction rather than current plans, methods, or preparations.
   - References to past actions: Describes past suicidal thoughts and regret for not acting, but no initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The phrase ""not doing it"" confirms no action was taken.
   - Imminence: No current or future intentions indicated; all references are to past feelings and regrets.
   - Stated desire: The desire to die is expressed in the past tense and hypothetically (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wish that I had just done it""), with no explicit current desire stated. The regret suggests the past desire was genuine but not acted upon, and there is no indication that current thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide/death? No, phrases like ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""not doing it"" and ""wished I wasn't alive"" strongly imply suicidal intent in context.
   - Clear desire to die? Yes, historically and hypothetically (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over""). These are expressions of a personal desire to not be alive, similar to ""I hate living,"" and are not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""). This leans toward 'Ideation'.
   - Unwanted thoughts? No, the regret for not acting indicates the thoughts were not resisted or unwanted at the time; instead, there is frustration about inaction.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method/plan? No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations.
   - Intended action? No current or future action implied; the post is about past inaction and regret.
   - Vague references with high imminence? None, as imminence is absent. Thus, no elements point to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Timeframe: Focuses on past feelings (since 2012) and hypothetical regret, with no description of any initiated suicidal action. The phrase ""not doing it"" explicitly states no action occurred.
   - Past action? No, there is no description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive"") without any plan, method, or preparation, placing it in 'Ideation'. The historical context and regret do not change the current classification, as there is no indication of unwanted thoughts (which would make it 'Indicator') or any action (which would lead to 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'). Strong expressions like ""wished I wasn't alive"" are considered 'Ideation' when not negated, and the absence of a plan confirms this.

I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal,"" ""written a note,"" ""killing myself,"" ""ready to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Depression, hopelessness (""I'm depressed and suicidal"").  
   - Preparations: Written suicide note detailing possessions.  
   - Desire to die: ""still wanting to die,"" ""ready to die.""  
   - Imminence: No specific timeframe, but recurring thoughts/readiness.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" ""wanting to die.""  
   - Desire is persistent and **not negated** (administrative tasks delay action but don’t negate intent).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - Yes: Specific preparation (""written a note that includes what I want each person to receive"").  
   - Administrative thoughts imply planning logistics, reinforcing preparatory intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes **preparations (note)** and **intent to act**, but **no past/initiated lethal action**.  
   - ""Getting ready to die"" implies impending action but no actual attempt described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die + preparation (suicide note) = **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Preparations (note) and intent distinguish this from 'Ideation' (thoughts alone).

One of my friebds thought i was stalking the friendd. I got in trouble woth my family and ive never been more suicidal in my life.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post describes a recent incident where the author trespassed on a friend's property, leading to potential legal trouble, accusations of stalking, and family conflict. The phrase ""ive never been more suicidal in my life"" explicitly mentions suicidal feelings. There are emotional indicators of distress and despair related to the consequences of their actions, but no mention of death, dying, self-harm, or specific suicide methods/means. No plan, preparation, or intended action for suicide is described. The temporal context is current (""in my life""), referring to their present state, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The author expresses a genuine personal desire to die through the word ""suicidal,"" without any negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" which directly indicates personal suicidal thoughts or a desire to die. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not representing a current personal desire (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""). Therefore, this is not merely distress about unwanted thoughts but an expression of genuine suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. The reference to feeling suicidal is general and lacks any indication of a plan, intended action, or imminence. The phrase ""in my life"" suggests a current state but not immediate action. Without any plan/method element, this cannot be classified as Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past non-suicidal action (trespassing ""yesterday"") and current suicidal feelings, but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt, such as ""I tried to harm myself""). The suicidal expression is about present thoughts, not a historical or recent attempt. Therefore, Attempt does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal"" with no negation indicates a personal desire to die, falling under Ideation. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out Behavior. The absence of any described past suicidal action rules out Attempt. The expression is not abstract or about unwanted thoughts alone (which would be Indicator), as ""suicidal"" conveys current personal ideation. Phrases like ""ive never been more suicidal"" are direct expressions of suicidal thoughts without ambiguity, aligning with Ideation. No elements suggest higher categories (Behavior or Attempt), so Ideation is the best fit.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being trapped (e.g., ""Australia = Auschwitz,"" ""prison colony,"" ""slaves to a fascist regime,"" ""no freedom""). It uses metaphorical language to describe societal oppression, comparing it to historical atrocities like Auschwitz and Hitler's regime.
   - There are **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means**. The references to Auschwitz and Hitler are historical/ideological, not personal or actionable.
   - **Emotional indicators** include hopelessness (e.g., ""illusion of freedom,"" ""slaves"") and a sense of being a burden or controlled, but these are directed at societal conditions, not personal self-worth or suicidal desire.
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or intended actions** related to suicide are present. The content is abstract and political, focusing on collective suffering.
   - **No references to past suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, self-harm) or timeframes related to personal behavior.
   - **No imminence** of suicidal intent is indicated; the post discusses ongoing societal issues, not immediate personal threats.
   - The **stated desire** is for societal change or recognition of oppression, not a personal wish to die or end life. Phrases like ""we are all slaves"" express collective distress, not individual suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **No explicit mentions** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - **No clear personal desire to die or for life to end** is expressed. While there is despair (e.g., ""no freedom""), it is not framed as a wish for personal death (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The distress is externalized to society.
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, so the question of them being unwanted does not apply.
   - This strongly leans toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation** is mentioned in relation to suicide or self-harm. The Auschwitz reference is metaphorical, not indicative of a personal plan.
   - Without any suicidal desire (from Step 2), this step is not applicable, but even if distress were present, there is no actionable element.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a **current societal/political state** with no reference to past, present, or future personal actions related to suicide.
   - **No description of past initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no mentions of ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses **general distress, hopelessness, and despair** about societal conditions, but it **lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**. This aligns with 'Indicator'.
   - Key phrases like ""we are all slaves"" or ""no freedom"" indicate profound unhappiness but are not equivalent to personal suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be 'Ideation'). Here, the sentiment is collective and abstract.
   - There is **no ambiguity** suggesting suicidal ideation; the content is purely sociopolitical ranting without self-referential suicidal intent.
   - 'Ideation' is not applicable due to the absence of personal desire to die. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are ruled out by the lack of plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.
   - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the best fit, as the post reflects distress without personal suicidal elements.

Its seems so terrifying. I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of being unloved (""My family doesn't love me""), unwanted (""friends just put up with me""), isolated (""I feel so alone in the world""), and hopeless about the future (""college... seems so terrifying""). It directly states a desire to die: ""I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else."" There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., previous attempts). The timeframe for suicidal intent is vague, with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") indicated; the focus is on general despair. The desire to die is presented as genuine and not unwanted—there is no negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it contains a clear, personal expression of desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to die""). Phrases like ""Heaven seems really good right now"" and ""be with Jesus"" contextualize this as a desired escape, indicating suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates personal desire (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit desire to die is present (Yes).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The desire to die is not coupled with any plan or intended action (e.g., no references to ""how"" or ""when"" beyond the abstract wish). Imminence is low, as the only future reference is about college, not about acting on suicidal thoughts. Therefore, no elements of plan or preparation are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional pain and future fears (e.g., going to college), but it does not reference any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). All content is prospective or expressive of desire, with no history of behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I just want to die"") confirms suicidal ideation, placing this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguous desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, preparation, or imminence rules out 'Behavior'. No past or recent initiated actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The phrase ""I just want to die"" is a strong indicator of 'Ideation', as it expresses personal suicidal thoughts without actionable elements. There is no ambiguity in desire, and the emotional context supports this classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""considering suicide"" explicitly.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""hopelessness feeling,"" ""stuck inside of a nightmare,"" overwhelming distress (""can't fucking take it anymore""), feelings of abandonment.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., no tools, locations, or dates like ""tonight"").  
   - No references to past suicide actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence: ""right now"" indicates current distress but no immediate action plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""considering suicide"" and ""can't fucking take it anymore.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses genuine desire to escape pain via suicide. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Only mentions ""considering suicide"" without describing a method, plan, tools, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional state and suicidal thoughts.  
   - **No**: No past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""considering suicide"") without unwanted-thought qualifiers → **Ideation** (not Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation → **Ideation** (not Behavior).

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author states: ""I'm suicidal myself."" This is a direct personal expression of suicidal thoughts.  
   - No explicit mentions of death/dying methods, plans, preparations, or past actions by the *author*. The author’s suicidal feelings are described as a current state without elaboration on intent, method, or action.  
   - Emotional indicators: The author expresses helplessness, fear, and distress about their friend’s situation but frames their own suicidal state passively (e.g., ""I'm suicidal myself"" lacks desire, plan, or action).  
   - Key focus: The post primarily details the *friend's* suicide attempts/behavior, but the author’s personal risk is confined to the phrase ""I'm suicidal myself.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the author explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself."" This confirms a personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts.  
   - No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"") is present. Phrases like ""I'm suicidal"" imply ideation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a plan, method, tools, preparations, or imminent intent by the author. The statement is vague and lacks actionable context.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No** description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions by the author. The author only references their *current* suicidal feelings.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author’s statement (""I'm suicidal myself"") expresses a personal desire to die, fitting **Ideation**.  
   - No evidence of a plan/method (Behavior) or past action (Attempt). The absence of negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"") rules out Indicator.  
   - The friend’s suicide attempts are irrelevant per rules (risk classification applies only to the post’s author).

312,"Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains direct pleas for death: ""Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain."" This includes explicit mentions of dying or ending life, with strong emotional indicators of despair and intense suffering.
   - There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), plans, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight""). The plea is directed at an unspecified ""you,"" but it lacks any description of self-initiated action or means.
   - No past suicidal actions are described; the focus is on current emotional pain and a desire for relief through death.
   - The writer's desire is unambiguously for life to end, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which directly express a personal desire to die. There is no ambiguity or negation of this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The plea is general and lacks any actionable details, even if vague. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""now"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current, future-oriented desire (""Just kill me"") but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no references to attempts). It is solely expressive of intent, not action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""end my life"") aligns with 'Ideation', as there is no plan, method, or preparation described. The lack of these elements rules out 'Behavior'. The absence of any past initiated action rules out 'Attempt'. The clear personal suicidal intent (not abstract or unwanted) rules out 'Indicator'. Phrases like ""end my life"" are strong indicators of ideation when not coupled with actionable elements.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" and explicitly discusses suicide as a utilitarian solution.  
   - Emotional indicators: Self-directed anger, guilt over hurting others, hopelessness about future relationships, and conflict between logic (""pain isn't worth my existence"") and a faint opposing voice (""cry for help"").  
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines** (e.g., no tools, locations, dates, or actions like acquiring means).  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions.  
   - Desire to die is explicitly stated as a rationalized conclusion (""utilitarian""), though conflicted by a small internal voice.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die based on utilitarian logic (""pain isn't worth my existence""). The conflicted voice (""cry for help"") does **not** explicitly negate the desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No mention** of methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  
   - No implied action or imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). Logic is abstract, not actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intention** (""I want to check I’m making the right decision"").  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described (only references anger issues and emotional harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal intent place this beyond *Indicator* (unwanted thoughts are not clearly stated; the ""cry for help"" is secondary to the primary rationalized desire).  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past self-initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Ideation** fits: Strong expressions of suicidal desire (""end my life,"" ""killing myself"") without plans/methods.

314,"I don't want it anymore. I'm so tired, no matter how much i try and better myself or challenge myself my thoughts always just come back to this. I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I won't ever be happy""), despair (""I'm so tired""), and anhedonia (""Everything is a chore""). It explicitly references suicide through phrases like ""end it all"" and ""don't want to be here."" A specific method is mentioned (""gun"") as a solution, though access is noted as impossible in the UK. No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the focus is on current feelings and thoughts. Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), but the desire to die is clear. The writer's stated desire is to not be alive, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide: No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.
   - Clear desire to die: Yes, through ""I don't want it anymore"" (likely referring to life), ""don't want to be here,"" and the rhetorical question about ending life. These express a personal, current wish for life to end.
   - Unwanted thoughts negated: No, the thoughts are presented as genuine and persistent (""my thoughts always just come back to this""), with no statement that they are unwanted or resisted.
   - Conclusion: Explicit suicidal intent is present, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method mentioned: Yes, ""a gun"" is explicitly referenced as a means to ""solve everything,"" indicating it is considered a viable method for suicide, despite access issues.
   - Signs of preparation: No mention of active preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Context with desire and imminence: The method is tied to the expressed desire to die, but imminence is low (no immediate timeframe). However, the specificity of the method, even in a hypothetical context, implies planning.
   - Conclusion: The mention of a specific method (gun) in relation to suicidal intent supports 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past events: No description of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").
   - Current/future intention: The post focuses on current ideation and frustration over lack of options, but no concrete plans or actions are described as imminent or initiated.
   - Conclusion: No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""don't want to be here""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - The presence of a specific method (gun) mentioned in the context of solving the writer's distress indicates a plan or intended action, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' (which lacks any plan/method). Even though access is denied, the identification of a method leans toward 'Behavior'.
   - No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Final reasoning: This is 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal desire and the specific method reference, despite the absence of imminence or preparation.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>

   - **Protective factors**: Love for dogs (""I would worry about them""), attachment to parents (""I love them""), future plans (graduation/job), and medication use.  
   - **Temporal context**: All suicidal expressions are hypothetical/emotional reactions (""when they yell... I wish""), not linked to plans or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I wish I could die"" and ""curl up and die"" are direct expressions of a desire to die.

That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction.

I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself.

Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Mentions severe self-disgust, disappointment in self, and a coping mechanism (masturbation) tied to distress. Explicitly states ""wanting to kill myself"" and masturbating to that thought.  
   - Emotional indicators: Self-hatred, disgust, hopelessness (""how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself,"" ""terrible feeling"").  
   - Explicit suicide intent: Directly states ""wanting to kill myself.""  
   - Plan/method/preparation: No mention of a method, tools, location, timeline, or preparations. Only describes thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""wanting to kill myself"" is an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire. The thought is not framed as unwanted/distressing (e.g., ""my brain says X but I don’t want to""); instead, it’s actively used in a coping mechanism.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past or recent suicide attempt described. The phrase ""ended up masturbating to the thought"" describes a mental/emotional response, not a physical self-harm action.

   - Explicit desire to die (""wanting to kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of an initiated self-harm action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Suicidal desire is personal and explicit (not abstract/unwanted), ruling out **Indicator**.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses suicide philosophically, defending it as a personal choice and means of escape. Key elements include explicit statements like ""suicide is seen as a solution,"" ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life,"" and ""wanting to end my life."" There are strong expressions of hopelessness (e.g., ""I never wished to be born,"" ""No one is really listening to any of us"") and a clear personal desire for death as relief. However, there is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or a timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight""). The author ends by stating they are going to bed after work, indicating no imminent action. No past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""end my life"" multiple times. It expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life,"" ""suicide is seen as a solution""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on them""). Instead, the desire is presented as rational and desired.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. References to ""end my life"" and ""kill themselves"" are vague and lack concrete details on how or when. The context shows high intent but low imminence (e.g., the author is going to bed, no urgency indicated). Without any plan, method, or preparatory steps, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current beliefs and feelings about suicide, with no description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mentions of ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). It is entirely forward-looking in terms of desire, but not action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (e.g., ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"") and personal suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about the desire being unwanted. The lack of any plan, method, preparation, or imminent action rules out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The content aligns with 'Ideation'—expressing a strong personal wish to die without concrete plans or methods.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-harm (""cutting"") and an incident ""a few months ago"" where the author cut their arm to ""relieve some of the pain.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling ""numb and empty,"" crying due to invalidation, hopelessness (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"").  
   - **No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or suicidal methods.** Self-harm (cutting) is discussed as a past coping mechanism, not linked to suicidal intent.  
   - Describes invalidation from others (accusations of ""faking"" cutting, being an ""attention seeker"").  
   - The phrase ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" expresses hopelessness but **not a direct desire to die or end life**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mentions** of suicide, killing oneself, or a genuine wish to die.  
   - The closest phrase (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"") reflects despair but **lacks a personal expression of wanting death** (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - **No suicidal thoughts are mentioned at all**, unwanted or otherwise.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or intended action** related to suicide is described.  
   - Self-harm (cutting) is explicitly framed as a way to ""relieve pain,"" not as a suicide attempt or step.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - References **past self-harm** (non-suicidal) and invalidation.  
   - **No description of past or current suicidal actions** (e.g., no mention of suicide attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **distress, hopelessness, and invalidation trauma** but lacks:  
     - Explicit personal suicidal desire (required for Ideation).  
     - Any plan/method for suicide (required for Behavior).  
     - Any description of a past self-initiated suicidal action (required for Attempt).  
   - Self-harm is discussed in a non-suicidal context (pain relief), aligning with **general distress**.  
   - The phrase ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" is vague and **insufficient for Ideation** without explicit suicidal intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: Falls under **Indicator** (expresses distress without personal suicidal desire/ideation).

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS: Key elements in the post**
   - Mentions of suicide: The post explicitly references ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts,"" indicating the presence of suicidal thoughts. However, it does not describe specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses despair, hopelessness, and distress due to a depressive episode, bipolar disorder, loss of coping mechanisms, lack of support from family, and barriers to seeking help (insurance, job concerns). Phrases like ""one hell of a depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse,"" and concerns about everything ""falling apart"" highlight emotional turmoil.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of a suicide plan, method, tools, locations, or preparatory actions. The focus is on considering hospitalization to prevent acting on thoughts, not on carrying out suicide.
   - References to past actions: No description of past suicide attempts or self-initiated lethal actions. The user mentions coping with bipolar symptoms for 7 years and reaching out for support, but these are not suicidal behaviors.
   - Imminence: The user states, ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point but that can change,"" suggesting no immediate intent. The consideration of waiting until February 1st for insurance implies a future-oriented focus on help-seeking, not imminent suicide risk.
   - Stated desire: The user explicitly says, ""I'd rather go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts,"" indicating a preference for help over acting on suicidal thoughts. This shows the thoughts are unwanted, and there is no expressed personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" which are direct references to suicide.
   - However, the user does not express a clear, current personal desire to die. Instead, they state they would rather seek help (""go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"") and emphasize not wanting negative outcomes (e.g., ""I don't wanna go broke""). The suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed as unwanted and something to be managed, not desired.
   - Since the writer explicitly states they do not want to act on the thoughts, this strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or plan (e.g., time, location) is mentioned or implied. The only ""action"" discussed is considering hospitalization, which is a help-seeking behavior, not a suicidal one.
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The barriers mentioned (insurance, job) relate to accessing care, not suicide planning.
   - Despite the presence of suicidal ideation, there is no indication of a plan, method, or intended action for suicide, even with imminence considered (e.g., ""that can change"" is vague and not coupled with any method). This points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**
   - The post describes current suicidal ideation and distress but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions. References to coping with bipolar disorder and seeking support are not suicidal actions.
   - No past suicide attempts are described (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). The focus is on current thoughts and future help-seeking intentions.
   - Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**
   - The post includes mentions of suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted and not desired to be acted upon (""I'd rather go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition, which includes expressions of distress with suicidal thoughts that are explicitly unwanted and lack a personal desire to die.
   - There is no clear expression of desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent), and phrases like ""I hate living"" are not present. The primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts and situation, not ideation with intent.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is identified, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past initiated action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Ambiguity between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' is resolved in favor of 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are explicitly negated and unwanted, and there is no genuine expression of personal desire to die after careful analysis.

320,"I hope I die soon. I have started to do heroin pretty much daily. Within 4 weeks I will be forced to go to some institution for drug addicts and mentally ill people and be forced anti psychotics there. Fuck that I once took a anti psychotic and it just kills me inside and some 'other person' takes over. My family was happy, that was the worst realization that my family and friends would rather 'kill me' and let the medication take over my body and just say 'oh look they fixed you!' Fuck them! They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead.""  
   - Method implied: Daily heroin use (substance with lethal potential).  
   - Preparations: Ongoing heroin use framed as a path to death (""Soon I will be finally dead"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Fuck that""), betrayal (""Fuck them!""), anger (""They will pay"").  
   - Imminence: ""Soon"" (repeated twice).  
   - No negation of suicidal desire; death is actively wished for.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" express a clear, personal desire for death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Heroin use is a specific, high-risk method (substance abuse with intent to die). The phrase ""started to do heroin pretty much daily"" coupled with ""Soon I will be finally dead"" implies intentional use as a means to achieve death.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future** action (ongoing heroin use leading to anticipated death). No description of a past initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I overdosed yesterday"" would be Attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Method (heroin) and preparation (daily use) are present.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No past/initiated lethal action described.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + method (heroin) + imminence (""soon"") + preparation (daily use as a pathway to death).

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a specific suicide method (""gun"" and ""hitting the brain stem"") and seeks technical details on how to carry it out effectively. It expresses emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair through statements such as ""I don't care about stuff like family will miss you"" and ""I genuinely do not care for any of those things,"" indicating a lack of concern for consequences or reasons to live. There are no references to past actions, but the inquiry about method implies current planning or preparation. The imminence is suggested by the practical, focused nature of the question. The writer's desire is clearly for death, as they dismiss common deterrents without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""hitting the brain stem"" with a gun is an unambiguous reference to a lethal suicidal method. It expresses a clear desire to die through the dismissal of reasons to live (e.g., ""I genuinely do not care""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the tone is accepting and action-oriented. Thus, explicit suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (gun to brain stem) is mentioned and elaborated on, with the writer seeking optimization (""best position"") for lethality. This indicates planning and preparation, as the question implies intent to act. Given the explicit desire to die and the high imminence suggested by the detailed inquiry, this points strongly to behavioral elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes no past actions (e.g., no references to previous attempts). It focuses on current/future intentions, as seen in the question about method. Therefore, there is no description of an initiated suicidal action that would qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., dismissing reasons to live), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of suicidal intent). The mention of a specific method and preparation (seeking advice on execution) elevates it from 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method) to 'Behavior'. There is no past action described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The high imminence and intent reinforce 'Behavior', as the writer is actively engaging with the method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions persistent suicidal thoughts: ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" and ""it wont leave my head.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair: ""everything just keeps getting worse.""
   - Self-harm is referenced (""my mum saw my self harm scars""), but self-harm is not equivalent to a suicide attempt; it is mentioned as scars, indicating past actions without suicidal intent specified.
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or imminence for suicide is indicated (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, notes, or timeframes like ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses distress about the persistent thoughts but does not explicitly state that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on them"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" indicating direct personal suicidal ideation.
   - The persistent thoughts imply a preoccupation with death, but there is no explicit negation of desire (e.g., no statement rejecting the thoughts or disavowing a wish to die). Phrases like ""it wont leave my head"" show distress but not an explicit lack of desire, leaning toward genuine ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.
   - No intended action or plan is described, even vaguely. The reference to self-harm scars does not constitute a plan or method for suicide.
   - With no imminence or contextual clues suggesting imminent action, this lacks elements of 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as ongoing and current (""hasn't been a single day"").
   - Self-harm scars indicate past self-harm, but self-harm is not inherently suicidal; it is presented here as non-lethal behavior (scars imply superficial or non-fatal actions) and not described as a suicide attempt. There is no mention of any past initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit and personal expression of persistent suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") without negation of desire qualifies as 'Ideation'.
   - Lack of plan, method, preparation, or imminence rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No described past or recent suicidal action (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language) rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Distress about thoughts alone does not make it 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is not explicitly unwanted or negated; instead, the content strongly implies personal ideation.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself"" and expressions of despair like ""I still feel like trash"" and ""I'm sick of life.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no way out"") and anhedonia (""no amount of sleep helps"").
   - There is a stated intention to act: ""Let's just do it"" implies immediacy and a call to carry out the suicidal thought.
   - No specific method, plan details, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current/future intent.
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or for life to end through phrases like ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""I'm sick of life."" There is no ambiguity or negation of this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. However, the phrase ""Let's just do it"" indicates an intended action with high imminence, especially when coupled with the explicit desire to die. This vague reference to action, in context, implies an intention to carry out suicide, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""Let's just do it"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of a prior attempt). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit personal desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It exceeds 'Ideation' because of the expressed intention to act (""Let's just do it""), which, despite lacking a detailed plan or method, indicates an imminent intended action when combined with high intent and immediacy.
   - 'Behavior' is appropriate here because of the presence of suicidal desire and an intended action (vague but implied by ""do it"" in context), even without specifics.
   - 'Attempt' is not relevant as no past action is described.
   - Given the high imminence and intent, and no genuine uncertainty about the intended action after context consideration, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide-related content, including ""I'm going to attempt again"" (implying a future suicide attempt), ""I've tried to overdose three times"" (specific method and past actions), ""I want to die,"" and ""Goodbye"" (indicating farewell). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm just so tired,"" ""I give up""), self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and despair (""I don't want to get better""). Specific methods (overdose) and preparations are referenced, with high imminence (""Just a few more hours""). Past actions are clearly described (""tried to overdose three times,"" ""first attempt at the beginning of this year""). The author expresses a genuine desire to die, not unwanted thoughts (e.g., ""I choose not to get better"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related phrases like ""attempt again"" and ""I want to die,"" and it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""my mind wants to die""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are embraced.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a method is specified (""overdose"" from past attempts, implying a likely method for the future), and there is an intended action with high imminence (""I'm going to attempt again"" in ""a few more hours""). The ""Goodbye"" suggests preparation. This, coupled with explicit desire and imminence, indicates 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes both past initiated actions (""I've tried to overdose three times,"" ""my first attempt"") and a future intention (""I'm going to attempt again""). The past actions are specific, potentially lethal, and self-initiated, qualifying as 'Attempt' under the rules. The precedence rule states that if a past attempt is clearly described (even if historical and linked to current feelings), 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation or behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The detailed description of past suicide attempts (overdose) takes precedence per the rules, even with current behavior mentioned. 'Behavior' would apply if only future plans were present, but 'Attempt' is prioritized here due to the clear recounting of past initiated actions. The post links past attempts to current struggles (e.g., ""nobody noticed,"" ""People only care when your dead""), reinforcing 'Attempt' as the category.

And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes intense emotional distress (feeling stuck, guilt, grief, family estrangement, alcoholism) and expresses a desire for relief: ""I just want this pain to end."" 
   - There is **no explicit mention** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't anymore""), burdensomeness (""doing nothing for her""), and despair over traumatic life events. 
   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions** are present. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post **does not explicitly mention** suicide, ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases. 
   - Phrases like ""I just want this pain to end"" express a desire to escape suffering but **do not explicitly state a desire to die, cease living, or end life**. The focus is on stopping emotional pain, not on seeking death. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no negation of such thoughts. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No method, plan, tools, or preparations** are referenced. The post discusses life circumstances and emotions but lacks any indication of actionable steps toward suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes **ongoing distress** and past traumatic events (e.g., friend drowning, family issues) but **no description of past or imminent suicidal actions** by the author. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core sentiment (""I just want this pain to end"") reflects severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks a personal, explicit expression of suicidal desire or intent**. 
   - Without explicit suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""), a plan/method, or descriptions of past/planned actions, the post does not meet criteria for *Ideation*, *Behavior*, or *Attempt*. 
   - The content aligns with **Indicator**: expressing profound emotional pain and risk factors (e.g., trauma, isolation, alcoholism) without articulating a current, personal wish to die or suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I'm suicidal"".  
   - Temporal context: ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" implies imminence (within months).  
   - Emotional indicators: Despair from maternal rejection (""she smirked and rolled her eyes"").  
   - Desire to act: ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" expresses intent to end life.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation described.  
   - No past actions (attempts) mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm suicidal"".  
   - **Yes**: ""time for me to fucking go"" confirms personal desire to die.  
   - No negation of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, means).  
   - Temporal marker (""past this summer"") implies intent but lacks actionable details.  
   - **Vague intent with high imminence**: ""time for me to fucking go"" + rejection escalation suggests urgency, but no method/plan specified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** (""don’t think I’ll make it past this summer"").  
   - **No past initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""time to go"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/initiated self-harm.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - Strong desire and temporal imminence present, but **no method, plan, or preparation** mentioned (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""bridge"").  
     - ""Make it past this summer"" and ""time to go"" imply intent but remain **vague about action**.  
     - Rules state: Lean toward *Ideation* if ambiguity about plan/method exists.

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - **Key Elements:** The post contains multiple expressions of hopelessness (""It's over for me,"" ""I'm drowning in depression""), self-hatred (""I am trash,"" ""I'm a disgrace""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I should have killed myself,"" ""I promise I won't fail this time""). 
   - **Explicit Suicide Intent:** Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""I tried,"" ""I promise I won't fail this time,"" and ""Gonna be gone after this weekend."" There is a clear, unnegated desire to die (e.g., no statements rejecting the thoughts).
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation:** Specific methods are mentioned (""hanging is painless,"" ""I'm gonna buy the right stuff""). Preparations are stated (""Say my goodbyes,"" ""Gone after this weekend""), and imminence is high (""this weekend"").
   - **Past Actions:** References a past suicide attempt (""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"") but emphasizes a *future* plan (""I promise I won’t fail *this time*"").
   - **Temporal Context:** Focuses on imminent future action (""Gonna be gone after this weekend"") rather than solely recounting past events. The past attempt is noted but framed as a failed precursor to the current plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   Yes. Unambiguous personal desire to die (e.g., ""I should have killed myself,"" ""Gonna be gone"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   Yes. Specific method (""hanging""), preparation (""buy the right stuff,"" ""say my goodbyes""), and high imminence (""after this weekend"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   The post describes a *past* attempt (""tried"") but centers on a *future* plan with concrete steps. The past attempt is historical context; the primary risk is the imminent intended action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (Ideation/Behavior/Attempt threshold met).  
   - Plan/method (""hanging,"" ""buy the right stuff"") and preparation (""goodbyes"") with high imminence indicate **Behavior**.  
   - The past attempt (""tried"") would support **Attempt**, but the *current focus* is on imminent future action (""this time,"" ""this weekend""), making **Behavior** the priority.  
   - No ambiguity: Intent, plan, method, and imminence align with Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" multiple times, indicating direct suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It's not worth it""), despair (""I don't know what's wrong with me""), and a sense of farewell (""I'm sorry to the people,"" ""Adios"").
   - A plan is mentioned: ""planning on killing myself at 30 or 25,"" which specifies a future timeframe but lacks details on method, means, or preparations (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - The desire to die is conditional (""if I still feel the same or worse by the time I'm around that age"") and not immediate, with low imminence (""I still have a long time to rethink,"" ""update back in 8 yrs"").
   - There are no references to past actions or attempts; the focus is solely on future intentions.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die under certain conditions but also mentions the possibility of seeking help and rethinking decisions, indicating ambivalence rather than explicit negation of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""this life for me isn't it,"" ""Adios"") in a context of despair.
   - The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, they are presented as a conditional future option. Phrases like ""I can still seek out help"" show openness to alternatives but do not negate the underlying desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A vague plan is mentioned (""at 30 or 25""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or means is described.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are present.
   - The intent is coupled with low imminence (years away) and uncertainty (""Depends lol,"" ""No promises""), so even a vague reference to action does not imply an immediate method or plan. This aligns with Ideation rather than Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""planning"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. All references are hypothetical and conditional on future feelings.
   - No description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguous desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - However, the lack of a specific method, preparation, or high-imminence action means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The temporal plan (""at 30 or 25"") is not actionable or immediate.
   - With no past actions described, 'Attempt' is not relevant.
   - Despite the conditional nature, the core expression of suicidal thoughts and future-oriented desire fits 'Ideation'. Ambivalence (e.g., rethinking decisions) does not override the explicit intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post mentions ""suicide rate"" but in a statistical/societal context (""suicide rate for men""), not as a personal expression. The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" suggests emotional distress but is vague and metaphorical.
    - Emotional indicators include feeling perceived as a ""threat"" and societal pressure, but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden statements about the *self*. The focus is on societal observation (""I have so much respect for cismen"").
    - **No mentions** of death/dying/suicide/self-harm directed at the author, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The suicide reference is purely demographic.
    - No temporal context for personal risk (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
    - The author expresses distress about societal perceptions, **not** a personal desire to die or unwanted suicidal thoughts.

    - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases in a personal context. The term ""suicide rate"" is used abstractly.
    - **No expressions** of personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""), hatred of life, or wishing life would end. Phrases like ""teetering on the edge"" imply distress but **not** suicidal intent.
    - Since suicidal thoughts/desire are absent, no need to assess if they are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **None identified**. No references to methods, tools, locations, preparations, or intended actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - **No description** of past or current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, preparations). ""Teetering on the edge"" does not imply initiated self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses distress (feeling like a ""threat"") and references suicide statistically, but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**. 
    - ""Teetering on the edge"" is ambiguous but, without suicidal language or intent, aligns with general distress (Indicator). 
    - **Not Ideation**: No personal desire to die (e.g., ""I hate living"").  
    - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan, method, or past action.  
    - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: Abstract suicide discussion + distress without personal suicidal intent.

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post references suicide directly through the mother's statement (""suicide is a coward way to go out""). The author expresses imminent intent with ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" coupled with a farewell (""Peace out all"") and well-wishes to others. Emotional distress is evident (""Thanks mom"" sarcastically, "":(""). No specific method, plan details, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""gone within 24 hours"" implies impending action but lacks concrete steps. No past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: Indirect via quoting the mother, but the phrase ""I'm gone within 24 hours"" strongly implies personal suicidal intent in context.  
   - Clear desire to die: Yes (""I'm gone"" implies cessation of life, reinforced by despair and farewell).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) specified.  
   - However, ""gone within 24 hours"" indicates **high imminence** and **intended action**, which—coupled with explicit desire—implies a plan (even if vague). Rules note: With high imminence/intent, vague action references lean toward 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intention (""within 24 hours"").  
   - No past or initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die is present.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**:  
     - Strong desire and imminent intent (""within 24 hours"") with a farewell signal impending action.  
     - Though no method is specified, high imminence + intent + contextual farewell pushes this to 'Behavior' per guidelines (vague action references with intent/imminence qualify as Behavior).

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes childhood abuse, ongoing emotional manipulation, feelings of being trapped, self-hatred (""I hate myself for letting them do that""), and hopelessness (e.g., no proof for legal action, can't access counseling, parents preventing moving out). 
   - Key phrase: ""it's killing me"" – this is idiomatic, expressing severe emotional distress, not a literal reference to death or suicide. 
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include despair, helplessness, and being a burden (implied by self-blame), but no expressions of anhedonia or direct desire for life to end. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions. The focus is on seeking escape (e.g., wanting a restraining order) and external circumstances. 
   - No imminence of suicidal intent; the tone is about enduring pain, not acting on it. 
   - The writer's stated desire is to resolve the situation (e.g., ""I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order""), not to die. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to be gone"" or ""I hate living""). The phrase ""it's killing me"" is metaphorical and common in expressions of distress. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not present, so the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant. 
   - Conclusion: No explicit or implied suicidal intent; the distress is situational and non-suicidal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, guns), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). 
   - No vague references to action that could imply a plan, even in context of high distress. The writer discusses legal/escape desires, not self-harm. 
   - Since explicit desire to die is absent, this step doesn't apply. 
   - Conclusion: No evidence of plan, method, or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past abuse and manipulation, but no past suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, self-harm, or initiated lethal actions). 
   - Timeframe references (e.g., childhood, past interactions with authorities) are unrelated to self-harm. 
   - Conclusion: No indication of past or recent suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress, self-hatred, and hopelessness due to abuse, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, or intent. 
   - Strong emotional phrases like ""it's killing me"" are figurative and do not constitute suicidal ideation; they indicate severe emotional pain. 
   - No suicidal ideation is present, so it cannot escalate to Behavior or Attempt. 
   - Fits 'Indicator' category: distress about life circumstances without suicidal intent, and no mention of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted). 
   - Rules adhered to: Focus is solely on the author; no other categories fit.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of self-harm: ""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend,"" ""ended with my harming,"" ""I'm self harming again,"" ""I'm bloodying myself up now.""  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now and save time.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly""), guilt over broken promises.  
   - Method/plan: Vague reference to suicide (""kill myself"") but no specific method, tools, location, or preparations described.  
   - Imminence: ""now"" (in ""I should do it now"") indicates high immediacy.  
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""kill myself,"" ""do it now"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""do it now"" (referencing suicide) express unambiguous desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Self-harm (""bloodying myself up"") is mentioned but is distinct from suicidal intent. Suicide references lack details about means, location, or actionable steps (e.g., ""I have pills"" or ""going to the bridge"").  
   - **High imminence + vagueness**: ""I should do it now"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete plans. Guidelines state vague action references (e.g., ""do something"") require explicit intent *and* method/preparation to qualify as Behavior. Here, method remains undefined.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current self-harm** (non-suicidal injury) and **future suicidal intent** (""it’s a matter of time,"" ""I should do it now"").  
   - **No past suicide attempt**: Self-harm relapse is not equivalent to a suicide attempt (no lethal intent or action described).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") qualifies for Ideation. However, no plan/method/preparation exists despite high imminence (""now""). Vague intent (""do it"") without actionable details defaults to Ideation per guidelines.  
   - **No Indicator**: Suicidal desire is personal and explicit, not abstract or unwanted.  
   - **No Attempt**: No description of past/current initiated lethal action.  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong suicidal intent with imminence but no identifiable plan/method → **Ideation**.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of death and suicide, such as ""someone blow my head off"" (a specific method implying shooting), ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""im fucking done""), despair, self-loathing (""what people would think if they saw the real fucking me""), and feelings of deserving punishment. There is a specific method referenced (""blow my head off""), but no explicit mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring means) or past actions. The imminence is high due to phrases like ""im fucking done"" and the urgent plea ""please kill me."" The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, it is a genuine wish for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related phrases like ""blow my head off"" (a direct reference to self-inflicted gunshot) and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""i fucking deserve death,"" ""please kill me""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon; the desire is personal and affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned (""blow my head off""), which strongly implies a plan involving a firearm. While there are no details about preparations (e.g., having a weapon or writing a note), the method is explicit and coupled with high imminence and intent (e.g., ""im fucking done""). This qualifies as a plan/method element, leaning toward Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and future-oriented pleas (e.g., ""please kill me""), but no past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no references to attempts, such as ""I tried to"" or ""I took pills""). The content is focused on present distress and desires, not historical actions, so Attempt is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""I deserve death""), ruling out Indicator (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). The presence of a specific method (""blow my head off"") moves it beyond Ideation (which is for thoughts/desire without plan/method). With no past initiated actions, Attempt is not relevant. Thus, the combination of desire, method, and high imminence fits Behavior best.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now,"" which are explicit references to suicide or self-inflicted death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""my only option""), anxiety about the future, and despair about long-term survival (e.g., ""it won't work out long term""). There is a stated desire for life to end as a solution to problems (""this wouldn't be a problem""). No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The action is hypothetical and conditional (""if I ended my life""), with no reference to past actions. Imminence is implied with ""right now,"" but it's framed as a possibility rather than a definite plan. The writer expresses a genuine desire to die to escape their situation, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life,"" which are direct expressions of suicidal intent. It also expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""if I ended my life right now this wouldn't be a problem""). There is no negation of these thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so the desire is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) is mentioned. References to action are vague (e.g., ""ended my life"") and lack concrete details. While imminence is high with ""right now,"" the conditional ""if"" and absence of a plan or method mean this does not meet the threshold for Behavior. The context shows intent but not actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions and hypothetical actions (""if I ended my life right now""), not past events. No description of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of prior attempts) is present, so Attempt does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""ended my life"") rules out Indicator, as there is no ambiguity about personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts. The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as Behavior, despite the high imminence. With no past actions described, Attempt is not applicable. Therefore, the post fits Ideation, as it expresses a personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no indication of a plan or imminent action.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide attempts (""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up""). It expresses a strong desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up""). Emotional indicators like hopelessness, self-hatred, and feeling like a burden are present. Specific methods (overdosing on pills) and a recent, initiated action are described. Timeframe is immediate (""yesterday,"" ""last 4 days""). The desire to die is genuine and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""end it all."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, they are acted upon.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (taking ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers""), and it is tied to a recent, initiated action. This is not just a plan or preparation but a described behavior that was carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: the author took a large quantity of pills ""yesterday"" with the intent to die, which constitutes a suicide attempt. The action is recent (within the last 4 days) and is clearly linked to the author's current state. This meets the criteria for 'Attempt' as it is a concrete, initiated action, regardless of its recency.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of a described past suicidal action (""Attempt"") takes precedence over current ideation or behavior. The author details a specific, lethal action they initiated, which aligns with the 'Attempt' definition (a past or recent self-initiated action). Expressions of desire to die (""Ideation"") and method/action details (""Behavior"") are present but are secondary to the clear description of an attempt. There is no ambiguity; the action is explicitly stated, so 'Attempt' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being trapped (""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse,"" ""I have nothing""). It details systemic grievances, personal isolation, family rejection, and victimization. However, there is **no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations**. The focus is on external circumstances causing suffering, not a desire to end life. Phrases like ""life is a total curse"" convey deep distress but lack explicit suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent terms.  
   - **No clear desire to die** expressed (e.g., ""I want to disappear,"" ""I wish I were dead""). Distress centers on unfairness and suffering, not a wish for life to end.  
   - **No references to suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No implied or explicit plans, methods (tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past or recent self-harm/suicidal actions** described (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or initiated actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **intense distress, hopelessness, and victimization** but **lacks personal desire for death, suicidal ideation, plans, or past actions**.  
   - Key phrases (""life is a curse,"" ""I have nothing"") reflect existential despair but **do not cross into explicit suicidal desire** per guidelines (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be Ideation; here, it is generalized).

   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm feeling suicidal,"" ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" ""I feel the only escape to this situation is suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""scared,"" ""panic attacks,"" ""not able to sleep,"" ""feel like a burden,"" intense distress about impending consequences.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" ""how not to be a coward and jump away,"" ""stay on the tracks.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""all I have left""), despair (""my whole story is too much""), feeling like a burden (""nobody would care""), self-blame (""fucked up something good"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Explicitly references jumping in front of a train (""Amtrak or Metrolink""), knows the train schedule (""I know the train schedule""), and describes past actions (""times I have tried"").  
   - Past actions: Describes initiated suicide attempts where they backed out (""jump away at the last minute"").  
   - Imminence: No explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but method is highly specific and rehearsed.  
   - Desire: Expresses conflict (""I really do not want to do this"") but affirms intent (""this is all I have left"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I know the way I will end it,"" ""suicide ideation,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak,"" ""how do I stay on the tracks?"" Desire is not negated (the ""do not want"" refers to hurting others, not personal desire to live).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (train), knowledge of schedule (""know the train schedule""), and repeated rehearsals (""jump away at the last minute"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past initiated action**: Explicitly describes prior attempts (""times I have tried... jump away at the last minute""). This qualifies as an *initiated, potentially lethal action* (interrupted by self).  
   - **Current intent**: Affirms ongoing plans (train method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author describes **past self-initiated, potentially lethal actions** (attempts where they backed out) and links them to current struggles. Per the rules, *'Attempt' takes precedence* if a past action is clearly described by the author, regardless of recency.

   - Mentions feelings of being a burden, severe isolation (not leaving home for 9 years), unemployment, dependency, and inactivity.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (implied by stagnation) and perceived burden.  
   - **No explicit references** to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - No expressions of desire to die, end life, or escape via suicide.  
   - No temporal markers suggesting imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or historical attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents.  
   - **No expressions of desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to be gone,"" ""I hate living"").  
   - While ""I'm a burden"" is a known risk factor for suicidal ideation, it is **not inherently a suicidal statement** and lacks personal desire for death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. No tools, locations, plans, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes chronic life circumstances (isolation, unemployment) but **no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Distress is evident** (burden, isolation), but there is **no explicit/unwanted suicidal thought, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt**.  
   - Phrases like ""I'm a burden"" alone do not equate to *personal* suicidal desire; they indicate severe distress and risk factors but fall under **Indicator** without clearer intent.  
   - No ambiguity requiring escalation: Absence of suicidal language rules out Ideation/Behavior/Attempt.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there.

I can't anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""commit"" (euphemism for suicide), researching ""tall bridges"" (method/plan), drafting ""suicide notes"" (preparation), and expressing hopelessness (""It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway,"" ""I can't anymore""). 
   - Explicit suicide/death intent: ""commit when i get home"" indicates a clear desire to die, and ""suicide notes"" confirms suicidal intent. No negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specific method implied (""tall bridges"" and ""a few methods to try""), and explicit preparation (""drafted my suicide notes""). Imminence is moderate (""when i get home"" – future but planned).
   - Temporal context/action: Describes future intentions and current preparations, not past actions. No mention of past attempts or initiated actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are present, but overshadowed by explicit suicidal planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, ""commit"" and ""suicide notes"" are direct references to suicide, and the desire is not negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, ""researching tall bridges"" implies a method, ""a few methods to try"" indicates consideration of specific means, and ""drafted my suicide notes"" is clear preparation. Coupled with intent (""It's settled""), this points to behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Focuses on future actions (""commit when i get home"") and current preparations, not past events. No description of initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Not 'Indicator': Explicit personal desire to die is present, and thoughts are not unwanted.
   - Not 'Ideation': Desire to die is coupled with a plan (""tall bridges,"" ""methods"") and preparation (""drafted suicide notes"").
   - Not 'Attempt': No past or recent initiated lethal actions described.
   - 'Behavior' fits: The post includes explicit suicidal desire, specific methods (even if not fully detailed), and preparations, with future intent. Imminence (""when i get home"") is not immediate but planned, and the context shows resolved intent (""It's settled"").

Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""end it all,"" ""kill myself"" (implied by ""commit lifen't""), ""end it,"" ""options to end it all.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one worth staying alive for""), relief (""weight off my chest,"" ""blessing"").  
   - Plans/preparations: ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" ""once I'm ready... I'll make my decision.""  
   - Imminence: Planning phase (""looking into options,"" ""getting ducks in a row""), no fixed timeline but clear intent to act.  
   - Desire: Strong personal desire to die (""finally free to end it all""), with a caveat about possibly not acting but emphasizing the need for the option.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""end it all,"" ""commit lifen't,"" ""end it"" are explicit suicidal phrases. Desire is clear (""I’m finally free to end it all""). The caveat (""possibility I’ll opt not to"") does not negate the current desire/preparation; it reinforces intent by framing suicide as a viable ""option.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Looking into my options"" implies researching methods. ""Getting my ducks in a row"" signals concrete preparations (e.g., organizing affairs). ""Once I’m ready... I’ll make my decision"" indicates intended action. No specific method is named, but preparation + intent + imminence (""finally moving forward"") aligns with Behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intentions** (""I’m looking into,"" ""I’ll make my decision""). No past actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + preparations (""getting ducks in a row"") = **Behavior**.  
   - Caveat about possibly not acting is outweighed by active planning and relief at having ""obstacles out of the way.""  
   - No past initiated lethal action (ruling out Attempt).  
   - Preparations distinguish this from Ideation (which lacks planning/action).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - **No** preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - **No** imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") or vague action tied to intent (e.g., ""make the pain physical"" is absent).  
   - Assisted suicide mention is abstract advocacy, not a personal plan.

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""Gonna end myself soon,"" indicating imminent suicidal intent.  
   - It specifies a method (""OD on"") and exact means (""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac""), showing preparation (possession of substances).  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""end myself""), and the timeframe (""soon"") suggests high imminence.  
   - No mention of past actions or explicit negation of desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""End myself"" is a direct phrase synonymous with suicide.  
   - The phrase expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""Gonna end myself soon"").  
   - No statements suggest unwanted thoughts (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Overdosing (OD) is explicitly stated.  
   - Specific means/tools: Quantities of Benadryl and Prozac are mentioned, confirming possession/preparation.  
   - Imminence (""soon"") coupled with concrete plans solidifies this as actionable intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post describes a *future* intention (""gonna,"" ""soon""), not a past event.  
   - No description of a prior initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - ""End myself"" confirms suicidal intent beyond vague distress (rules out *Indicator*).  
   - Possession of means and OD plan moves beyond passive thoughts (rules out *Ideation*).  
   - No past/initiated lethal action described (rules out *Attempt*).

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of self-harm/suicide: ""had a knife to my wrist 3x,"" ""imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood,"" ""suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Loneliness, feeling like an inconvenience, hopelessness (""just don't fit in,"" ""better off without me"").  
   - Specific method: Knife to wrist (3 times, though not completed).  
   - Past actions: Self-initiated placement of a knife to the wrist on three occasions, with cessation each time.  
   - Stated desire: Explicit desire to act (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and frustration at not completing (""feel like a coward"").  
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""need to do it"" (suicide), imagining death (""dead in a pool of blood""), and self-criticism for not acting show a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Knife to the wrist.  
   - Preparations: Physical action of placing the knife to the wrist (3 times).  
   - Imminence/intent: Repeated attempts to initiate the act and expressed intent (""need to do it"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past self-initiated actions**: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x"" (initiated but stopped). This qualifies as a potentially lethal action that was physically started.  
   - Timeframe: Historical (not specified as recent, but author links it to current feelings of cowardice and desire).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + method (knife) + preparations (placing knife to wrist) would typically suggest **Behavior**.  
   - However, the post describes **past initiated actions** (placing knife to wrist with intent) that were halted. This meets the definition of **Attempt** (""self-initiated actions... potentially lethal, even if interrupted"").  
   - Rule: **Attempt takes precedence** if a past initiated action is described, regardless of recency. Here, the author explicitly references three past actions they initiated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of guilt (""I have done fucked up stuff""), self-doubt (""I am not entirely a good person""), and a desperate need for love/validation (""I really need to feel loved""). Crucially, it explicitly states, ""I would like to feel that before I kill myself."" This directly references suicide as a personal future action. There are no mentions of specific methods, preparations, or timelines beyond ""before I kill myself."" No past suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. The phrase ""kill myself"" is an explicit, direct reference to suicide. The statement expresses a personal desire to die (""before I kill myself"") without negation (e.g., no indication these thoughts are unwanted or that the author doesn’t wish to act on them).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No. While suicide is explicitly mentioned as an intended outcome (""before I kill myself""), there is no description of a method (e.g., pills, gun), location, preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means), or imminent timeframe beyond the vague ""before"" conditional. The conditional nature (""before I kill myself"") suggests action is contingent on unmet emotional needs, not an immediate plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post references a *future* intention (""before I kill myself"") but describes no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (""kill myself""), satisfying the threshold for **Ideation** or higher.  
   - No plan/method/preparation is mentioned (only a conditional future intent), ruling out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The suicidal thought is personal and desired (not explicitly unwanted), ruling out **Indicator**.  
   The absence of actionable details beyond intent confirms **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide: Explicitly states ""the thought of suicide"" as a current problem. Phrases like ""Fuck life, I'm out"" and ""You can't fix that shit"" imply despair but no direct action.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""entire life will be filled with misery""), worthlessness (""feel unwanted""), isolation (""can't tell anyone""), and anhedonia (""not motivated to do anything"").
   - Plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. No references to specific means, locations, timelines, or preparatory actions.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts or self-harm.
   - Imminence: No urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
   - Desire: Expresses suicidal thoughts as an unsolvable problem but does not state a *desire* to act on them or a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention: ""suicide"" is directly referenced (""the thought of suicide"").
   - Desire to die: No explicit statement of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The phrase ""Fuck life, I'm out"" is ambiguous but leans toward frustration, not a clear death wish.
   - Unwanted thoughts: The framing (""You can't fix that shit"") suggests distress about suicidal thoughts without indicating a *personal desire* to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - No implied action or imminence (e.g., ""planning to,"" vague references to harm).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted"").
   - Focus is on *current thoughts* of suicide, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" and despair (""entire life filled with misery"") suggests personal ideation.
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out 'Behavior'.
   - **No past/current initiated lethal action** → Rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as an unwanted burden (""You can't fix that shit""), but the absence of explicit negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"") and the direct personal reference to ""suicide"" leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Indicator'. Phrases like ""Fuck life, I'm out"" support this by implying a wish to escape life.

350,"I think my time on this earth is coming to an end in the next month or two. It's like when a cat knows they're dying and they go into some dark corner to die. That's almost how I feel. I know I'm at the end. I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore. When you're so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders, that's how I feel with life and its pain. For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did. Some people just aren't meant for this world, and that's okay. My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I can't fight anymore""), exhaustion (""eyelids feel as heavy as boulders""), acceptance of death (""some people just aren't meant for this world"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: Timeframe (""next month or two"") implies intention but no specific method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) are mentioned. The cat metaphor suggests withdrawal/isolation but not actionable planning.  
   - Past actions: None described.  
   - Imminence: ""next month or two"" indicates future intent but lacks urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish for death as relief (""My death will release my pain... once and for all"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but desire for death is clear (""my time... coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain""). No negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - Timeframe (""next month or two"") suggests intent but lacks concrete plan, method, or preparation. The metaphor is descriptive, not actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Focuses on future intention (""coming to an end""). No past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"") described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Strong expressions of desire to die (""I know I'm at the end,"" ""release my pain"") confirm *Ideation*. Absence of unwanted thoughts negation rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** No method/preparation (e.g., pills, location) or vague actionable intent (e.g., ""I’ll make it stop soon"") despite timeframe. Timeframe alone without method/plan leans *Ideation*.  
   - **Attempt:** No past/recent initiated lethal action described.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it.""  
   - Specific method/means: ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills.""  
   - Preparations: ""about to lock myself,"" indicating imminent action.  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""run out of options,"" ""rock bottom""), guilt (""feel awful""), fear of consequences (""scared of the pain I will cause"").  
   - Timeframe/imminence: ""It's currently 6 in the morning,"" ""about to,"" indicating immediate intent.  
   - Desire to die: ""I'm ready to do it,"" despite conflicted feelings (""I don't want to do this but I've run out of options"").  
   - No past attempts described; only historical struggles (e.g., mental breakdown in 2019).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** Direct phrases: ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""do it"" (contextually refers to suicide).  
   - **Yes.** Clear desire: ""I'm ready to do it,"" even with ambivalence (""I don't want to"" is overridden by ""run out of options"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **Yes.** Specific method: ""knife and some pills.""  
   - **Yes.** Preparation and location: ""lock myself in the bathroom.""  
   - High imminence: ""about to"" at the current time (6 AM).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **future intention** (""about to"") with no mention of past initiated suicidal actions.  
   - Historical context (e.g., mental breakdown) lacks any reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) **plus** specific method, preparation, and high imminence → **Behavior**.  
   - Ambivalence (""I don't want to"") does not negate intent given explicit plan and imminent action.  
   - No past initiated lethal action → rules out 'Attempt'.

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS: Key elements**
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" – explicit reference to suicidal thoughts.
   - States ""I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day"" – indicates recurrent consideration of suicide methods, but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is detailed.
   - Emotional indicators: ""no interest in modern life"" (anhedonia), ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"" (despair, hopelessness), and general distress about worsening mental health.
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, or suicide-specific actions (e.g., self-harm, acquiring means, writing notes).
   - No preparations, plans, or imminent intentions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions initiated by the author.
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as persistent and intrusive (""constantly,"" ""over 100 times a day"") but not explicitly stated as unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to die""). The focus is on the thoughts themselves and their frequency.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" which implies a personal connection to suicidal ideation.
   - Expresses a desire for life to end indirectly through the context of persistent suicidal thoughts and depression, but no direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive."" However, ""suicidal thoughts"" inherently convey a current personal element of suicidal intent.
   - No explicit negation of the thoughts (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to act on them). The author describes them as a worrying, constant experience, but without rejection.
   - Therefore, this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation' or higher due to the explicit personal suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - ""Contemplate method"" indicates thinking about methods, but it is vague and nonspecific (no tools, locations, or substances mentioned). The word ""contemplate"" suggests cognitive consideration rather than planning or intention to act.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or intended action (e.g., ""I will do it"").
   - Imminence is not present (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""); the focus is on frequency of thoughts, not impending action.
   - Despite the high frequency (""over 100 times a day""), there is no indication that the author has moved beyond thought to intention or planning. Vague contemplation of method, without imminence or context implying action, does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current, ongoing thoughts (""constantly,"" ""each year has got worse""), with no reference to past or recent actions initiated by the author (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). The mention of ""contemplate"" is cognitive and present-tense, not behavioral.
   - No description of a past suicide attempt or self-initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because the post includes explicit personal suicidal thoughts without negation (not described as unwanted or abstract). Phrases like ""suicidal thoughts constantly"" indicate a genuine current personal desire or thought about suicide.
   - 'Behavior' is not applicable because, although a method is contemplated, it is vague and lacks any element of planning, preparation, intended action, or imminence. The word ""contemplate"" denotes thought, not behavior or intent to act. Uncertainty about plan/method exists, so 'Ideation' is preferred.
   - 'Attempt' does not apply as no past or recent self-initiated actions are described.
   - The core content is explicit suicidal thoughts with method consideration, but no plan or action. This fits 'Ideation', defined as expressions of suicidal thoughts or desire to die without specific plans, methods, or preparations.

So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and trauma from sexual assault, family betrayal, and isolation. Phrases like ""I hate it so much,"" ""I feel so trapped,"" and ""I feel like I have no choice"" indicate despair. Crucially, it includes: ""I just want to die."" There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past suicide attempts. The phrase ""I want to be saved"" and ""I've been trying to save myself"" suggest a desire for rescue, not active planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Explicit Mention**: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - **Desire to Die**: Yes, ""I just want to die"" is a clear, personal expression of a desire for life to end. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  
   - **Unwanted Thoughts**: Not present. The desire is stated without ambivalence.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - **Method/Plan**: None mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances).  
   - **Preparation**: None described (e.g., no notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means).  
   - **Imminence/Intent**: While distress is acute (""I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th""), there is no indication of immediate action tied to suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - **Past Actions**: Describes historical trauma (e.g., assault, family neglect) but **no mention of past self-harm or suicide attempts**.  
   - **Current/Future Intent**: Expresses desire to die but no description of initiated or planned actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - ""I just want to die"" confirms **active personal desire to die**, placing this beyond *Indicator* (which requires explicitly unwanted thoughts or no suicidal desire).  
   - Absence of method, plan, preparation, or imminent intent rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"") rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Ideation** best fits: clear desire to die with no actionable plan or behavior.

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions a specific suicidal method: ""driving 100 mph into a tree.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" hopelessness about self-worth.
   - Explicitly describes a current intention: ""sitting in my car right now thinking of..."" with high imminence (""right now"").
   - Expresses conflict about seeking help due to fear of hospitalization but does *not* negate the desire to act on suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I won't do it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a clear, lethal method implying a desire to die. Phrases like ""I don't know what to do"" contextualize this as despair-driven intent. No explicit negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"" is absent).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method: ""driving 100 mph into a tree.""
   - Preparation/Imminence: Actively ""sitting in my car right now"" while thinking of this action, indicating immediate means and location.
   - Coupled with explicit desire (Step 2), this confirms actionable intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a *current/future* intention (""thinking of..."") with high imminence (""right now""). No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried this yesterday"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die is present (Ideation threshold met).
   - Specific method (car crash) and imminent intent (""right now"") elevate this to Behavior.
   - No past actions described, so Attempt does not apply.
   - Distress about hospitalization does not negate the active plan/method, so Indicator is inappropriate.
   - Vague plan ambiguity is absent; method is concrete and contextually actionable.

Conclusion: **Behavior** (suicidal intent + specific plan/method + imminent intent).

I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""I've struggled with suicide before,"" ""I was hospitalised for it,"" ""I will be joining her [after mum passes],"" and ""sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound regret, self-hatred (""I hate myself so much""), hopelessness (""I dont see any future ahead for me""), and fear of imminent loss (mother's death in ""final couple of weeks"").  
   - Specific plans/preparations: No explicit method, tool, or location, but strong temporal link to mother's passing (""once my mum passes I will be joining her"").  
   - Past actions: Explicitly references a prior suicide attempt requiring hospitalization (""I was hospitalised for it previously"").  
   - Imminence: Suicide intent is tied to a near-future event (mother's death in weeks).  
   - Desire to die: Clear personal desire expressed (""I will be joining her,"" ""pain I will cause with my passing"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""I will be joining her"" directly links the author’s death to the mother’s passing, and ""pain I will cause with my passing"" confirms personal suicidal intent. No negation of desire is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., note-writing) mentioned. However, the statement ties intent to a concrete future event (mother’s death), implying a temporal plan. Despite this, the *absence* of actionable steps (method/location) leans away from Behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past action**: Explicitly describes a prior suicide attempt (""hospitalised for it"") initiated by the author.  
   - **Future intent**: Expresses desire to die after mother’s death but no initiated action yet.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author’s **past hospitalization for suicide** is a clear, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (regardless of timeframe), meeting the 'Attempt' criteria.  
   - Current expressions of desire (""I will be joining her"") and hopelessness support ongoing risk but do not override the confirmed past attempt.  
   - **'Attempt' takes precedence** over Ideation/Behavior when a past suicidal action is explicitly described by the author, even alongside current distress.  
   - No specific plan/method for future intent, so Ideation applies to current thoughts, but Attempt supersedes due to historical action.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""so hopeless""), feeling overwhelmed by mental battles, and exhaustion (""tired of living""). 
   - Key phrases: ""wake up even more tired of living,"" ""I don’t have much time left before I have to stop it,"" and ""Nothing makes it go away."" 
   - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. ""Stop it"" is vague and could imply ending emotional pain but lacks specificity about suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators dominate: despair, worthlessness (""I feel so stupid,"" ""so weak""), and anhedonia (""Nothing changes""). 
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions. Timeframe for distress is ongoing since the breakup (6 months ago). 
   - ""I have to stop it"" suggests a desire to end suffering, but not explicitly to die or act on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a wish to die. 
   - ""Tired of living"" expresses exhaustion but **not a clear desire to die**; it’s framed as a consequence of emotional pain. 
   - ""I have to stop it"" is ambiguous—could mean ending distress, not necessarily life. No suicidal thoughts are mentioned, wanted or unwanted. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, substances, plans, or preparations for self-harm. ""Stop it"" is too vague to imply a method or action. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes ongoing distress (""last few months,"" ""every night"") but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no mention of attempts, self-injury, or initiated lethal behavior). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks a personal, explicit desire to die** (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""stop it"" are concerning but ambiguous; they align more with despair than active suicidal intent. 
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No past/current suicidal actions rule out 'Attempt'. 
   - Strong emotional suffering without suicidal desire or ideation fits **'Indicator'**. While ""I have to stop it"" is worrisome, it’s not specific enough to indicate suicidal ideation after considering context (focus is on ending mental anguish, not life).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts. It expresses hopelessness (""I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have""), despair (""I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't""), anhedonia (loss of interest in cooking, cleaning, art), and a sense of futility (""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed""). The phrase ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" implies a desire for non-existence.
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts; ""contemplate suicide"" refers to ongoing thoughts, not initiated behavior.
   - No indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"" in relation to acting on thoughts).
   - The desire: Suicidal thoughts are expressed (""contemplate suicide"") but not explicitly stated as unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). The sentiment leans toward a genuine, though passive, wish to not be alive.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in ""constantly contemplate suicide.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire for life to end with ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all,"" which, in context, implies a personal wish to not exist.
   - No, the writer does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; the contemplation is presented as a current state without negation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - No vague references to action with high imminence (e.g., no phrases like ""do something"" coupled with immediate intent).
   - The focus is on thoughts and feelings, not on planning or acting.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""constantly contemplate suicide"") but no past or recent suicidal actions. References to the past (e.g., ""I used to have dreams"") relate to life changes, not suicide attempts.
   - No description of any self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of ""contemplate suicide"" and desire to not be alive (""not be here at all"") indicates personal suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no explicit desire).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. The lack of imminence or action elements supports this.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The post fits 'Ideation' best: it expresses a current personal desire to die or for life to end, with suicidal thoughts, but without any indication of a plan, method, or action.

I'm not looking for sympathy or compassion really I'm just looking to know if anyone else feels like the release is better as their life is a bust. To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the phrase ""When to know if suicide is better."" It describes long-term distress (trauma, OCD, anhedonia, abuse, no friends) and hopelessness (""all I have is that,"" ""life is a bust""). The term ""the release"" implies death as an escape, but this is framed as a question about others' feelings, not a personal declaration. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The author references suffering from age 12-13 to now (age 20) but no past suicidal actions or attempts. The core sentiment is questioning whether suicide is preferable, seeking validation from others (""I'm just looking to know if anyone else feels""), without expressing a current, personal intent to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned. However, the desire to die is not personally affirmed; it is presented hypothetically (""if suicide is better"") and comparatively (""if anyone else feels like the release is better""). Phrases like ""life is a bust"" convey despair but are not direct expressions of a wish to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The author does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted, but the framing as a question and the focus on others' experiences reduce the personal immediacy. Thus, while suicide is discussed, the personal desire to die is ambiguous and not explicit.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The post is contemplative, with no indication of intended action or imminence. The phrase ""the release"" is vague and not tied to any plan. Without a clear method or preparatory step, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past and ongoing suffering but no past suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, self-harm, or initiated behaviors). The discussion is focused on current feelings and hypothetical questions, not historical events involving suicidal acts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress and abstract discussion of suicide but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent; instead, it's ""if suicide is better""). Suicidal thoughts are present but framed as a question about others, not an affirmation of the author's intent. With no plan, method, or preparation, and no described past actions, 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are ruled out. 'Ideation' requires explicit personal desire (e.g., ""I hate living""), but here the desire is ambiguous and contextualized as seeking peer validation. Following the guidance—""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation, only choose Indicator if there's genuine ambiguity about personal suicidal desire""—this fits 'Indicator'. The primary content is distress and hopelessness, with suicidal references abstract or comparative, not personally actionable.

359,I wanna go sleep. I have 58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel / 58pcs of viepax 150 mg and viepax 75mg I wanna go sleep forever can't take this shit no more I'm sick and tired of my shitty life,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses a desire to ""go sleep forever,"" which is a euphemism for death or suicide, indicating a wish for life to end. Emotional indicators include ""can't take this shit no more"" and ""sick and tired of my shitty life,"" showing despair and hopelessness.
   - Specific methods/means are mentioned: possession of ""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel,"" ""58pcs of viepax 150 mg,"" and ""viepax 75mg,"" which are medications that could be used for a lethal overdose. This suggests the author has access to means for self-harm.
   - There are no references to past actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts). The focus is on current feelings and possession of means.
   - Imminence is implied through phrases like ""can't take this shit no more,"" indicating high distress and potential urgency, though no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.
   - The writer's stated desire (""I wanna go sleep forever"") is a clear expression of a personal wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""go sleep forever"" is an explicit metaphor for death, conveying a strong desire to not be alive. Phrases like ""sick and tired of my shitty life"" reinforce this intent.
   - There is no negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), so the desire appears genuine and personal. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (overdose using seroquel and viepax) is strongly implied by the detailed listing of medications and quantities, which are means for a potentially lethal act.
   - Possession of these medications constitutes preparation, as the author has acquired the tools for self-harm.
   - Coupled with the explicit desire to die and high distress, this indicates an intended action, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and possession of means, with no mention of any past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to having taken pills or survived an attempt). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes an explicit personal desire to die (""I wanna go sleep forever""), meeting the threshold for 'Ideation' or higher.
   - However, the mention of specific medications and quantities adds a clear element of method and preparation, elevating this to 'Behavior'. The context (high distress and possession of means) supports that this is not just ideation but involves planning or intended action.
   - There is no ambiguity about the method being implied for suicidal purposes, and no past action is described to warrant 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Behavior' as it combines suicidal desire with evidence of means and preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit statements like ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive,"" which indicate a desire for death or life to end. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm stuck in a loveless marriage with no way out""), despair (""I'm depressed and I'm miserable""), and feeling like a burden (""It's not fair to people to have to deal with me""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., attempts). No timeframe for imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is provided. The desire to die is expressed personally and directly, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use the word ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I want to die"") and for life to end (""I'm tired of being alive""). These phrases, in the context of despair, constitute a clear personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted, so this leans towards 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye) are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional distress and desire without any reference to planning or intended action, even vaguely. High imminence is absent (e.g., no ""soon"" or ""now""). Therefore, there is no evidence to support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts like ""I tried to overdose""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expressions of desire to die (""I want to die"") and weariness of life (""I'm tired of being alive"") indicate personal suicidal ideation. Since there is no plan, method, preparation, or intended action described, this falls under 'Ideation'. The lack of any indication that thoughts are unwanted rules out 'Indicator'. No past actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' is inapplicable, and the absence of a plan means 'Behavior' is not appropriate.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide attempts: ""tried and bailed out multiple times,"" specifically ""tried with a knife.""  
   - Expresses strong current desire: ""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it,"" ""I want this to end.""  
   - Describes suicidal methods: knife (past), rope (current possession), and location (building).  
   - Notes preparation: ""I have a rope.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""scared,"" hopelessness about continuing life.  
   - Imminence: Urgency in ""I have to do it,"" ""should’ve done it a long time ago.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I want this to end"" (referring to life/suffering), reinforced by ""I have to do it.""  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific methods: knife (past attempt), rope (current possession).  
   - Location: ""building"" (though hesitation noted).  
   - Preparation: ""I have a rope.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions**: Explicitly describes self-initiated, potentially lethal attempts (""tried with a knife"").  
   - **Current intent**: Strong desire to act now (""don’t want to bail out anymore""), coupled with method (rope).  
   - **Key**: Past attempts (""tried with a knife"") are clear, potentially lethal actions initiated by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempt (""tried with a knife"") is explicitly stated and self-initiated, meeting the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - Current elements (rope, building, urgency) suggest concurrent 'Behavior,' **but 'Attempt' takes precedence** per rules: Historical attempts described by the author override concurrent ideation/behavior.  
   - ""Tried with a knife"" is unambiguous as an initiated lethal action, regardless of timeframe.

A fly is worth more than i am. all they do is look for food and reproduce, i cant even do that. im useless.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""No point to anything""), worthlessness (""most useless pos""), and despair. Critically, it includes the phrase ""i just want to end it,"" which implies a desire for life to end. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. References to depression and emotional pain contextualize the distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""End it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide/death in this context of despair.  
   - The phrase expresses a clear personal desire to cease living (""I just want to end it""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Explicit desire to die is present (Yes).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of specific tools, locations, substances, or methods.  
   - No references to preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) or intended actions beyond the vague ""end it.""  
   - **Conclusion**: No plan/method/preparation identified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""I feel pain,"" ""want to end it now"").  
   - No description of past actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").  
   - **Conclusion**: No past or recent initiated suicidal action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit desire to die (""end it"") and hopelessness (""no point to anything"") confirm *Ideation*. The thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing intrusions (which would be Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, ruling out Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past self-initiated actions.  
   - **Final Fit**: 'Ideation' – clear desire to die with no actionable plan.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses a desire not to wake up tomorrow, implying a wish for death. It references a past suicide attempt with ""attempt properly again"" and anticipates future depression from Christmas not happening. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""But I will, as always""), despair, and loneliness. No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned for any current or future action. The temporal context includes a future wish (not waking up tomorrow) and a conditional future intent (attempting again if depressed), but crucially, it explicitly describes a past self-initiated action (""attempt... again"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a clear personal desire to die, and ""attempt properly again"" confirms suicidal intent. There is no negation of these thoughts (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted), so it is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, or preparation is mentioned for any current or future action. The phrase ""attempt properly again"" is vague and refers to a past event or conditional future intent without detailing means. Therefore, no current 'Behavior' elements are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past action: ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a self-initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action by the author in the past (the word ""again"" confirms this). This is mentioned in the context of current feelings (e.g., hopelessness about waking up, loneliness) and potential future ideation. The historical nature does not disqualify it, as per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of a described past suicide attempt (""attempt... again"") takes precedence, as 'Attempt' is defined to include historical self-initiated actions when mentioned by the author. Current expressions of desire (e.g., not waking up) and conditional future intent (attempting again) do not override this, as the past action is clearly stated. There is no plan or method for current/future actions, so 'Behavior' does not apply. The desire to die confirms it is not 'Indicator', and the lack of current plan/method means it is not 'Behavior' or solely 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Explicit requests for someone to ""kill me"" and ""chop me up,"" with the goal to ensure the body is never found.
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation to remain undiscovered by family, implying hopelessness and burden.
   - Plan/method/preparation: Specific method (""chop me up""), preparations (""hide my body""), and intent to avoid discovery.
   - Imminence: No explicit timeframe, but the plea (""looking for someone"") suggests urgency.
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""kill me"") with no negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Direct phrases: ""kill me"" is an explicit death wish.
   - Desire to die: ""I am happy for u to chop me up"" confirms active acceptance of lethal action.
   - No negation: Unwanted thoughts are not expressed; the author actively facilitates their death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Method: ""chop me up"" specifies a violent means.
   - Preparation: ""hide my body"" and ensuring the body is ""never found again"" indicate concrete logistical planning.
   - Intent + method: Coupled with the explicit death wish, this confirms actionable intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a future intention (""looking for someone"") with planned actions (killing/hiding). No past or initiated actions are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Ruled out ""Indicator"": Explicit personal death wish and facilitation of suicide.
   - Ruled out ""Ideation"": Specific method/preparation elevates beyond mere desire.
   - Ruled out ""Attempt"": No description of past/initiated self-harm.
   - ""Behavior"" fits: Explicit desire to die + stated method (""chop me up"") + preparations (""hide my body"").

Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" indicating explicit references to suicide. Emotional indicators include ""fed up,"" ""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" and frustration with the ongoing struggle. There is no mention of specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. The writer references a 10-year history of dealing with these thoughts but no past actions or attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Imminence is low, with phrases like ""some days I consider it"" suggesting intermittent consideration rather than immediate intent. Crucially, the writer explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die,"" indicating that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and not aligned with a genuine personal wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" so there is a direct reference to suicide/death. However, the writer negates any desire to act on these thoughts with the phrase ""I have no desire to die."" This explicit negation, combined with descriptions of fighting and suppressing the thoughts, shows that the suicidal ideation is unwanted and not an expression of a current personal desire to die. Therefore, this leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - There is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note). The content focuses solely on thoughts and fantasies, with no indication of intended action. Phrases like ""consider it"" are vague and do not imply a concrete plan or imminent behavior. With no plan/method and low imminence, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a 10-year history of suicidal thoughts but no past or recent self-initiated actions. Statements like ""fighting down suicidal thoughts,"" ""I fight to suppress them,"" and ""I'm still here"" emphasize prevention rather than action. There is no description of any initiated suicide attempt (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted (""I have no desire to die"") and involve ongoing distress and suppression. This fits the 'Indicator' definition: general distress with suicidal thoughts that are explicitly negated as unwanted, without a personal desire to die. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior', and no past action, ruling out 'Attempt'. Although phrases like ""fantasizing about my death"" could be misinterpreted, the explicit negation and lack of desire make this 'Indicator' rather than 'Ideation'. The thinking process emphasizes that explicitly unwanted thoughts should be classified as 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Explicitly states ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" indicating a personal desire to die. Expresses hopelessness (""I feel unimportant,"" ""no more options""), despair (""struggling more and more""), and perceived burdensomeness (""Others deserve care, unlike me"").  
   - Explicit suicide/death intent: **Yes** (""wish to end my life,"" ""end all this""). The phrase ""I just can't harm myself"" negates action but **does not negate the desire to die**; it reflects an inability to act, not an unwillingness.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: **No** mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines. The statement ""I can't harm myself"" explicitly rules out current actionable intent.  
   - Temporal context/action: **No** description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, preparations). Focus is on current thoughts and distress.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit and personal** (""wish to end my life""), meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is indicated. The inability to self-harm (""I just can't"") underscores a lack of actionable intent or means.  
   - **Distinction from Indicator**: While distress is present, the explicit desire to die moves this beyond abstract distress or unwanted thoughts. The author does not frame suicidal thoughts as unwanted (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts""); instead, they express a wish to die but feel unable to act.  
   - **Distinction from Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, or past/future actions.  
   - Conclusion: **Ideation** (desire to die with no plan/action).

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress (""lost control,"" ""want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream,"" ""help please"") and includes the phrase ""I don't want to live this again."" This indicates a desire to avoid reliving a painful experience but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. There are no references to plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The phrase ""live this again"" suggests an aversion to a recurring situation rather than a direct wish for life to end. The emotional tone is one of desperation and a plea for help, but without suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The expression ""I don't want to live this again"" does not convey a clear desire to die or for life to end; it focuses on avoiding a specific distressing experience. There are no suicidal thoughts described as unwanted or negated, as suicidal ideation isn't present. The language leans toward distress about a situation, not a personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The post lacks any indication of intended action, even if vague. Without explicit suicidal desire, this step doesn't apply, but even if considered, there's no evidence of behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current emotional distress (""I lost control"") and references not wanting to relive a past experience (""live this again""), but it does not describe any past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, preparations). The phrase ""this again"" implies a recurring issue but not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness without a personal expression of suicidal desire. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is ambiguous but, in context, emphasizes avoidance of pain rather than a wish to die. It lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. If suicidal desire were present, it would be 'Ideation,' but here it's absent. The plea for help (""help please"") and focus on emotional turmoil align with 'Indicator,' which covers distress without clear suicidal intent. There is no evidence for 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense distress (""It's too hard,"" ""this fucking sickness... horrible""), hopelessness (""I'm tired""), feeling misunderstood by family, and a past relationship's impact.  
   - Explicitly references preparing for suicide: **""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it.""**  
   - No explicit mention of death/suicide methods, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  
   - The phrase ""decided this is it"" implies a personal desire to end life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""I decided this is it"" expresses a clear desire for life to end in the context of despair. No negation of desire (e.g., unwanted thoughts) is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Leaving a suicide note is a documented **preparation** step for suicide. No specific method/timeline is mentioned, but preparation alone qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The note-leaving is a **past preparatory action**. There is no description of a *lethal action being initiated* (e.g., ingesting pills), so this is not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** (""this is it""), ruling out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Preparation (note) is confirmed**, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' (thoughts only).  
   - No *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I took pills"") → not 'Attempt'.  
   - **Preparation + intent → 'Behavior'.**

Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""screamed that I wanted to die"" (past), ""it's never been far away from my mind since"" (ongoing ideation), ""I just. Want. To die,"" ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"".
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""Nothing can be bothered with anymore""), self-loathing (""unstable freak,"" ""creep""), worthlessness (""I don't deserve anything""), burden (""I don't want to be a burden anymore""), and isolation (""I alienate everyone"").
   - Plan/Method/Preparation: Explicitly asks ""How do I kill myself..."" and considers logistics (""without leaving a body my parents have to deal with""), indicating active contemplation of methods.
   - Past actions: References past suicidal ideation (""screamed that I wanted to die"" in middle school) but **no description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal action**. Mentions being fired for ""being suicidal"" (ideation/behavior, not an attempt).
   - Imminence/Intent: Strong current desire (""I just. Want. To die"") coupled with a direct question about method execution (""How do I kill myself...""), implying active planning. No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I won't act"").
   - Desire assessment: Clear, personal wish to die (""I just. Want. To die"") with no indication thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die.""  
   - Clear desire to die: ""I just. Want. To die"" expresses unambiguous personal intent.  
   - No negation: No statements rejecting the desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"").  
   → **Yes, explicit intent.**

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Method mentioned: Asks ""How do I kill myself..."" and specifies a logistical concern (""without leaving a body""). This implies active consideration of methods (e.g., methods avoiding discovery) and practical planning.  
   - Preparation: Considering aftermath (""body my parents have to deal with"") indicates preparatory thinking.  
   - Context: Coupled with strong current intent (""I just. Want. To die"") and no mitigating language.  
   → **Plan/method/preparation indicated.**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Past: Describes historical ideation (""screamed I wanted to die"" in middle school) but **no initiated action** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted...""). Being fired for ""being suicidal"" refers to ideation/behavior, not an attempt.  
   - Current: Focuses on present desire (""I just. Want. To die"") and future-oriented planning (""How do I kill myself..."").  
   → **No past or recent self-initiated lethal action (Attempt not applicable).**

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** base) + method/preparation planning (""How do I kill myself..."" + logistical details) = **Behavior**.  
   - ""How do I kill myself..."" demonstrates intent to act and method consideration, moving beyond passive ideation.  
   - No past initiated lethal action (ruling out **Attempt**).  
   - No ambiguity: Desire is explicit and not unwanted (ruling out **Indicator**).  
   → **Behavior** is the best fit.

A lot of times I feel like I wasn't meant for this world. I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is. Everything here is lame and it just makes me sick and I don't really see a future for myself. In the end, I'm just going to keep disappointing those who care till everyone hates me. One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional despair: ""No point in it all,"" ""I hate being trapped,"" ""I don't see a future,"" ""My view of the world is growing dim.""  
   - Expresses desire for an end: ""I need something to really push me over the edge,"" ""One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all,"" ""eternal void.""  
   - Rejects passive waiting: ""No point in waiting for it to come naturally.""  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Strong implied desire to die (e.g., ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" rejecting natural death). Phrases like ""I'll be free"" and ""eternal void"" signal a personal wish for life to end.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: While ""push me over the edge"" suggests openness to acting, it’s vague and lacks specificity (method, tools, timeline, or preparations). No imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past/initiated self-harm actions. Focus is on current/future desire, not historical attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) is present, but no plan/method/preparation (ruling out Behavior).  
   - ""Push me over the edge"" implies contemplation but not concrete intent or method; vagueness leans toward Ideation.  
   - No past actions (ruling out Attempt).  
   - Strong desire (""hate living"" equivalent) without explicit negation makes Indicator inappropriate.  

**Conclusion**: Fits **Ideation** (clear desire to die, no actionable plan/method).

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post discusses suicide in a general, abstract context, explaining why ""people"" commit suicide due to bottling up emotions and eventually breaking down. It uses collective language like ""we"" and ""people,"" but this is not a personal expression of the author's own state. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm, or specific plans/preparations related to the author. Emotional indicators like distress are present but framed as a universal experience (e.g., ""bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down""), not as the author's current personal feelings. No timeframe, imminence, past actions, or desire to die is expressed by the author. The focus is on societal observation, not self-disclosure.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commit suicide""), but it is in a general, third-person context about others, not the author. There is no personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The author does not express or imply any current suicidal thoughts about themselves. Thus, there is no explicit personal suicidal intent from the author. The use of ""we"" is collective and observational, not indicative of the author's own desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, preparations, or intended actions are mentioned for the author. The post is entirely abstract and descriptive of others' experiences, with no implication of the author having a plan or considering self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a general pattern of behavior (""people get to that place"") without referencing any past, current, or future actions initiated by the author. No personal suicidal actions or attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post falls under 'Indicator' because it discusses suicide abstractly and expresses general distress about emotional struggles, but it lacks any clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire, intent, plan, or action from the author. The mention of suicidal thoughts is not personal and not framed as unwanted by the author—it is purely observational. There is no ambiguity suggesting personal ideation (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent), and no elements of behavior or attempt are present. The focus is on understanding suicide as a broader phenomenon, not on the author's own risk.

372,If I kill myself Im giving nobody nothing. fuck everyone  I knew. I dont owe anybody shit whether they wanted to help me or not. I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever and people will know I aint having any of their shit. I dont owe anybody anything and if they have a problem with that too bad because I'd  be dead.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever,"" indicating direct suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include anger (""fuck everyone,"" ""I dont owe anybody shit"") and a sense of finality (""before I leave this world forever,"" ""I'd be dead""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The language is conditional (""If I kill myself"") and future-oriented, with no reference to past actions. Imminence is not specified (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is explicit and not negated as unwanted; it is presented as a defiant act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""leave this world forever,"" ""I'd be dead""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is mentioned. The phrase ""leave a giant middle finger"" could imply a preparatory act like leaving a message, but it is vague and metaphorical, not concrete. With high intent but no imminence specified, this does not clearly indicate a plan or preparation. Thus, it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses a future or hypothetical intention (""If I kill myself,"" ""before I leave""), not a past or recent initiated action. There is no description of a past attempt (e.g., ""I tried to...""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and thoughts, placing it beyond 'Indicator'. However, the lack of a specific plan, method, preparation, or high imminence means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. The conditional language and vagueness about action lean toward 'Ideation'. No past action is described, so 'Attempt' is irrelevant. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses profound hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia (e.g., ""tired of having to live,"" ""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I hate it,"" ""I can't motivate myself,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead""). It includes a direct statement about death (""Dead"") in response to a future outlook, indicating a personal desire for life to end. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The emotional indicators are strong, but the death reference is predictive and not immediate (timeframe: five years). The writer's desire for death is implied but not explicitly negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" or similar phrases: No.
   - Clear desire to die or for life to end: Yes. Phrases like ""tired of having to live"" and ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" express a personal wish to not be alive, similar to ""I hate living"" in the guidelines, which implies ideation. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not representing a current personal desire (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned: No.
   - Signs of preparation: No.
   - With explicit desire to die, is there implied action? The death reference has low imminence (five years) and no vague action cues (e.g., ""do something""), so no plan or intended action is indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past events: Describes life failures (e.g., failing college, inability to maintain habits) but no initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"").
   - Current/future intentions: The ""Dead"" statement is a future prediction, not an immediate intention or plan to act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""tired of having to live,"" ""Dead""), fitting 'Ideation' as there is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts. No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The emotional distress alone, without unambiguous suicidal desire, would be 'Indicator', but the explicit expressions of wanting life to end elevate it to 'Ideation'. Ambiguity is low after analysis; the desire is personally expressed and not negated.

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain,"" which references suicide, but it is framed as a general, hypothetical question about why people intervene when someone else considers suicide. The author uses third-person language (""someone,"" ""their""), not first-person, indicating this is not a personal expression of their own feelings. There are no emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) tied to the author themselves. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timeframes are mentioned for the author. The author states this is a ""Question"" and is ""Asking for a personal reason,"" suggesting curiosity or distress about the topic, but not a personal suicidal desire. The trigger warning (TW) implies awareness of the sensitive nature but doesn't indicate personal crisis.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""kill their self"" is explicit but refers to ""someone"" else, not the author. The author does not express any personal desire to die, such as ""I want to die"" or similar. Instead, the post is inquisitive and abstract. Suicidal thoughts are discussed generally and not attributed to the author, so there is no need to assess if they are unwanted for the author. This lack of personal suicidal intent leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned for the author. The discussion is vague and hypothetical, focused on reasons for intervention rather than actionable plans. With no personal desire expressed, this step doesn't support 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' for the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post does not describe any past, current, or future actions initiated by the author. It is purely a question about others' behavior, with no reference to the author's own suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts or preparations). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post falls under 'Indicator' because it discusses suicide abstractly (why people stop others) without any clear, personal expression of the author's desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. Phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent, and the third-person framing shows the author is not endorsing or experiencing personal suicidal ideation. While the ""personal reason"" hint might suggest underlying distress, the post content itself lacks explicit suicidal intent from the author. If suicidal thoughts were present but unwanted, it could be 'Indicator', but here, no personal thoughts are expressed at all. There is no ambiguity suggesting 'Ideation' (personal desire) or higher categories.

I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""suicidal since I was about 10 or 11,"" ""thought jumping in and drowning"" (past ideation), ""suicide by a train is on my mind"" (current ideation with method), ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" (future plan), and ""put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"" (specific method inquiry).
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed,"" ""waking up everyday faking everything,"" and persistent suicidal thoughts (""every hour... suicide by a train is on my mind"") show hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans/methods: Current plan for ""suicide by a train"" on a specific date (18th birthday), with method details (""put neck on the train tracks"") and preparation (researching lethality).
   - References to past actions: At age 10-11, ""thought jumping in and drowning"" but was convinced not to—this is described as a thought, not an initiated action (e.g., no mention of entering water or actual attempt).
   - Imminence: Plan is future-dated (""on my 18th birthday""), not immediate, but intent is clear.
   - Stated desire: Expresses a genuine, current desire to die (e.g., persistent thoughts, planning), with no indication that thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train,"" and planning to act, indicating a clear personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes: Specific method (""train tracks,"" ""put neck on the train tracks"") and detailed plan (""on my 18th birthday"") are stated. Inquiry about instant lethality (""will it instantly kill me"") shows active preparation and consideration of the method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past event: ""thought jumping in and drowning"" at age 10-11 is described as ideation only (thought, not action), as it was not initiated (convinced not to). No other past actions are mentioned.
   - Current/future: Focuses on current suicidal thoughts with a future plan and method, not on past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Not 'Indicator': Explicit personal desire to die is present (e.g., ""suicidal,"" planning), and thoughts are not stated as unwanted.
   - Not 'Ideation': While suicidal thoughts are expressed, the post includes a specific plan (date), method (train tracks), and preparation (lethality inquiry), moving it beyond mere thoughts.
   - Not 'Attempt': The only past reference is to ideation (""thought jumping in""), not an initiated action. The current content describes future intent, not a past lethal action.
   - 'Behavior' applies: The author expresses suicidal desire with a plan, method, and preparation (researching method effectiveness), even though the act is planned for the future. Imminence is lower (dated), but the specificity of the plan and method solidifies this category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but clarifies they are mostly in the past.  
   - Expresses distress about *recurring* thoughts triggered by another person's suicide attempt (""I keep thinking about it"").  
   - Describes a shift in perception (suicide feeling more ""real"" and ""attainable"") but **explicitly states a lack of desire for these thoughts** (""I just don’t want to think like this anymore"").

   - No reference to past personal suicide attempts or self-initiated actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but **explicitly negated as unwanted**. The phrase ""I just don’t want to think like this anymore"" confirms the thoughts are distressing but not desired.

   - No indication of a plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations. The post focuses solely on intrusive thoughts, not action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions by the author. Only references others' actions and personal thoughts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is **distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts** (""I don’t want to think like this""), not a personal desire to die.  
   - Strong emotional indicators (e.g., feeling triggered) are present, but suicidal ideation is framed as intrusive and unwelcome.  
   - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: discusses suicidal thoughts abstractly/contextually while explicitly rejecting them as undesired.  
   - Rules out 'Ideation' due to the negation of desire and absence of expressions like ""I want to die.""  
   - No elements of 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes intrusive thoughts, compulsions, rage outbursts, and depressive episodes. The key phrase is ""just want my life to end,"" expressing a direct personal desire for life to cease. No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or references to past actions are mentioned.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. ""just want my life to end"" explicitly expresses a personal desire for life to end in a context of despair. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I don't want to"").
3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No. The post lacks any mention of methods, tools, locations, preparations, or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""planning to""). The focus is on thoughts and distress.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: No past or recent self-initiated potentially lethal actions (e.g., ""tried,"" ""attempted"") are described. The post discusses current mental states only.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit desire to end life (""just want my life to end"") qualifies as suicidal ideation. The absence of plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent rules out Behavior. No past actions indicate Attempt. The lack of explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't want to die"") distinguishes this from Indicator. Strong expressions like ""want my life to end"" without negation align with Ideation.

   - Yes: ""nearly killing myself"" confirms personal suicidal intent. ""Step off a building or over a bridge"" reinforces desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Methods mentioned (""building,"" ""bridge"") are future hypotheticals with no stated plan/preparation. No current tools, notes, or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Past event (""nearly killing myself"") implies an *initiated action*.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Past action: ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a self-initiated, potentially lethal act (interrupted or incomplete). This qualifies as an **Attempt**.
   - Future thoughts (""it'll only take one day..."") lack specificity/imminence for 'Behavior'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence because the author explicitly describes a past self-initiated suicidal action (""nearly killing myself""), regardless of when it occurred.  
   - Current expressions of despair and hypothetical future methods fall under secondary context but do not override the clear past **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""i want to take myself out"" (colloquial for suicide).
   - Emotional indicators: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""need a way out,"" ""i just need it to stop.""
   - Plan/method/preparation: ""take myself out"" is vague; no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. Fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") suggests consideration of methods but no concrete plan.
   - Past actions: None described.
   - Imminence: No timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") indicating urgency.
   - Desire: Explicit desire to end life (""i want to take myself out""), not framed as unwanted thoughts. Fear of pain indicates ambivalence but not negation of desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""take myself out"" is a direct suicidal phrase.
   - Yes, expressions like ""shits not worth it anymore"" and ""need a way out"" imply a desire to end life. Fear of pain does not negate the underlying desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation identified. ""Take myself out"" is too vague to imply a method without context, and no imminence reinforces vagueness.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Focuses on current feelings/future intention (""i want to...""). No past actions described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""take myself out"") rules out *Indicator*.
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, or high imminence rules out *Behavior*.
   - No past initiated action rules out *Attempt*.
   - Strong suicidal intent without actionable steps fits *Ideation*.

380,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""the more I live the more I want to die,"" which explicitly mentions a desire to die. ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore"" indicates emotional distress, such as hopelessness and anhedonia (loss of interest in activities).
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: Yes, ""want to die"" is a direct reference to death.
   - Emotional indicators: Present, including hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, preparations: None mentioned. No tools, locations, substances, or actions (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - References to past actions: None; the post is in present tense, focusing on current feelings.
   - Imminence: No indication of timing (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the statement is general.
   - Stated desire: ""I want to die"" expresses a genuine personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention: ""Want to die"" is a clear expression of death intent, though not using the word ""suicide"" directly. It aligns with phrases like ""I wish I wasn't here"" or ""I want life to end.""
   - Desire to die: Yes, the phrase conveys a current, personal wish to not be alive.
   - Unwanted thoughts: No, there is no explicit negation (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, goodbyes) or intended action.
   - Despite the strong desire to die, there is no vague or explicit reference to a plan, method, or imminent action. Thus, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""the more I live,"" ""want to die"") with no reference to past or future actions.
   - No description of a specific, self-initiated past action (e.g., an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to die""), which qualifies as suicidal ideation under the definition. Phrases like this are explicitly categorized under 'Ideation' (e.g., similar to ""I hate living"").
   - No plan, method, preparation, or intended action is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past initiated action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The desire is not framed as unwanted or distressing without personal intent (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so it does not fit 'Indicator'. Even if ambiguous, the explicit ""want to die"" strongly implies personal desire, making 'Ideation' appropriate.
   - Conclusion: The post fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without any plan or action elements.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""contemplating"" (in context of suicide), ""thinking on how to die painlessly,"" ""I want to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm a burnout,"" ""useless,"" ""failure""), feeling like a burden (""less children to feed, less bills to pay"").  
   - Plan/method: Vague reference to seeking a ""painless"" method but explicitly states ""I have yet to find a way."" No specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Past actions: None described (only *thoughts* over ""6+ months"").  
   - Imminence: No timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""I want to die"" but fears ""consequences of failure,"" indicating ambivalence but no negation of the desire itself.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""contemplating [suicide implied],"" ""thinking on how to die,"" ""I want to die.""  
   - Desire is **not** explicitly unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act""). Fear of failure ≠ rejection of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method identified (""have yet to find a way"").  
   - No preparations described (e.g., no note, means acquisition).  
   - Vague ideation about ""painless"" methods without actionable detail.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing suicidal ideation (""6+ months"") but **no past or recent self-initiated lethal actions**. ""Tried to tell them"" refers to communication, not a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die (""I want to die"") without negation.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan, method, or preparation mentioned despite prolonged ideation.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/current initiated suicidal actions.  
   - **Ideation**: Clear desire to die and prolonged suicidal thoughts, but absence of plan/method/preparation. Fear of failure shows ambivalence but doesn’t negate ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts (""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years pretty much nonstop"") and references to suicide in general (""So many people commit suicide""). There are strong emotional indicators of despair, hopelessness, and hatred (e.g., ""I hate everything and everyone,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit,"" ""My life is ruined""). Specific preparation is indicated with ""I hate how I have emails to send to my parents before I do it,"" implying that sending emails is a step prior to a suicidal act. There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or location, and no description of past initiated actions (e.g., no reference to a prior suicide attempt). The temporal context focuses on ongoing thoughts and future intentions (""before I do it""), with imminence implied but not specified (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with frustration about fear preventing action (""Why must I be so afraid?"") and no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and discusses suicide directly. It expresses a clear personal desire to die through phrases like ""I hate everything,"" ""I'm very OVER this shit,"" and the constant suicidal thoughts over five years. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the writer laments their fear of acting, indicating a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is not mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations described). However, there is explicit preparation: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" indicates a concrete step (sending emails) intended prior to the suicidal act. This, combined with the high intent and despair expressed, suggests an intended action. The phrase ""before I do it"" implies a plan, even if vague, and the writer's fear of ""wuss[ing] out"" reinforces the contemplation of imminent action. Therefore, this points toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing suicidal thoughts for five years but no past or recent initiated actions. The reference to sending emails is preparatory and future-oriented. There is no description of a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal past action (e.g., no mention of an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'. While there is no specific method, the mention of preparation (sending emails) coupled with high intent and imminence (""before I do it"") elevates it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action is described. The ambiguity in method is outweighed by the clear preparation and intent, supporting 'Behavior'.

I ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail and I'm taking it all as soon as it gets here",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""Ending it soon"") and a specific method (taking 14 grams of dextromethorphan). Emotional indicators are present, such as depression, fear about the virus affecting the author's mother, distress from living in an anti-LGBT environment, job loss, and a reference to a ""really bad trip"" causing lasting harm. The author describes preparations (""ordered 14 grams of dextromethorphan in the mail"") and a clear intention to act imminently (""taking it all as soon as it gets here""). There is no mention of past suicidal actions; the focus is on future intent. Imminence is high due to ""soon"" and ""as soon as it gets here."" The desire to die is expressed directly through ""Ending it soon"" without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide through the phrase ""Ending it soon,"" which is a direct euphemism for suicide. It also expresses a clear desire to die or for life to end, as evidenced by the context and the plan to overdose. There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted), so this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: overdosing on dextromethorphan (a substance that can be lethal in high doses). Preparations are explicitly described, including ordering the substance and the intention to consume it all upon arrival. The high imminence (""soon"" and ""as soon as it gets here"") reinforces that this is an intended action. This clearly points to 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""Ending it soon,"" ""taking it all as soon as it gets here"") with no references to past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt). The ordering of the substance is preparation, not an initiated lethal action, so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (""Ending it soon"") and includes a specific method (dextromethorphan overdose) and preparations (ordering and planning to take it), with high imminence. This meets the criteria for 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' due to the clear suicidal intent without negation, not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan and preparations, and not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses existential despair and hopelessness about the length of human life. Key elements include:
   - Rhetorical questioning of life's value (""how people can want to live?"", ""how they actually find important to stay alive?"").
   - Calculation of remaining lifespan (""60 fucking years left"") framed as burdensome.
   - Negative evaluation of past life (""it wasn't really good"") and dread about the future (""I have to live 60 years more"").
   - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.
   - Emotional tone: Hopelessness, frustration, and disillusionment with existence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.
   - **No clear personal desire to die** expressed (e.g., ""I want to die""). The focus is on questioning life's purpose/value generally, not stating a wish for personal death. Phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent.
   - The distress is existential (""Living so much"" is framed as illogical/unpleasant), not a stated wish to end life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **None present**. No references to plans, methods, tools, locations, preparations, or intended actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Focuses on philosophical dissatisfaction with life duration and past/present quality of life.
   - **No description** of past self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) or recent preparatory behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows **general distress and hopelessness** but lacks personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions.
   - Philosophical questioning of life's value (""how people can want to live?"") without personal ownership of suicidal intent aligns with **Indicator**.
   - Absence of phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I can't live"" distinguishes it from **Ideation**.
   - No evidence for **Behavior** (no plan/method) or **Attempt** (no past action).

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses ""passive suicidal"" individuals and the concept of ""suicide by cop"" in a general, hypothetical context. It is a commentary on how threatening to call the police might influence others, not a personal expression from the author.
   - There are no mentions of the author's own death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means for themselves.
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) are expressed by the author; the tone is advisory and critical of others' actions.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the author are present.
   - No imminence of intention is indicated, as the content is abstract and not self-referential.
   - The author does not express any personal desire to die or for life to end; instead, they focus on external scenarios.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" but only in reference to others, not the author. No direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or personal expressions of desire to die are present.
   - The author does not express a clear personal desire to die or for life to end. Suicidal thoughts are discussed abstractly and attributed to hypothetical others, not the author.
   - Since there are no personal suicidal thoughts expressed (wanted or unwanted), this step does not indicate ideation but leans toward 'Indicator' due to the abstract discussion.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - ""Suicide by cop"" is mentioned as a method, but it is not attributed to the author; it is a general risk described for others.
   - No signs of personal preparation, plans, or intended actions by the author are evident.
   - Without personal desire or intent from the author, this step does not support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario involving others, not a past or recent event involving the author.
   - No description of any past self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author is present. The content is entirely external and advisory.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly (e.g., risks for ""passive suicidal"" individuals) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, intent, plan, or action from the author.
   - It fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes abstract discussions of suicide without clear, current, personal suicidal intent from the author. Phrases like ""passive suicidal"" are general and not self-applied.
   - There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (personal plan/method), or 'Attempt' (past personal action), as the content is focused on others and lacks self-referential risk factors.
   - Following the rules, the risk corresponds only to the author, who shows no personal indicators beyond abstract commentary.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""the way I choose to go"" (referring to suicide via insulin pump), ""do it"" (suicidal act), ""ideas for how to do it.""
   - Emotional indicators: Depression (""pretty sure I've been depressed""), feeling like a burden (""hate being a burden"").
   - Specific plan/method: Explicitly identifies using an insulin pump (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"") as the intended method. Notes accessibility (""easiest and most accessible"").
   - Preparations: References acquiring means (potential future access to pump if condition worsens).
   - Past actions: ""Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't"" – indicates ideation/contemplation, not initiated action.
   - Imminence: Conditional on diagnosis worsening (""if it gets bad""). No immediate timeframe stated.
   - Desire: ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" expresses personal desire to use this method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes. ""the way I choose to go"" directly implies choosing suicide as an exit. ""Do it"" and ""go"" are contextual synonyms for suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes. A specific, highly lethal method (insulin overdose via pump) is identified as the preferred option (""might be the way I choose to go""). The author links acquiring the pump (a preparation) to facilitating this method (""most accessible""). Having ""ideas for how to do it"" reinforces planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes future intention/contingent plan (using pump if condition worsens) and past thoughts (""thought about doing it""). 
   - No description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action. ""Thought about"" and ""didn't"" confirm no action was taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Clear personal desire to die (Ideation base) is present.
   - A specific, lethal method (insulin overdose via pump) and preparation (acquiring the pump) are explicitly mentioned, moving it beyond Ideation.
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action is described (""thought about"" ≠ action), ruling out Attempt.
   - The presence of a plan/method/preparation (even if contingent on future events) meets the criteria for Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill yourself"" explicitly, which is a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nobody told me happy birthday,"" ""they just walked past me like I was nothing,"" ""I'm just tired of everything,"" ""Worst birthday ever!""). There is a specific temporal context of high imminence (""right now"") with the phrase ""I have a chance right now,"" but no specific method, plan, or preparation is described (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note). The desire to die is personal and current (""well I do""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" in a personal context (""well I do"") and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., wanting to kill oneself on their birthday). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" implies opportunity and high imminence but is vague and does not describe an intended action, method, or plan. With explicit desire and imminence, this could lean toward Behavior, but the lack of any concrete detail about how or what action would be taken makes it ambiguous. After careful consideration, this remains too vague to constitute a plan, method, or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""right now"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no references to previous attempts or self-harm events). The focus is on present ideation and opportunity, not on a historical or recent attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die, placing it beyond Indicator (which requires no clear desire or unwanted thoughts). There is no plan, method, or preparation specified, so it does not meet the threshold for Behavior. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" indicates high imminence and intent, but due to vagueness and lack of actionable detail (e.g., no method implied), it is best classified as Ideation. No past action is described, so Attempt does not apply. Therefore, the category is Ideation.

Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me.

   - Mentions of suicide: Explicitly states ""I'm finally considering suicide"" and discusses death (""We all die right?""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore""), isolation, academic despair, feeling ""pathetic,"" and loss of coping mechanisms. 
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific method, tools, location, or preparatory actions described. 
   - Temporal context/action: Refers to *current* suicidal consideration (""finally considering suicide"") but no description of past or imminent self-initiated lethal actions. 
   - Desire: Expresses genuine suicidal ideation (""considering suicide"") without explicit negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to act on it""). Mentions parents as a deterrent, but this does not negate the personal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicit mention: Yes (""considering suicide""). 
   - Desire to die: Implied through ""considering suicide"" and nihilistic framing (""We all die right? So why should I give a shit""). 
   - Unwanted thoughts? No explicit rejection of thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t actually want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No method, plan, tools, preparations, or imminent timeline mentioned. Only abstract consideration. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - No past or recent self-initiated potentially lethal actions described (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or ""took pills""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit personal desire to die (""considering suicide"") → Rules out *Indicator*. 
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out *Behavior*. 
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions → Rules out *Attempt*. 
   - Strong suicidal ideation present without qualifying elements for other categories → **Ideation**.

Living life as a shell is bullshit but I cant even kill myself. I dont know if this is divine intervention or some shit but it hit me to the core. I was ready. I almost committed. What am I doing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions a recent suicide attempt (""I just attempted to end my life"") and describes physical actions: self-inflicted injuries (""wrists and thighs are bleeding""), holding a knife, intense emotional distress (""shaking and bawling""), and being on the verge of acting (""right there about to do"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Living life as a shell"") and self-loathing (""too much of a pussy"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Use of a knife to cut wrists/thighs.  
   - Temporal context: ""Just attempted"" indicates a very recent self-initiated action.  
   - Desire to die is explicit (""ready to leave everything,"" ""almost committed"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** Phrases like ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""almost committed"" confirm a clear personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes.** A specific method (knife, cutting wrists/thighs) and physical preparation (bleeding, holding the knife) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""just attempted,"" bleeding wounds, putting the knife down after initiating).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The author describes a concrete, self-initiated suicidal action (cutting with a knife) that was interrupted. This fits the **'Attempt'** definition: a recent, potentially lethal act, regardless of outcome.  
   - Current distress and suicidal thoughts are present, but the core of the post centers on the **past action** (""just attempted""), which takes precedence.  
   - Rules: Historical attempts qualify if described by the author; here, it is recent and directly linked to their current state.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would"" (direct suicidal intent), ""when I do [talk to parents] I feel like killing myself"" (suicidal ideation linked to specific trigger).
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it""), worthlessness (""people hurt me too much""), isolation (""dying alone""), and burden (""walk on eggshells"").
   - No specific plans/methods: References suicide abstractly (""kill myself"") but no tools, locations, timelines, or preparations.
   - Past actions: Explicitly denies attempts (""I've never actually attempted suicide"").
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight""); focuses on hypothetical inability to act (""I don't have the guts"").
   - Desire: Clear wish to die is expressed (""I would [kill myself] if I had the guts""), with no explicit negation of this desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" (twice). Strong desire is evident (""I would [kill myself] if I had the guts""), and no statements frame thoughts as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - No: Mentions suicidal desire but no method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""tonight I will...""), preparations (e.g., buying tools), or vague actionable intent with imminence. The barrier (""guts"") implies contemplation without actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Past: Denies any prior attempts (""never actually attempted"").
   - Present/Future: Desires death but frames it as currently unattainable due to fear/lack of courage. No description of initiated actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die exists (""kill myself"") without being framed as unwanted distress.
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation (vague ""guts"" barrier ≠ actionable plan).
   - **Not Attempt**: Author explicitly denies past attempts.
   - **Ideation confirmed**: Clear expressions of suicidal desire (""kill myself"") and persistent ideation (e.g., triggered by parents), but no actionable plan, method, or preparation.

My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left. And my parents, mostly mom, are pure evil when it comes to school and mental health. Killing myself is the only escape.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions of suicide: ""ending my life tonight,"" ""killing myself is the only escape.""
    - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What's the point...""), feeling trapped (""only escape""), self-loathing (""coward"").
    - Specific plan/method: ""slit my wrists with some scissors"" (method), ""tonight"" (imminence), ""when everyone is going to bed"" (timing).
    - Preparation: ""written my suicide note and put it on my notes app,"" ""delete everything.""
    - Stated desire: Explicit wish to die (""ending my life,"" ""killing myself is the only escape"") with no negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes. Direct phrases: ""ending my life tonight,"" ""killing myself."" 
    - Yes. Clear desire: ""only escape,"" ""goodbye everyone."" 
    - No indication of unwanted thoughts; desire is affirmed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Specific method: ""slit my wrists with some scissors."" 
    - Preparation: Suicide note written, plans to ""delete everything."" 
    - High imminence: ""tonight,"" specific timing (""when everyone is going to bed"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes future intention (""tonight""). 
    - No past initiated actions described (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + specific method (scissors) + preparation (note) + imminent timing = **Behavior**. 
    - No past initiated action (rules out Attempt). 
    - Plan/method is explicit (rules out Ideation). 
    - Desire is personal and active (rules out Indicator).

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" indicating a personal suicidal plan. It references the plan being disclosed to family, leading to monitoring (""they're keeping their heads up and watching me""). Emotional indicators include frustration and anger (""what the fuck"") and a comparison to euthanasia prevention, implying a desire for death. There is no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparation details, but the word ""plan"" implies an intended action. The timeframe is past for the plan disclosure, but the current monitoring suggests ongoing risk. The author expresses a genuine desire for death through the euthanasia analogy, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent. The euthanasia comparison (""preventing someone to get euthanized"") strongly implies a personal desire to die, not just distress. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to""), so the desire appears genuine.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A plan is explicitly mentioned (""my plan to kill myself""), though no specific method or preparation details are provided. The context of the plan being serious enough to warrant intervention (family monitoring) supports the existence of an intended action. Coupled with the explicit desire to die, this meets the criteria for 'Behavior' (mention of a plan, even if vague).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past plan (""snitched on me and told family my plan"") that was disrupted, leading to current prevention. There is no description of a specific, initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""); it focuses on the plan and its aftermath. Thus, it does not describe an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit suicidal intent and a stated plan, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire) or 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan). The mention of a plan aligns with 'Behavior', as it indicates an intended action, even without method details. There is no past initiated action for 'Attempt'. The frustration about prevention suggests ongoing risk, but the core content is the disclosed plan.
   - Final category: Behavior.

393,Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""im gonna kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. It includes a specific timeframe (""3 weeks from now"") and preparatory behavior (isolating from everyone except children for 3 weeks). Emotional indicators include isolation and concern for the baby's safety, but the core focus is on the planned suicide. There is no mention of a past action or attempt; the content is future-oriented.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself,"" showing an explicit personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the language conveys intent (""im gonna"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, the post includes a clear plan with a timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and preparatory actions (minimizing interactions and not fostering conversations, which could indicate behavioral preparation like distancing or saying goodbye). The combination of explicit intent, specific timeframe, and preparatory behavior implies an intended action, aligning with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""im gonna kill myself"" in 3 weeks), not a past or recent initiated action. There is no reference to a historical attempt (e.g., ""I tried before""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content goes beyond 'Indicator' (no unwanted thoughts or ambiguity; desire is explicit) and 'Ideation' (there is a plan and preparation, not just thoughts). It fits 'Behavior' because of the stated intent, specific timeline (plan), and preparatory isolation. 'Attempt' is ruled out as no past action is described. Despite the method being vague, the high intent and imminence (specific near-future date) support 'Behavior'.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post lists specific substances and quantities (Midol 3 bottles, Prozac 30 pills of 20mg each, Tylenol bottle, water bottle full of alcohol) and asks ""Would this kill me?"" This directly references death/dying and implies a potential method for suicide via overdose. There are no emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) mentioned, but the focus is on the lethality of the combination. No past actions are described; the post is prospective, asking about a future outcome. Imminence is implied by the detailed inventory, suggesting immediate consideration. The stated desire is ambiguous—it questions death but does not explicitly express a wish to die or not to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" It questions death (""Would this kill me?"") but does not clearly state a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly negated as unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to""). The context implies suicidal intent through the method-focused question, but the lack of explicit desire expression means this step alone leans more toward ambiguity than clear ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is clearly mentioned: overdose via a combination of medications (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol) and alcohol, with precise quantities indicating detailed planning. The listing of items suggests preparation (e.g., possession or acquisition of means). Given the context—questioning lethality with this method—it implies intended action, especially with high imminence (the detail suggests readiness to act). Even without explicit desire, the method and preparation point strongly toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a potential future action, not a past event. There is no mention of any initiated action (e.g., ""I took these"" or ""I tried""). The focus is on planning and inquiry about outcomes.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post does not fit 'Indicator' because, while suicidal desire is not explicit, the method-specific question and preparation go beyond general distress or abstract discussion; there is no indication of unwanted thoughts. It does not fit 'Ideation' because the detailed method and preparation elements are present, moving it beyond mere desire/thoughts. It does not fit 'Attempt' as no past or recent initiated action is described. Instead, the combination of a clear method (overdose with listed substances), implied preparation (quantities suggesting possession), and the question about lethality (implying intended action with high imminence) aligns with 'Behavior'. Ambiguity in desire is outweighed by the concrete plan and context.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""planning to end it,"" and describes a method (""car accident"") to disguise suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators include guilt about impacting loved ones and a strong desire to die (""get what I want"").
   - Specific plans/methods are mentioned: ""doing it in a way that doesn't look like suicide"" and ""car accident or something.""
   - No past actions are described; focus is on future intent.
   - Imminence is implied via ""recently I've been thinking"" but not explicitly stated (e.g., ""tonight""). 
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""get what I want"") but is conflicted about consequences for others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""suicide,"" ""planning to end it,"" and ""get what I want"" (i.e., death) are explicit. 
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""car accident"") and intent to disguise suicide are stated. The phrase ""planning to end it"" coupled with method details confirms planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes **future intention** (""planning,"" ""thinking of doing it""). No past actions initiated by the author are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die and method/plan are present → **Behavior**. 
   - ""Planning to end it"" + method (""car accident"") meets Behavior criteria. 
   - No past initiated action (ruling out Attempt). 
   - Not Indicator (desire is explicit) or Ideation (plan/method exists).

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I'm a complete lost cause,"" ""nothing I do can change it""), despair (""constantly stuck,"" ""always going to fail""), and feelings of being a burden (""constant burden on my sister,"" ""making my family more resentful""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - No references to past suicidal actions (e.g., the word ""attempts"" refers to life-improvement efforts like job applications, not self-harm). 
   - No indications of plans, preparations, or imminence related to suicide. 
   - The core sentiment is distress about failure and worthlessness, with no expression of a desire to die or for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die"" are absent; instead, the focus is on personal failure and burden). 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, there is no discussion of them being unwanted. 
   - The absence of explicit suicidal intent and the focus on distress support leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) for suicide. 
   - No vague references to action that could imply imminent behavior in context. 
   - Without explicit desire to die (from Step 2), this step does not apply, reinforcing 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes ongoing feelings and past life failures (e.g., job rejections, driving lessons), but no description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions. The term ""attempts"" clearly refers to efforts to improve life circumstances, not suicide. 
   - No basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and burden, but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. 
   - Phrases like ""lost cause"" indicate despair but, without suicidal intent (e.g., not equivalent to ""I hate living"" which would be 'Ideation'), this fits 'Indicator'. 
   - No ambiguity about suicidal desire: the content is solely about life struggles, not death or suicide. 
   - Ruled out 'Ideation' (no desire to die expressed), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), and 'Attempt' (no past suicidal action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of sadness, depression, loneliness, and a need for social connection (""I feel like shit,"" ""need to vent,"" ""feel a little less alone and depressed,"" ""I'm just fucking sad""). 
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (implied by ""depressed"" and needing to ""pretend that I have a friend"") but no explicit expressions of being a burden, hating life, or anhedonia. 
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. 
   - No imminence of any harmful intentions; the focus is on seeking immediate emotional support through conversation. 
   - The writer's stated desire is to alleviate distress and loneliness, not to die or end life. There is no expression of suicidal thoughts or desire for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No expression of a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, the question of them being unwanted does not apply. 
   - Conclusion: No explicit or implied suicidal intent; the content reflects general distress. Leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of any method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide or self-harm. 
   - No signs of intended action, even vague ones. The only action mentioned is seeking conversation (""talk on the phone"" or ""Discord voice call""). 
   - As there is no suicidal desire from step 2, this step reinforces that 'Behavior' is not indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings (""right now"") with no references to past events or future intentions involving suicide. 
   - No description of any past initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mentions of attempts, overdoses, or self-harm).

   - The post shows general distress (depression, sadness, loneliness) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions. 
   - This fits 'Indicator' because: 
     - There is no explicit or implied desire to die, and phrases like ""I feel like shit"" or ""depressed"" convey distress without crossing into suicidal ideation. 
     - No suicidal thoughts are present, so there is no ambiguity to resolve; if thoughts were mentioned but unwanted, it would still be 'Indicator', but here they are absent. 
     - Ruled out 'Ideation' due to no desire for death (e.g., ""I hate living"" is not present). 
     - Ruled out 'Behavior' due to no plan/method/action. 
     - Ruled out 'Attempt' due to no description of past self-initiated lethal actions.

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: 
     - Mentions writing a suicide note (""I wrote a note today"").
     - Expresses hopelessness (""light has disappeared,"" ""end of my rope,"" ""can't keep going like this"").
     - References severe distress (failed treatments, isolation, feeling worthless).
     - States fear of death no longer deters them.
     - No explicit mention of death/suicide methods, timelines, or past actions beyond seeking help.
     - Desire for life to end is strongly implied but not explicitly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Strong implied desire to end suffering (e.g., ""can't keep going,"" ""last chance at asking for help""), but no direct expression of wanting death. Fear of death being insufficient as a deterrent suggests serious risk but falls short of explicit intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Clear preparation: Writing a suicide note (""I wrote a note today"") is a direct preparatory act.
   - No specific method, tools, location, or timeline mentioned, but the note alone indicates behavioral intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes a recent preparatory action (writing the note).
   - No mention of past or current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). The ER visit was for seeking help, not a suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong hopelessness and implied desire to end life lean toward Ideation, but the explicit note preparation overrides this.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The suicide note is a concrete preparatory behavior. Even without a stated method or timeline, this fulfills the ""Behavior"" criteria (preparations being taken).
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated lethal action occurred—only preparation. Thus, not an Attempt.
   - **Conclusion**: The suicide note confirms active planning/preparation, placing this in ""Behavior."" The lack of explicit death-desire phrasing is mitigated by the tangible preparatory act in the context of profound hopelessness.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""end my life"" directly, which is an explicit reference to suicide.
   - It describes past actions: ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again"" indicate that the author initiated a self-harm action intended to be lethal, but it was unsuccessful.
   - There is no specific method or plan detailed (e.g., pills, jumping), but the key element is the description of an initiated action (""tried"").
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness) or current desires are expressed; the focus is on the outcome of past actions.
   - The timeframe is past tense (""tried""), with no indication of imminence for future actions.
   - The author does not state that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, the language confirms an attempt was made.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" which conveys a clear desire to die at the time of the attempt.
   - There is no negation of the desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""), so it is not an expression of unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tools, or preparations are mentioned. However, the post describes an initiated action (""tried""), which shifts the focus to past behavior rather than current planning.
   - Since the content is about a past action, not current plans, it does not fit 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: the author states they ""tried to end my life again"" and that it ""didn't work."" This confirms a self-initiated, potentially lethal action was taken but failed.
   - The use of ""again"" implies recurrence, but the core is the description of a concrete past attempt.
   - According to the rules, a past suicide attempt (even if historical) qualifies as 'Attempt' when the author describes it in the context of their experience, as here.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit personal expression of suicidal action, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond thoughts/desires to describe an initiated action (""tried"").
   - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of current plans, methods, or preparations for future action; the focus is on a completed past event.
   - 'Attempt' fits best because the content clearly describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author, regardless of when it occurred or if it failed. The rules state that 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past action is described.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes a lengthy medical history following a back injury, detailing persistent symptoms, multiple consultations with various healthcare providers, unsuccessful treatments, and ongoing physical discomfort.

   - **No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.**  
   - **No references to suicidal thoughts, plans, preparations, or past actions.**

   - Expressions of hopelessness (""I feel hopeless"") are tied to the medical situation, **not** a desire to end life.  
   - **No discussion of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No implied or explicit references to plans, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

   - The post expresses **general distress and hopelessness** due to chronic physical symptoms and ineffective treatments.  
   - **No personal desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or past attempt is expressed.**  
   - Hopelessness alone, without suicidal intent or references, falls under **Indicator**.  
   - Phrases like ""I feel hopeless"" reflect distress about quality of life, not a wish for death.  
   - **No ambiguity**: The absence of suicidal content rules out Ideation/Behavior/Attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains strong expressions of self-loathing (""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat""), hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), and feelings of being a burden.  
   - Explicit violent imagery of death methods (""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my fucking throat"") is present but framed as a *deserved punishment* or *wish for external action*, not self-initiated plans.  
   - The author explicitly states: ""I have no plans and I don't think I'd succeed anyway,"" negating current intent or preparation.  
   - No past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I deserve to die,"" ""deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" and ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat."" These express a clear desire for death.  
   - **Crucially**, the desire is not negated as unwanted; instead, it is reinforced through self-condemnation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are mentioned (""bullet,"" ""slit my throat"") but **only in the context of what the author *deserves* or *wishes others would do* to them**.  
   - The author explicitly states having ""no plans"" and doubts their capability to succeed, indicating **no personal plan, preparation, or intended self-action**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. All content reflects current thoughts/desires.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong personal desire to die (e.g., ""I deserve to die"") confirms **Ideation** over **Indicator**.  
   - No evidence of a plan, method for self-action, or preparation (author denies plans), ruling out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current initiated suicidal actions, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - Violent imagery is metaphorical/descriptive of despair, not indicative of actionable intent by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/dying: ""I will die alone,"" ""so am I"" (implying death after parents are gone).  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I'm only alive by obligation,"" ""emptiness""), self-loathing (""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard""), worthlessness (""who wants to be with a sad man?""), anhedonia (""it's all I want... but it's gone"").  
   - Specific plans: Explicit conditional plan tied to parents' death (""the second they're gone, so am I"").  
   - Imminence: Not immediate (contingent on parents' death), but intent is clear.  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly states obligation is the *only* reason for living, with clear intent to die once that obligation ends.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""so am I"" (following ""they're gone"") strongly implies death by suicide in context.  
   - Clear desire to die: ""I'm only alive by obligation"" + ""so am I"" expresses a genuine wish for life to end once parents are deceased.  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts; instead, resignation to future action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific plan: Conditional on parents' death (""the second they're gone, so am I"").  
   - No method (e.g., pills, gun) mentioned, but the plan is explicit and time-bound (after parents die).  
   - High intent/imminence within the conditional framework.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intention (""the second they're gone, so am I"").  
   - No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts) described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die (conditional but genuine), not abstract distress.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No past/ongoing self-initiated lethal actions described.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Strong desire to die (Ideation) + conditional plan tied to a future event (parents' death) constitutes intended action. Though no method is specified, the structured contingency (""second they're gone"") implies preparation and commitment, fitting **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal ones"" (urges) explicitly, along with self-destructive urges.  
   - Expresses persistent thoughts about potential final interactions (""this might be our last conversation"").  
   - References guilt about suicidal thoughts due to impact on friends/sibling.  
   - **Key statement**: ""I have a plan but no date set kind of bad.""  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No past initiated actions (e.g., attempts) mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" urges and ""thinking of killing myself.""  
   - Desire is personal and current (""tonight,"" ""these days""). Guilt shows ambivalence but doesn’t negate the desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan explicitly stated**: ""I have a plan but no date set.""  
   - No method/preparation details, but the presence of *any* plan qualifies.

   - **No past initiated actions** described (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + explicit plan (""I have a plan"") = **Behavior**.  
   - ""No date set"" doesn’t negate planning; it confirms planning exists without fixed timing.  
   - Guilt and ambivalence are present but don’t override active suicidal planning.  
   - No past actions, so not 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly but frames them as something the author lies about to avoid therapeutic consequences (""lying about the suicidal thoughts""). 
   - Expresses distress about the *process* of disclosing thoughts (fear of causing ""a massive issue,"" stress, invasive questioning) and general struggle (""therapy tough enough,"" ""grave I dug myself""). 
   - No references to death/dying, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The ""grave"" metaphor implies hopelessness but not a literal desire to die. 
   - Key sentiment: Suicidal thoughts are presented as *unwanted obstacles* to therapy, not expressions of active desire. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but **negates personal desire to act or engage** (""lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff""). Phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die"" are absent. The focus is on distress about *having* thoughts and the burden of disclosure, not a wish to die. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - None. No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The post discusses concealment, not action. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No description of past or imminent actions. Only references increasing frequency of thoughts (""happen more and more frequently"") as a future concern, not an intent to act. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed as *unwanted* and concealed to avoid therapeutic intervention. The core sentiment is distress about the *existence* of thoughts and fear of consequences, **not a personal desire to die**. Metaphorical hopelessness (""grave I dug myself"") lacks explicit suicidal intent. 
   - Fits **Indicator**: Explicitly unwanted suicidal thoughts with no plan/action, coupled with general distress about life struggles.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""nearly killing myself"" and ""shooting up the school"" in the context of past bullying, indicating a historical suicidal crisis. It includes strong emotional distress like ""feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" and expressions of hopelessness (""why do the bullies always get away with it?""). There is no mention of a current plan, method, preparation, or imminent action. The phrase ""I fucking hate living"" is a direct expression of current despair and desire for life to end, but it is not paired with any actionable intent or details. The references to past events (""nearly killing myself"") are not described as initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took steps to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" (in a past context) and expresses a clear current desire to not be alive through ""I fucking hate living,"" which implies a personal wish for life to end. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""shooting up the school"" is tied to past bullying and is not presented as a current consideration or intention. There is no evidence of imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") or any preparatory steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past suicidal ideation (""nearly killing myself"") but does not describe a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""I tried to..."" or ""I attempted...""). Instead, ""nearly"" suggests proximity to action without confirmation of initiation, so it does not meet the threshold for 'Attempt'. The primary focus is on current feelings (""I'm stuck here feeling..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire for life to end (""I fucking hate living""), which qualifies for 'Ideation'. It lacks any current plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The historical reference to being ""bullied into nearly killing myself"" is not a described past action (e.g., it is not framed as an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply. While there is distress, the strong personal desire to not be alive means it is not 'Indicator' (which would require explicitly unwanted thoughts or absence of suicidal intent). Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly describes a past overdose (OD) involving swallowing 120+ ibuprofen pills and drinking hard liquor, which is a specific method for self-harm. It references survival from this event, indicating it was a potentially lethal action. Emotional indicators include feelings of stupidity, confusion (""why do I feel like that""), and current distress (""still processing everything,"" ""thoughts just pop up""). The author states a clear desire to die during the event (""I wanted to"") and resisted seeking help (""held off going to the hospital""). There is no mention of current plans, methods, or preparations for future actions; the focus is on processing the past event and its aftermath.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die in the context of the past event (""I wanted to""). While suicidal thoughts are mentioned as popping up currently, they are not explicitly stated as unwanted or negated in a way that shifts to 'Indicator'. The phrase ""I wanted to"" confirms genuine suicidal intent during the overdose.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is described for the past event (overdosing on ibuprofen and alcohol), but there is no indication of a current plan, method, or preparation for future actions. The current content involves reflection and distress about the past attempt, not imminent or future behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post primarily describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: the author swallowed pills and drank alcohol with the intent to die, which constitutes a suicide attempt. This is framed as a historical event (e.g., ""Survived OD,"" ""when I sat there""), but it is mentioned in the context of current processing and feelings. The rules specify that past attempts are categorized as 'Attempt' regardless of timeframe if described by the author, as here.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of a past suicide attempt (initiated action with lethal means and intent), which fits the 'Attempt' definition. While current suicidal thoughts are mentioned, they are not coupled with a plan or method, and the historical attempt takes precedence. This is not 'Indicator' (no explicit negation of desire), 'Ideation' (beyond thoughts, as an action occurred), or 'Behavior' (no current plan or imminent action described).

   - Desire: The phrase ""suicide has become my quick solution"" implies a personal desire to escape or end life, but it is not explicitly negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in a personal context (""my quick solution"").
   - Yes, it expresses a desire to escape or end life through phrases like ""get away from it all"" and ""suicide has become my quick solution,"" which imply a wish for life to end, especially in the context of despair about the world.
   - No, there is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or plan is mentioned; ""suicide"" is referenced vaguely as a solution.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no notes, acquiring means, or goodbyes).
   - No high imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"") to imply an intended action, even if vague.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past events.
   - No description of past initiated actions (e.g., no attempts like ""I tried to overdose"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicide"" as a personal ""quick solution"" with a desire to escape life indicates suicidal ideation, not general distress alone.
   - No plan, method, preparation, or imminent action is present, ruling out Behavior.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal actions, ruling out Attempt.
   - The desire is not explicitly negated or unwanted, so it does not qualify as Indicator. Phrases like ""suicide has become my quick solution"" align with Ideation.
   - Conclusion: The post fits 'Ideation' due to the personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any plan, method, or action.

408,"About depression. It makes it hard to keep going. Every day feels like the previous one, hearing the voice in death stranding ""*keep on keeping on. *"" over and over. It's even harder for friends or close people to understand how badly mangled (psychically) you are. Feels like only depressed people can understand each other, as a closed circle. It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses depression, difficulty coping (""hard to keep going""), repetitive and unfulfilling days, feeling misunderstood by others, and the persistent nature of depression (""never really goes away""). 
   - There are emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - No references to past suicidal actions, plans, preparations, or imminence of harm. 
   - The writer questions the existence of a cure, indicating distress but not a personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar phrases (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""). 
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living,"" or ""life isn't worth it""). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication they are unwanted. 
   - The phrase ""hard to keep going"" implies struggle but not a wish for death, especially with the reference to ""keep on keeping on,"" which suggests persistence. Leaning towards 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or intended action. 
   - No vague references implying imminent harm. 
   - Without suicidal intent, this step does not apply. Confirms 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and the ongoing nature of depression, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted""). 
   - No initiated suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and the burden of depression but lacks any personal, explicit expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past action. 
   - Phrases like ""hard to keep going"" and questioning a cure indicate distress but are not equivalent to suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be Ideation; here, it's not present). 
   - No suicidal thoughts are mentioned, so it doesn't fit 'Ideation'. Without intent or action, 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' are not applicable. 
   - Fits 'Indicator': the content is about psychological suffering without suicidal elements, focusing on the challenge of living with depression.

   - None present. No references to methods, plans, locations, tools, or preparations for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes historical event (father's suicide) and ongoing distress.

   - No plan/method/preparation (rules out Behavior/Attempt).
   - Past suicide reference is about another person, not the author's action (rules out Attempt).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""i wanna off myself"" and ""if i killed myself,"" indicating a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i can't see it getting better at fucking all""), ambivalence due to fear of missing out (""i'm scared that if i do it i'll miss out on something""), and a conflicted desire for hope (""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timelines for action. The author references therapy and depression but no past or recent suicidal actions. The desire to die is present but tempered by fear and hope, with no indication of imminence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly uses phrases like ""off myself"" and ""killed myself,"" which are explicit references to suicide.
   - Yes, there is a clear personal desire to die expressed (""i wanna off myself""), along with despair (""i fucking hate it here"").
   - The author does not explicitly state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them. Instead, the fear is about consequences (missing out), not a rejection of the desire itself. Phrases like ""i hate it here"" imply genuine suicidal ideation without negation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied. ""Off myself"" is vague slang for suicide but lacks detail.
   - No signs of preparation, such as acquiring means, writing notes, or making arrangements.
   - Despite the explicit desire, there is no indication of a plan or intended action. The fear and hope suggest contemplation rather than intent to act, and imminence is absent (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current feelings and hypothetical future scenarios (""if i killed myself"") but does not describe any past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. References to therapy and depression are not related to suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die with explicit suicidal thoughts, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, preparation, or intended action, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The presence of suicidal desire without a plan or action aligns with 'Ideation'. The ambivalence (fear and hope) does not negate the ideation but is consistent with it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE.""
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""there's no future for me""), self-hatred (""I hate myself""), despair (""I feel so hopeless""), and feeling trapped.
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines for suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned).
   - Expresses conflict about consequences (""I can't leave my parents""), but this does not negate the stated desire to die.
   - No past actions/attempts described; focus is on current thoughts and distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE."" The desire to die is personal, current, and unambiguous. The conflict about parents reflects ambivalence but does not reframe thoughts as *unwanted* (e.g., no language like ""I don’t want these thoughts"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**: No mention of plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight""). Suicidal intent is present, but no actionable steps are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No past/recent actions**: Describes *current* suicidal thoughts and distress. No references to past suicide attempts or initiated self-harm actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Strong explicit desire to die (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"") rules out **Indicator** (which requires absence of personal suicidal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of past initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.
   - **Ideation** fits: Unambiguous expressions of suicidal desire and thoughts, but no plans, methods, or actions indicated.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""contemplating suicide,"" ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it,"" and an agreement to commit suicide together (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together"").
   - Emotional indicators: numbness, lack of joy, hopelessness, self-loathing, and relational distress.
   - Plan/Method: The agreement to die *together* with the other girl constitutes a joint suicide plan, implying coordination and intent. While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is detailed for the author, the mutual pact establishes a preparatory commitment to act.
   - Temporal context: Contemplation is ongoing (""past month""), and the suicide pact is a future-oriented plan contingent on the girl's decision. No past *suicidal actions* by the author are described (self-harm is noted but framed as coping, not a suicide attempt).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""contemplating suicide"" and ""I’m ending it"" express a clear, personal desire to die. The pact (""we will do it together"") confirms mutual suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. The suicide pact (""we will do it together"") is an explicit plan involving coordinated action. While the method is unspecified, the agreement represents preparation and intent to act jointly, especially given the contingency (""if she should want to kill herself"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *future* intent (acting on the pact if the girl proceeds). Self-harm (""cutting"") is mentioned but is distinct from suicidal behavior (it’s noted as a coping mechanism). No past suicide *attempt* by the author is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: The author expresses active suicidal desire (Ideation) *and* a concrete plan (joint suicide pact), moving beyond passive thoughts. The pact implies coordination, timing, and commitment to act, satisfying the ""intended action"" criterion for Behavior. No specific method is named, but the pact’s mutual agreement constitutes a plan. No past suicidal action (Attempt) is attributed to the author.  
   - *Not Ideation*: A plan exists (the pact).  
   - *Not Attempt*: No self-initiated, potentially lethal past action by the author is described.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Desire to die is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post consists entirely of abusive quotes from the author's parents, including direct commands to commit suicide (e.g., ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already""), mockery of past self-harm/suicide attempts (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""Are you going to cut your wrists again?""), and invalidation of the author's mental health.  
   - **Crucially, the author does not express any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past actions.** The only first-person statement from the author is a question to their father (""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place""), which reflects distress but not suicidal intent.  
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm are attributed to the parents, not the author. References to past attempts (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again"") are descriptions of parental taunts, not self-reports by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent is expressed by the author.** The post documents external abuse and invalidation, not the author's internal state.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent.** No personal plans, methods, or preparations are described by the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

   - Parental commands/mockery about suicide do not equate to the author endorsing or acting on those statements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""kill myself"" (from context, ""Kim's"" is likely a typo for ""kill myself""). It focuses on seeking the ""least painful way"" to commit suicide, dismissing alternatives like ""living is the least painful way.""
   - Emotional indicators include distress, urgency (""I just need a way""), and frustration (""I don't wanna hear all this... shit"").
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances), but the user is actively seeking information on methods.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the context is current/future-focused.
   - Imminence is implied through the urgent demand for a ""straight up answer,"" but no explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.
   - The writer expresses a desire to die by seeking methods, with no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill yourself"" and implies ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.
   - Yes, phrases like ""I just need a way to kill myself"" express a clear personal desire to die or for life to end.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the user insists on getting a direct answer, reinforcing the desire to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The user is inquiring about a method (""least painful way to kill yourself""), which implies an interest in planning or preparation, even though no specific method is detailed.
   - There are no signs of concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), but seeking method information can be considered part of planning, especially given the strong desire and urgency.
   - With explicit desire and implied imminence (demanding a ""straight up answer""), this inquiry about methods suggests an intended action, leaning toward Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (seeking methods now) with no mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, Attempt does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Not Indicator: The post expresses a personal desire to die with no indication that thoughts are unwanted.
   - Not Ideation: While there is explicit suicidal desire, the inquiry about methods constitutes planning or intended action, moving it beyond mere thoughts.
   - Behavior: The combination of explicit desire to die and seeking information on methods (even if vague) indicates planning or preparation, especially given the urgency. This aligns with the definition: ""mentions... an intended action (even if the method is vague... coupled with high imminence).""
   - Not Attempt: No description of past or recent initiated actions.
   - Ambiguity note: The method inquiry is vague, but the strong intent and urgency push this toward Behavior.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""write a suicidal note again,"" indicating preparation for suicide and implying recurrence. The phrase ""suicidal note"" explicitly references suicide. 
   - Emotional distress is evident (""stomach convulsing from the pain on the inside""), but the focus is on the preparatory action. 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but writing a suicide note is a recognized preparatory step. 
   - The word ""again"" suggests past instances, but the primary context is a current/future intention (""I think I'm going to""). 
   - Imminence is implied by the present-tense framing (""I think I'm going to""), though no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""suicidal note"" explicitly ties the action to suicide. 
   - The phrase ""write a suicidal note"" inherently expresses a desire to die, as such notes are typically written with the intent to end life. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Writing a suicide note is a clear preparation step, falling under ""preparations being taken"" (e.g., ""writing my suicide note"" from the Behavior definition). 
   - Though no method is specified, the preparation itself suffices for Behavior when combined with explicit suicidal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""I think I'm going to"") and references past behavior (""again""), but the focus is on imminent preparation, not a past initiated action. 
   - No description of a past *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"") is present, so Attempt does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit suicidal intent (via ""suicidal note"") and preparation (writing the note) rule out Indicator (unwanted thoughts) and Ideation (no plan/preparation). 
   - The absence of a described past initiated lethal action rules out Attempt. 
   - The combination of suicidal intent and preparation aligns with Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains key elements: ""committing a massacre"" (which may imply harm to others but is not self-directed) and ""slaying myself"" (a direct reference to self-harm or suicide, equivalent to ""killing myself""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Phrases like ""I will end up"" suggest inevitability and despair, but no explicit hopelessness or burden statements. ""Maybe"" introduces some ambivalence, but the core expresses a personal consideration of suicide.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Slaying myself"" is vague and does not detail a method.
   - No references to past actions; the post is future-oriented (""will end up"").
   - Imminence: ""Will end up"" implies potential future action but lacks high imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - Stated desire: ""Slaying myself"" expresses a personal desire to die, and there is no explicit negation (e.g., no statement that these thoughts are unwanted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""slaying myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide, similar to ""kill myself.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or end life (""I will end up... slaying myself"").
   - No, the suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted or resisted; the ""maybe"" suggests consideration but not rejection of the idea. Therefore, this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned; ""slaying myself"" is vague and lacks detail.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - Intent is present (""I will end up""), but imminence is not high, and the vagueness of the phrase does not imply a concrete plan or action. Without a method or plan, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I will end up"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (""slaying myself""), so it cannot be 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no specific plan, method, preparation, or high-imminence intended action mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The presence of suicidal intent without plan/method/action fits 'Ideation'. The vagueness and conditional ""maybe"" do not change this, as the core expression is a desire to die.

**Conclusion:** The post falls under 'Ideation' due to the explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without any indication of a plan, method, or preparation.

418,"I wish I had friends. I wish I had friends so badly. I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses loneliness, feelings of inadequacy, passivity, academic struggles, and shame. Key elements include:
   - Explicit mention of ""suicidal ideation"" but immediately negated: ""I don’t want to die—I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame..."".
   - No references to death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""can't escape my laziness""), shame (""shame I have of not being anybody""), and distress over inaction.
   - Focus is on distress about unrealized potential and desire for change, not death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""suicidal ideation"" is used, but it is explicitly framed as *unwanted* and disconnected from a genuine desire to die: ""I don’t want to die—I want to live"". The ideation is attributed to shame, not a true wish for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, preparations, or imminent actions related to suicide. The context is entirely introspective about life struggles.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Only abstract ""ideation"" is referenced, with no indication of initiation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core distinction lies in the explicit negation of suicidal desire (""I don’t want to die"") and attribution of ideation to shame rather than genuine intent. This fits **Indicator**, which covers distress, hopelessness, and *explicitly unwanted* suicidal thoughts without personal desire to act. Phrases like ""I hate living"" (absent here) would suggest Ideation, but the author’s clear disavowal of death intent overrules. No plan/behavior/attempt elements exist.

419,"I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head. But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?. I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it. And before anybody says anything, no, I'm not calling a suicide hotline. I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a specific suicidal method: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head."" It expresses a desire to die but includes hesitation due to fear of permanent disability (""I don't want to have to be crippled""). The writer states they are ""not risking it,"" indicating ambivalence but not a rejection of the suicidal desire itself. There is no mention of past actions, preparations (e.g., accessing the handgun), or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). Emotional indicators include distress and hopelessness, but the core focus is on suicidal intent with a method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly states ""shoot myself in the head,"" which is an explicit expression of suicidal intent. The desire to die is clear (""I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself""), and while there is hesitation, it is due to potential consequences, not an explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: using a handgun to shoot in the head. The phrase ""get my dad's handgun"" implies an intended action to acquire the means, but there is no indication that this has been acted upon (e.g., no preparation like ""I have the gun""). However, the mention of a specific method, coupled with the explicit desire to die, meets the criteria for 'Behavior', as the definition includes ""mention of a specific method"" even if vague or conditional. The hesitation (""I'm not risking it"") reduces imminence but does not negate the presence of the method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and potential future actions, not past events. There is no description of a past initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to a previous attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die with a specific method (handgun), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire or unwanted thoughts) and 'Ideation' (which requires no method/plan). Although the writer hesitates and states they are ""not risking it,"" the mention of a specific method qualifies it as 'Behavior' per the definition, which includes ""mention of a specific method"" without requiring preparation or imminence. There is no ambiguity about the method, and no past action for 'Attempt'. Doubt between Ideation and Behavior is resolved by the explicit method reference, so 'Behavior' is appropriate.

My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: None explicit (no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" etc.). Strong expressions of despair: ""life isn't worth living anymore,"" ""can't see myself having a life worth living,"" ""unbearable.""
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""nothing I can enjoy,"" ""helpless""), anger, sadness, and anhedonia.
   - Plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned (no tools, locations, notes, or actions).
   - Past actions: None described.
   - Imminence: No timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire to die: Implied by ""life isn't worth living"" but not explicitly stated as a personal wish (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Focus is on distress and hopelessness.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide or direct phrases (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - No clear, personal expression of *desire* to die (e.g., ""I wish I were dead""). Phrases like ""life isn't worth living"" reflect despair but lack explicit suicidal intent.
   - Suicidal thoughts not mentioned; distress is centered on life circumstances. Leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**
   - None identified. No references to plans, methods, tools, or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Expressions like ""life isn't worth living"" are severe distress markers but lack explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). No suicidal thoughts are articulated, and the focus is on suffering/helplessness. Falls under 'Indicator'.
   - No evidence of plan/method ('Behavior') or past action ('Attempt').

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon."" It expresses hopelessness (""I don't see the point anymore"") and a desire for life to end (""I think I'll be gone""). 
   - There is a timeframe mentioned: ""soon,"" with a specific avoidance of Christmas and a target of ""by February."" However, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described. 
   - The post is focused on future intentions, with no references to past actions or attempts. 
   - The desire to die is personal and not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I think I'll be gone""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While a timeframe (""soon,"" ""by February"") and timing consideration (""not on Christmas"") are mentioned, these relate to when the act might occur, not the how. No specific method, tools, location, or preparations are indicated. The intent is present, but imminence is not high (e.g., ""February"" suggests weeks away, not immediate). Vague references like ""I think I'll be gone"" do not imply a method or plan for the act itself.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes future intentions only. There are no descriptions of past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt or preparatory steps taken).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""I'll be gone"") rules out 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about personal suicidal intent or explicit negation of the desire.
   - The absence of a specific method, plan details, or preparations rules out 'Behavior'. The timeframe alone, without a method or action plan, is insufficient for 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The content fits 'Ideation' best: explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but no plan, method, or intended action described.

422,"I just want to die its that plain and simple. Too many problems, im a fucked up person, gonna end my life this month.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of death/suicide (""want to die,"" ""gonna end my life""). Emotional indicators are present, such as hopelessness (""Too many problems, im a fucked up person""). There is a stated intention to act (""gonna end my life this month""), with a timeframe (""this month"") indicating imminence. No specific method (e.g., tools, location) or preparation (e.g., note, means) is mentioned. The desire to die is personal and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""die"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct phrases indicating suicide. It expresses a clear desire to die (""I just want to die"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. However, there is a stated intention to act (""gonna end my life"") with a specific timeframe (""this month""), which implies a plan or intended action. Given the explicit desire to die and the moderate imminence (within a month), this vague reference to action, coupled with strong intent, leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""gonna end my life this month"") but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post has explicit suicidal desire (ruling out 'Indicator'). While no specific method is detailed, the stated intention to act (""gonna end my life"") with a timeframe (""this month"") constitutes an intended action, moving this beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. The imminence and strong intent support this, even with vagueness in method. There is no past action to qualify as 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" in the context of the author's mental illness and suffering.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""world falling apart,"" ""turn into hell""), suffering, and feeling misunderstood.  
   - No explicit desire to die or end life is stated. Instead, suicidal thoughts are framed as part of a broader understanding of the world (""helped me understand the world"").  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or imminent intent is mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""if you are mental ill or suicidal"" suggests the author is discussing suicidal thoughts abstractly or as an ongoing struggle, not expressing a current personal urge to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - The author mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does **not** express a current, personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I can't live"").  
   - The thoughts are presented as part of their mental illness and are **not** accompanied by a stated wish to act on them. Instead, they are contextualized as contributing to their worldview.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **None identified.** No references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or initiated behaviors).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned retrospectively (""helped me"") without indication of progression to action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The key phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" could initially suggest 'Ideation,' but the author **lacks a clear, current expression of personal desire to die**.  
   - The thoughts are framed as unwanted/distressing components of mental illness (""suffering,"" ""mental illnesses"") and are discussed abstractly.  
   - No plan, method, or intent elevates this to 'Behavior' or 'Attempt.'  
   - Meets 'Indicator' criteria: Distress and abstract discussion of suicidal thoughts without personal intent to act.

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating direct references to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothings gonna work,"" ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life,"" ""I'm done being this sad fucked up person"") and a sense of entrapment (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution""). A specific plan is implied with ""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"" and ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out,"" showing intended action with a timeframe. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned, but the birthday timing and planning intent are clear. No past actions or attempts are described. Imminence is not high, as the act is deferred to a future date (""birthday""), allowing time for planning. The desire for suicide is presented as a ""viable solution"" without any negation (e.g., no statement that thoughts are unwanted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""suicide"" and ""kill myself."" It expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""only viable solution""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or not representative of the author's current desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific plan is mentioned: the suicide is intended to occur ""on my birthday,"" with explicit reference to planning (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""). Although no method is specified, the stated intention to act on a specific date, coupled with the author's strong intent (e.g., ""it feels like only viable solution""), constitutes an intended action. This meets the threshold for 'Behavior' as it includes a plan element (timing) and preparation (planning phase).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of previous attempts). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (suicide as a ""solution""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal desire). The presence of a plan (birthday timing and planning intent) elevates it from 'Ideation' (thoughts without plan/action) to 'Behavior'. While the method is vague, the stated intention to act on a specific date and the planning context indicate intended action, aligning with 'Behavior' definition. No past actions qualify for 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""dealing with my depression,"" ""I'm a failure,"" ""I don't deserve love or happiness,"" ""Burden on my family,"" ""fighting this battle alone.""  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""thinking of ending it all.""  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeline, or location mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions.  
   - The phrase ""ending it all"" indicates a desire to die, with no negation (e.g., no ""but I won’t act on it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""thinking of ending it all"" is a direct expression of suicidal ideation.  
   - Strong desire to die is implied through self-loathing and hopelessness (""what is the point anymore"").  
   - No statement rejecting or disavowing the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of a method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""), or preparations (e.g., writing a note).

I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit expressions of desire: ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" and ""my death will be following very soon"" strongly imply a personal wish to end life.  
   - Preparation: Mention of creating a will (""get a will in place"") to distribute assets is a concrete step toward finalizing affairs.  
   - Imminence: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" specifies a timeframe (within days).  
   - Emotional context: Guilt about impacting the mother (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom"") but no negation of suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""Do this once and for all,"" ""get it over with,"" and ""my death"" are unambiguous expressions of a desire to die. No disclaimers (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"") are present. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Preparation: Drafting a will is a direct action tied to anticipated death.  
   - Imminence + Intent: ""Attempt this weekend"" signals imminent action, and ""do this"" implies a method (though unspecified). Preparation + imminent intent qualifies as 'Behavior'. → **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""will attempt,"" ""this weekend"") and preparation (will). No past actions described. → Not 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (→ not 'Indicator').  
   - Preparation (will) and imminent plan (""attempt this weekend"") confirm 'Behavior'.  
   - No past initiated lethal action (→ not 'Attempt').  
   - Vagueness of method is overridden by clear intent, preparation, and imminence.

I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post discusses a test that will determine whether the author lives until October, expressing ambivalence about life (""it's not like I wanna live either"") but explicitly states not wanting to die currently (""for the first time I don't wanna die""). There are mentions of suicide methods (overdosing on meds, jumping, cutting with blades) and barriers to these methods (no access to meds, no place to jump, blades not deep enough). Emotional indicators include hopelessness tied to failing the test (""I really cannot live if I fail"") but also current positive feelings (""almost happy,"" ""decent place,"" ""want to keep doing things""). No specific plans or preparations for suicide are described; instead, the author is focused on life-oriented activities (moving, projects). References to past self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") are noted, but this is not described as a suicide attempt. Imminence is conditional on failing the test, with no immediate timeframe. The desire to die is explicitly negated in the present context.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" It expresses a conditional desire to die if the test is failed (""I really cannot live if I fail""), but this is not a current, personal expression of wanting to die. Crucially, the author explicitly states they do not want to die now (""I don't wanna die,"" ""I want to keep doing things""), indicating that any suicidal thoughts are unwanted or conditional, not reflecting a genuine present desire. This leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Methods are mentioned (meds, jumping, cutting), but only in the context of being unavailable or ineffective (e.g., ""no access,"" ""no place,"" ""won't go that deep""). There is no indication of current planning, preparation, or intended action; instead, the author discusses life plans (e.g., moving, projects). With the explicit negation of current desire to die and no imminence (action is contingent on a future event), this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The method references appear to be historical or hypothetical, not part of a current plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future conditional scenario (failing the test leading to death) and past self-harm (""used to cut""), but the self-harm is not framed as a suicide attempt—it lacks context of being a potentially lethal, initiated action. No past or recent suicide attempt is described. The primary focus is on current feelings and future life-oriented intentions, not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author explicitly negates current suicidal desire (""I don't wanna die"") and expresses unwanted or conditional thoughts about suicide, aligning with 'Indicator'. While there are mentions of methods and conditional hopelessness, the absence of a current desire to die, plan, or preparation rules out 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. The past self-harm reference does not constitute an 'Attempt' as it is not described as a suicidal action. Ambivalence is resolved by the clear statement of not wanting to die, making 'Indicator' the best fit.

428,"I feel as if all I've done through school and my other trials all just go to support the things I hate and that we're only seen as special if people need or want something from us. School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness, disillusionment with societal systems (""stuck in a system""), exhaustion (""drained me the fuck out""), and loss of purpose (""don't know what to do anymore""). Key elements include:  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling drained, lack of motivation, perceived uselessness of efforts, feeling trapped/exploited.  
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - No references to past/current suicidal actions.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings (e.g., ""neverending process""), no imminent timeframes.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Expressions like ""taken my will to strive"" and ""don't know what to do anymore"" convey despair but **lack a clear desire for death or life to end** (e.g., no ""I hate living"" or ""I want to disappear"").  
   - **No discussion of suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to plans, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **ongoing emotional struggle**, not past/future actions. No descriptions of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong distress/hopelessness is present, but **no personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**.  
   - Phrases like ""don't know what to do anymore"" reflect existential crisis, not active suicidality.  
   - **Fits 'Indicator'**: General distress without suicidal intent, ideation, or behavior.

Either kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun, or start cutting myself to try and ease my pain. My existence has been nothing but depression, fear, regret and worthlessness. Its a net gain for the world if i die. I'm such a fucking dumbass and a lazy asshole. How stupid am I to fail senior year. How stupid am I to still want the love and affection from a family that is toxic, gaslighting, mean and fake. Why couldn't I have been aborted. I'm just waiting for the end. I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold. My body probably wouldn't be found for months until my bills start rising.

Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""depression, fear, regret, worthlessness,"" ""I fucking hate myself,"" ""I'm sad,"" ""I want help... But I'm afraid.""
   - Specific methods: Slitting wrists, shooting with a gun, and cutting (though cutting is mentioned as a means to ""ease pain,"" it is listed alongside explicit suicide methods).
   - Preparations/intentions: ""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"" (directly linked to suicide methods). Also, ""I'm just waiting for the end,"" ""ready to slip into unconsciousness and die.""
   - Imminence: No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but the phrase ""waiting for the end"" and conditional planning (""Once I get a place"") imply intent to act when circumstances allow.
   - Desire: Clear expressions of a wish to die (""Its a net gain for the world if I die,"" ""Why couldn't I have been aborted""), coupled with distress. The plea for help (""I want help so badly"") does not negate the expressed desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and specific methods. Profound declarations of wanting life to end (e.g., ""net gain for the world if I die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (slitting wrists, shooting with a gun) are explicitly stated. Preparations are implied (""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""), indicating intent to act when possible. The context of high despair and detailed methods supports a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **future intentions** (""I'll finally be able to do...""), not past actions. No mention of prior attempts or initiated actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent are present; thoughts are not framed as unwanted.
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific methods (slitting wrists, shooting) and conditional plans (""Once I get a place..."") move this beyond mere desire/thoughts.
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past or recent initiated actions.
   - **Behavior**: Strong suicidal intent + specific methods + implied preparation/intent to act (conditional on obtaining a place). Imminence is moderate (dependent on logistics), but the specificity of methods and linkage to action (""I'll... do what I want to do"") confirms Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, feelings of hopelessness (""This world is shit""), paranoia (""people around me are out to get me""), worthlessness (""why am I so unlovable""), and confusion (""I seriously don't know what's real""). It references relationship struggles, abandonment issues, and possible PTSD. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. The strongest emotional expressions are frustration (e.g., ""SOMEONE TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH!"") and despair about life circumstances, but no explicit or implicit references to ending life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.
   - No expressions of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die"" are absent). The closest emotional expressions (""I want to cry my damn eyes out"") reflect acute distress, not a wish for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, wanted or unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No references to plans, methods (tools, locations, substances), preparations, or intended actions related to self-harm or suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No descriptions of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm). Mentions of past events (breakup, possible PTSD) are contextual but not action-oriented toward suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt. Phrases like ""this world is shit"" or ""I'm so unlovable"" indicate profound despair but do not cross into explicit suicidal ideation. Without evidence of suicidal thoughts or intent (explicit or strongly implied), the post fits 'Indicator'.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""wanna kill myself,"" ""contemplated and devised almost every possible way,"" specific methods (ingesting isopropyl alcohol, hanging, jumping in front of a car), detailed planning (calculating dosage, testing attachment points, timing), and preparations (ensuring family won't interrupt).  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I hate myself,"" ""I want to die,"" ""nothing works anymore""), self-loathing (""burden,"" ""failure""), guilt (feeling responsible for mother's death), and isolation.  
   - Plan/Method: Multiple specific methods described with practical steps (e.g., dose calculation, structural testing).  
   - Imminence: Current contemplation (""right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"") but no immediate timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""I want to die"") but conflicted by belief they ""don’t deserve"" death as punishment.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases (""wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die"").  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""life isn’t worth it,"" ""I want to die""). No explicit negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act""); instead, restraint is due to guilt, not lack of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (alcohol poisoning, hanging, vehicular impact) with concrete steps (dose calculations, strength testing, timing observations).  
   - **Yes**: Preparations described (researching, planning logistics to avoid detection).  
   - Context: High intent + detailed planning confirms 'Behavior' despite self-restraint.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Past**: Suicidal thoughts ""for years,"" planning during quarantine (past/recent).  
   - **Current**: Actively ""contemplating suicide"" with existing plans.  
   - **No past action**: Describes *planning* and *ideation*, but no initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself""). Rules out 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit desire to die and personal suicidal intent (not abstract/unwanted thoughts).  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Detailed plans/methods/preparations go beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of past/current initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Strong desire to die + specific, actionable plans/preparations, even if execution is delayed by guilt.  
   - *Key nuance*: Restraint (""I don’t do it"") stems from self-punishment, not reluctance to act—plans remain active and developed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly and discusses a chosen day for suicide that is ""very soon."" It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness (""i'm not cut out for life,"" ""i can't even imagine mine being worth living"") and a long-standing desire to die (""i've wanted to do this for over a decade""). There are references to preparatory actions, such as considering calling grandparents, telling friends they love them, and hugging their brother, which may be farewell gestures. The user dismisses anti-suicide discourse, indicating a firm desire to proceed. No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, and there is no description of past suicide attempts or actions initiated by the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die through phrases like ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade"" (where ""this"" contextually means suicide) and ""i'm not cut out for life."" The thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, the user rejects intervention (""i'm not interested in being talked down""), confirming a genuine desire to die. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method is described, there is a plan indicated by ""the day i chose is very soon,"" showing temporal imminence. The consideration of calling loved ones (e.g., grandparents, friends) and expressing affection (e.g., hugging brother) is interpreted as preparatory behavior in the context of impending suicide, as the user worries these actions might ""haunt people"" or be seen as an attempt to ""be talked down."" This aligns with preparatory actions like ""saying goodbye"" mentioned in the guidelines. Given the high imminence (""very soon"") and the explicit desire to die, these vague references to action support 'Behavior' over 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""the day i chose is very soon"") and current preparatory thoughts, not past actions. There is no description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). The reference to wanting to die ""for over a decade"" is about persistent desire, not a specific past attempt, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator'. The lack of a described past lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. The key distinction is between 'Ideation' (desire without plan/preparation) and 'Behavior' (desire with plan/preparation/intended action). Here, the chosen day (""very soon"") and preparatory actions (calling loved ones as potential farewells) indicate a plan and intended behavior, even if the method is vague. Due to the high imminence and context, this leans strongly to 'Behavior'. There is no genuine uncertainty after analysis— the preparatory elements coupled with intent confirm 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: 
     - Mentions of suicide: ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months"" explicitly references suicidal feelings.
     - Emotional indicators: ""feel like abandoning everyone,"" ""I've been in pain for over 5 years,"" ""I just cba anymore"" (indicating apathy/exhaustion), ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" (expressing hopelessness and a desire to end suffering).
     - Plan/method/preparation: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, location) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. ""Not going to contact anyone i know for a while"" suggests isolation but is not explicitly tied to suicide preparation; it could indicate general withdrawal.
     - Past actions: References past suicidal intensity (""most suicidal I've been in a couple months"") but does not describe any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").
     - Imminence: No time frame for action (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the desire is expressed generally.
     - Stated desire: ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" implies a genuine wish to die, with no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""want to be out of my misery""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated. This leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The isolation (""Not going to contact anyone"") is vague and not clearly part of a suicidal plan. With high desire but no method/preparation and no high imminence, this points to 'Ideation', not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal feelings and a general desire to end misery, but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an attempt). The reference to past suicidal intensity is about feelings, not actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) without any plan, method, or preparation. Phrases like ""I Just want to be out of my misery"" and ""most suicidal"" confirm 'Ideation'. There is no evidence of unwanted thoughts (which would be 'Indicator'), no plan/method for 'Behavior', and no described past action for 'Attempt'. Isolation is concerning but insufficient for 'Behavior' without explicit suicidal context.

434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct mentions of death and suicide: ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself."" These are explicit expressions of suicidal desire.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""Why is it so hard to die"") and a sense of hopelessness about achieving death.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation described (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances mentioned). The phrase ""can't find a suitable way to go"" indicates the author is considering methods but has not identified or acted on one.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., attempts) are present.
   - Imminence is not indicated; the language is general (""want to,"" not ""will tonight"").
   - The desire to die is clear and personal, with no explicit negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it""). The frustration about difficulty dying reinforces the desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to die"").
   - No, there is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the author expresses genuine desire for death, coupled with frustration about barriers.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. The author states they ""can't find a suitable way,"" which implies consideration of methods but no concrete plan or selection.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - Despite the strong desire and frustration, the vagueness about a ""way to go"" does not constitute a plan or intended action. With no imminence or specificity, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and desires, not past events. There is no mention of any initiated action (e.g., no reference to a past attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because the author expresses a personal, explicit desire to die with suicidal intent, not just distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation—only a vague consideration of methods without specificity or action.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent self-initiated lethal action is described.
   - The post fits 'Ideation': explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die (""I just want to die,"" ""I just want to kill myself"") with no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation. The frustration about finding a ""suitable way"" does not constitute a plan; it reinforces ideation without crossing into behavior.

Im worried that how i can devolp a second language by moving there?. Is it worth guys,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions being at a ""low point,"" having ""zero social skills,"" ""low self-esteem,"" and feeling ""lonely."" It expresses worry about developing a second language and questions if moving to another country is ""worth it"" for better living. There are no references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""low point,"" loneliness) and distress, but no explicit desire to die. The user seeks ""help"" and ""ADVICE"" for practical life decisions, indicating a focus on improvement rather than ending life. No plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide are mentioned. Imminence of harm is absent, and the stated desire is for support and honest feedback, not for life to end.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No expression of a clear desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent; ""I wish i had them in the frist place"" refers to social skills/living conditions, not death). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no statement about them being unwanted. 
   - Leaning towards 'Indicator' due to the absence of personal suicidal desire and the presence of general distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide. 
   - The content focuses on contemplating a life change (moving countries) and language barriers, with no implied or vague references to self-harm. 
   - No indication of intended action related to suicide, even with high imminence. 
   - This step does not shift the classification from 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and future intentions about relocating, but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). 
   - Timeframe is irrelevant here as no actions are discussed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and loneliness but lacks a personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Key phrases like ""low point"" and concerns about self-worth are indicators of emotional struggle but do not cross into suicidal ideation (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or similar). The explicit request for advice and help reinforces a focus on coping and improvement. 
   - No elements align with 'Ideation' (no suicidal thoughts/desire), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no past action). 
   - Ambiguity is resolved in favor of 'Indicator' as the distress is present but without suicidal desire, and thoughts are not explicitly unwanted (since they are not mentioned).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses anger and a death wish towards another person (""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP"") due to a reported post leading to an account ban. 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the author. Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair about the author's own life are absent. The focus is on hostility towards someone else, not personal distress about the author's existence. 
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for self-harm are mentioned. The ""ASAP"" imminence refers to the other person's death, not the author's actions. 
   - There is no reference to past suicidal actions or thoughts by the author. The author's stated desire is for harm to come to another, not a personal wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or phrases like ""kill myself"" by the author. 
   - No clear desire for the author's own death or life to end is expressed. The death-related content is solely directed at another person. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply. 
   - Conclusion: No personal suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No method, tool, or plan for self-harm is mentioned. The content is about wishing harm to others, not actionable steps by the author. 
   - No preparations (e.g., suicide notes, acquiring means) are indicated. 
   - Since there is no suicidal desire from the author, this step is irrelevant for classification.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references a past event (account ban) but describes no self-initiated actions by the author, such as a suicide attempt. 
   - No historical or recent suicidal actions by the author are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (anger, frustration) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, behavior, or past attempt. 
   - Violent wishes towards others do not constitute suicidal risk for the author, per the rule that classification focuses solely on the writer. 
   - There is no ambiguity about suicidal desire for the author, as the content is externally directed. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'. 
   - 'Indicator' applies because the post shows distress (anger) without personal suicidal intent, and it discusses death abstractly (in relation to others) but not in a self-referential or suicidal context.

I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicide"" in an abstract context (""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), but this is a general statement, not a personal expression.  
   - Expresses intent to kill another person (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her""), not self-harm or suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: Frustration and anger toward a bully, desire for ""peace,"" but no despair/hopelessness about the author's own life.  
   - No references to personal death, dying, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations for suicide.  
   - No past or current suicidal actions by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die,"" ""I hate living"").  
   - Mentions suicide abstractly (as a ""type"" involving killing others), but the author’s focus is on homicide (""kill her,"" ""murder her""), not self-inflicted harm.  
   - The phrase ""to finally live my life in peace"" negates suicidal desire; the goal is eliminating the bully to improve life, not end it.  
   → **No personal suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No plan/method for suicide; all violent intent is directed externally (detailed plan to kill the bully).  
   - Author seeks suggestions for homicide (""how to murder her""), not self-harm.  
   → **No suicidal plan or behavior**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future homicidal intent (""I will kill her""), not suicidal actions.  
   - No past or current suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  
   → **No suicidal attempt or behavior**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - No personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, or past attempt.  
   - Abstract mention of suicide is contextual to homicide, not self-harm.  
   - Primary content expresses distress and violent ideation toward others, falling under **general distress** (Indicator).  
   - Rules: Suicide risk applies only to the author, who shows no suicidal intent.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""cannot do this anymore,"" ""mental health really bad,"" ""disappointment and failure.""  
   - Specific plan/method implied: ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests a concrete plan or method.  
   - Imminence: ""on the verge"" indicates urgency.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""want to end it all""). No negation of intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. Direct phrases (""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all"") and clear desire to die without negation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - ""I know exactly what to do"" implies a specific plan/method, especially given high imminence (""on the verge"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes current/future intention. No mention of past initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + implied plan/method (""know exactly what to do"") = **Behavior**.  
   - High imminence (""on the verge"") reinforces this. No historical attempt described.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains direct phrases like ""kill me"" and ""wanna die,"" indicating a personal desire for death. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions are mentioned. The timeframe is vague, with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer expresses a genuine wish to die without negation (e.g., no statement that these thoughts are unwanted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention: Yes, ""kill me"" and ""wanna die"" are direct expressions of suicidal ideation.
   - Clear desire to die: Yes, ""I just wanna die"" explicitly states a personal wish for life to end.
   - Unwanted thoughts: No, there is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to"").
   - Leaning towards 'Ideation' due to explicit personal desire without negation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., nothing about pills, guns, notes, or goodbyes).
   - Despite the strong desire, there is no reference to intended action, plan, or means. The context lacks imminence or vagueness that could imply behavior (e.g., no phrases like ""tonight"" or ""planning to"").
   - Therefore, no elements of 'Behavior' are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings, not past events. No mention of any past initiated actions (e.g., no references to attempts or self-harm).
   - Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I just wanna die""), meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. Phrases like ""wanna die"" are strong indicators of suicidal ideation unless negated, which they are not.
   - It lacks any plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. There are no past actions for 'Attempt'. The explicit personal desire distinguishes it from 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity or statement of unwanted thoughts.
   - Final category: Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness (""always had unhappy life,"" ""tired of being unhappy, lost and alone,"" ""tired of being depressed""), and despair related to sexuality, gender dysphoria, and past trauma (molestation). 
   - There are **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means**. 
   - The writer repeatedly pleads for divine intervention to ""make me straight,"" ""make me normal,"" and remove ""gayness,"" ""gender disphoria,"" and ""depression."" 
   - The closest reference to unwanted thoughts is ""take all thoughts away from my mind,"" but this explicitly refers to same-sex attraction/gender dysphoria, **not suicidal thoughts**. 
   - There is **no stated desire to die**, no reference to suicide (explicit or implied), no plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm/suicide. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No** explicit mention of suicide, death, or phrases like ""kill myself."" 
   - **No** expressions of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent). Distress is directed at identity/emotional pain, not existence itself. 
   - **No** discussion of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None** identified. The post focuses on a plea for transformation/relief, not actionable plans for self-harm. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes past trauma (molestation at age 5) and lifelong unhappiness, but **no mention of past or recent suicidal actions or attempts**. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and depression but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, ideation, plan, behavior, or past attempt**. 
   - Distress is centered on identity, trauma, and a plea for change, **not a wish to die**. Phrases like ""tired of being depressed"" reflect suffering, not suicidal intent. 
   - Without any suicidal intent, ideation, or behavior, this fits **Indicator** (expresses distress/risk factors but no current personal suicidal desire or action).

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses chronic knee pain, frustration with lack of improvement (""It's been 8 months, with no change in sight""), and a rhetorical question asking if anyone else feels suicidal due to similar pain. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair about the pain (e.g., ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""no change in sight""), but no direct personal mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm by the author. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions related to suicide are present. The suicidal reference is framed as a general question about others (""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?""), not a personal statement. There is no indication of imminence or a stated personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention personal suicide intent (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). The word ""suicidal"" is used in a question about others, not as an expression of the author's own feelings. There is no clear desire to die expressed by the author; instead, the focus is on distress from pain. Suicidal thoughts are not attributed to the author personally, so there is no need to assess if they are unwanted. This leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The post centers on the experience of pain and its persistence, with no reference to intended actions. Even considering the hopelessness, there is no implied plan or method tied to suicidal behavior. This rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing pain over 8 months but no past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author (e.g., no mentions of ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The suicidal reference is hypothetical and directed at others, not a report of the author's history. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness related to physical pain but lacks a personal, explicit expression of suicidal desire. The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" is abstract and inquires about others, not a statement of the author's own ideation. Phrases indicating a personal wish to die (e.g., ""I hate living"") are absent. With no plan, method, or action, and no personal suicidal intent, this aligns with 'Indicator'. The distress is clear, but the suicidal element is not personal or current for the author.

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now. Not only do I feel distant from my friends, family and everything else around me but also my lover who's supposed to guide me through this pain and make me feel right. After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over. I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death and not feel so guilty. Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The post includes ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death"" and references someone else's suicide (""Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life""), with the author finding comfort in the idea of reuniting in death. It also states ""I'm over life"" and ""its finally over"" after making ""one last record,"" implying an end to life.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""destroyed me mentally,"" ""I don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose""), despair, loneliness (""I feel alone""), and guilt.
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" suggests an intention to act after a task, but it is vague and not tied to a concrete plan or method. The phrase ""give in to the nothingness"" is metaphorical and abstract.
   - Past actions: The author references someone else's suicide but does not describe any self-initiated past suicide attempts or actions by themselves.
   - Imminence: ""Finally over"" and ""looking forward to"" imply a future intention but lack high imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The timing is not specified.
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a personal desire to die through phrases like ""I'm over life"" and ""looking forward to... death."" These are profound expressions of wanting life to end, indicating suicidal ideation. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""), so this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""one last record"" and ""finally over"" hints at an intention but is too vague to constitute a plan or method, especially without details on how the action would be carried out. Even with the desire to die, the lack of concrete elements means this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and future intentions (""finally over,"" ""looking forward to""), with no description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions by the author. The mention of someone else's suicide is not the author's action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm over life,"" ""looking forward to... death""), which fits 'Ideation'. There is no explicit plan, method, preparation, or high-imminence intention to act (e.g., the ""one last record"" statement is ambiguous and not actionable). The lack of unwanted thoughts rules out 'Indicator', and the absence of a specific plan or past attempt rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. Strong expressions like ""I'm over life"" are explicitly categorized under 'Ideation' in the definition. Any vagueness in the ""finally over"" phrase is insufficient to elevate this to 'Behavior' due to low imminence and no method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""I want to die,"" which directly references death/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include anger and resentment toward the mother (""I want to make my mom feel pain,"" ""She belittles me""), and the expression ""I want to die so she can feel pain and hurt"" indicates a desire for life to end as a means to cause emotional impact.
   - There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) described. The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" is vague and does not specify a method, location, or actionable steps; it seems to express uncertainty about the extent of the pain or outcome rather than a concrete suicide plan.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., attempts) are present; the focus is on current feelings and future intent without a stated timeframe.
   - Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to die"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions death (""I want to die"") and expresses a clear, personal desire for life to end in the context of causing pain to another. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates the desire (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""I don't want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' and indicates suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation is mentioned. The vague phrase ""wherever it is"" could imply consideration of a method or location, but it is ambiguous and not coupled with high imminence or intent to act immediately. Without clear evidence of a plan, method, or intended action, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. The explicit desire to die is present, but the lack of concrete details or preparatory steps supports 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and a future-oriented desire (""I want to die""), but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to die""), which aligns with 'Ideation' (expressions of suicidal thoughts or wanting life to end without a specific plan or method).
   - There is no evidence of unwanted thoughts (which would indicate 'Indicator'), no plan/method/preparation (which would indicate 'Behavior'), and no description of past initiated actions (which would indicate 'Attempt').
   - The vagueness in ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" does not imply a plan or intended action, especially without imminence, so 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions multiple methods: ""starve myself"" (ongoing), ""hanging myself,"" and preference for a gun (""quicker, painless"").  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I just want my death to come faster,"" ""dead by the end of the week.""  
   - Active preparation: ""I've started to try and starve myself"" (ongoing action) and planning imminence (""dead by end of week"").  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""lost everything,"" ""useless""), self-hatred, and perceived burden (""nuisance"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Explicit phrases: ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""want my death to come faster,"" ""dead by end of week."" Desire is unambiguous and not negated.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (starvation, hanging, gun) are named. Preparation is confirmed: ""started to try and starve myself"" (active self-harm with lethal intent). Imminence is high (""end of week"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** with ongoing preparatory action (active starvation). No past *initiated* lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + specific methods (starvation, hanging, gun) + active preparation (ongoing starvation) + high imminence (""end of week"").  
   - *Not Attempt*: No past initiated lethal action described (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself"" would qualify).  
   - *Not Ideation*: Plan/method/preparation is present and active.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Unambiguous personal desire to die with actionable intent.

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going.

I need to be able to feel at least some small happiness again. How do I go on?",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide planning (""I plan my suicide every single day"") and specific methods (""using a pistol or an escape bag,"" ""douse myself in gasoline and light up""). Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""My life has already been over for six years now""), anhedonia (""Nothing interests me anymore""), despair (""I'm so tired of going through the motions""), and anger. There is no reference to past suicidal actions; the focus is on current/future intentions. Imminence is implied through daily planning but not specified (e.g., no ""tonight"" or immediate timeframe). The writer's desire to die is expressed, but there is also a plea for help (""How do I go on?""), though suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and describes a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""I plan my suicide every single day""). Suicidal thoughts are not negated as unwanted; instead, they are framed as a coping mechanism (""the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned (""pistol,"" ""escape bag,"" ""douse myself in gasoline and light up""), and the writer refers to ongoing planning (""I plan my suicide every single day""). This indicates intended action, even though imminence is not high (e.g., no immediate timeframe). Preparations aren't described (e.g., no note-writing or acquiring means), but the explicit methods and daily planning suffice for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (daily suicide planning) but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions. References to ""old injuries"" and nerve damage are not related to suicidal behavior. Thus, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (Ideation) combined with specific methods and planning (Behavior), not just distress without intent (Indicator). There is no past action (Attempt). The presence of methods (""pistol,"" ""gasoline"") and daily planning confirms 'Behavior', as vague plan/method ambiguity is absent. Imminence isn't high, but the specificity of methods and intent overrides this, per guidelines.

Humans only care about you, when they get something from you. God left me alone, he never answered my prayers. I was in therapy on and off since I was 15. I gave hypnosis a try in hope it would make things better. But my life is just full of rape, abuse and suffering. and I'm such a chicken.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific suicidal actions: standing on a chair with a rope around the neck (recent), cutting wrists at age 11, laying on a road at 19, and jumping in front of a train at 24.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""I can't go on like this,"" hopelessness, trauma (rape, abuse), isolation (""I have nobody""), and self-deprecation (""I'm such a chicken"").  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I've been suicidale all my life,"" frustration about past failures (""everytime I try I fail"").  
   - Recent potentially lethal action: Standing on a chair with a rope around the neck (""Today I failed"").  
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don’t want to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicidale all my life,"" descriptions of past attempts, and ""I just can’t pull myself together and just do it"" confirm a persistent, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods are described for both past attempts (cutting, laying on road, jumping in front of train) and the recent event (rope around neck). Preparations are implied (tying the rope, positioning on the chair).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past initiated actions** (cutting wrists, jumping in front of train) and a **very recent initiated action** (standing on a chair with a rope). The latter is self-interrupted (""failed"") but qualifies as an initiated, potentially lethal act. Timeframe (""today"") confirms recency.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes suicidal desire and multiple past attempts, but the **recent, self-initiated action** (standing with the rope) is the most critical element.  
   - Rules state: ""**Attempt**"" applies to past/very recent self-initiated lethal actions, even if interrupted or failed.  
   - ""Attempt"" takes precedence over ""Behavior"" or ""Ideation"" because a concrete action was initiated by the author.

447,"Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die. As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions death and dying in a passive, accepting manner (""if I die then I die,"" ""accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier""). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""it's not worth pushing my life further,"" ""the future is really grim""). However, there is no explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. The user explicitly states, ""I don't have any plans to end it,"" and frames the behavior (not going to doctors) as a form of fatalistic resignation rather than an active suicidal act. No past suicidal actions are described, and there is no imminence indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer's desire appears to be about accepting natural death, not a genuine wish to die by suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The question ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"" is abstract and not a personal expression of intent. Expressions like ""if I die then I die"" and ""willing to accept when my time has come"" convey resignation but not a clear, personal desire to die—especially when coupled with the denial of plans (""I don't have any plans to end it""). There is no mention of suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted. The primary sentiment is distress about life's grimness, not a wish for death. Thus, explicit suicidal intent is absent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. Not going to doctors is presented as neglect leading to potential natural death, not as a means to actively end life. There is no indication of preparation (e.g., no suicide note, acquiring means, or goodbye messages). With no explicit desire to die and no plan/method, this does not suggest behavioral elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current feelings and an ongoing decision (not visiting doctors) but no past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The reference to accepting death is future-oriented but passive and non-specific. No historical suicide attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and a fatalistic outlook on life but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""it's not worth pushing my life further"" and ""the future is really grim"" indicate emotional distress, but they are not equivalent to explicit ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""). The explicit denial of plans (""I don't have any plans to end it"") and the abstract question about suicide further support that this is not ideation. With no plan, method, or action, and no past attempt described, the content aligns with 'Indicator'. The ambiguity leans toward Indicator due to the absence of personal suicidal desire after careful consideration.

448,"I just fucking hate myself. The title really says it all. I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" directly, indicating a reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include self-hatred (""I just fucking hate myself""), hopelessness (""too depressed to have actual friends,"" ""too ugly to have a significant other""), and feelings of inadequacy (""coward,"" ""lazy"").
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide described. The phrase ""starve myself or something"" is in the context of weight loss struggles due to thyroid issues, not as a suicide method or plan.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Imminence is low; the author states they are ""too much of a coward to kill themselves,"" implying no immediate intent to act.
   - The writer expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") but explicitly negates the action due to cowardice, suggesting distress rather than a current intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - The desire to die is implied but not clearly expressed as a current intent; instead, it is coupled with a reason for not acting (""too much of a coward"").
   - The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to die""), but the action is negated, leaning towards distress about the thoughts rather than a firm desire to die. This supports 'Indicator' if the primary sentiment is distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. ""Starve myself"" is unrelated to suicide.
   - No signs of planning or intended action for suicide; the cowardice statement indicates no action is intended.
   - With low imminence and no vague references to action, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions.
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") but negates action due to cowardice, indicating distress rather than a current personal desire to die. This aligns with 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are not acted upon and the primary sentiment is self-criticism and hopelessness.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because, while there is a mention of suicidal thoughts, the desire to die is not clearly expressed without negation; the cowardice statement suggests the thoughts are not desired or acted upon.
   - 'Behavior' is not applicable due to the absence of any plan, method, or intended action.
   - 'Attempt' is not relevant as no past or recent suicidal actions are described.
   - There is ambiguity in suicidal desire after careful consideration: the phrase ""kill myself"" is strong, but the context (cowardice preventing action) and lack of plan support 'Indicator' as the thoughts are implied to be unwanted or not acted upon.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>

   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the author. 
   - No imminence of intentions; the content is about general help for others. 
   - The author expresses no personal desire to die or for life to end; instead, they emphasize helping friends in distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases from the author. 
   - No clear desire to die or for life to end is expressed by the author; phrases like ""I hate living"" are absent. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned only in reference to a friend, not the author, and there is no indication of unwanted personal thoughts. 
   - Since suicidal intent is not personally expressed, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for the author. 
   - The content is about helping others, with no implied or vague references to personal action. 
   - With no desire to die established, this does not meet criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post does not describe any past or recent actions initiated by the author related to suicide. 
   - References to suicide are about a friend's situation, not the author's experiences. 
   - No basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks personal expressions of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or actions from the author. 
   - It discusses suicide abstractly in the context of helping others, which fits 'Indicator' (general distress or abstract discussion without personal suicidal intent). 
   - 'Ideation' is not applicable, as there is no personal desire to die. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' require personal intent or actions, which are absent. 
   - The suicide risk corresponds only to the author, and no personal risk is indicated.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: Expresses profound hopelessness (""waste of life,"" ""no reason to live""), isolation, self-blame (""bad karma""), and despair. Explicitly states ""suicide is their life's purpose"" and feeling ""content with that."" Mentions discontinuing medication, heavy drinking, and fear that losing Ativan access will lead to crisis. Directly references ""killing myself"" and implies intent driven by fear of hospitalization. Strong emotional indicators include worthlessness, perceived betrayal, and acceptance of death (""nature is telling me it's time to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. Explicit phrases: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""killing myself."" Expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I feel like I am finally becoming content with that,"" ""nature is just telling me it's time to die""). No negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** mentioned. While discontinuing medication/drinking worsens risk, these are not framed as suicide methods. Fear of commitment and lying to avoid hospitalization suggests *potential* future action but lacks concrete details (method, timing, tools). Vague references (""drive me further to killing myself"") lack actionable specifics.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes *current* suicidal acceptance and ideation but **no past or recent self-initiated lethal action**. Stopping medication/drinking is self-destructive but not described as a suicide attempt. Focus is on thoughts and intent, not prior acts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die and personal acceptance of suicide confirm **Ideation** (e.g., ""content"" with suicide as ""life's purpose""). Absence of method, plan, preparation, or description of past attempt rules out Behavior/Attempt. Heavy distress and self-harm (drinking/stopping meds) are contextual risk factors but do not override the core classification of active suicidal thoughts without actionable plans.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""drowning yourself"" as a method and explicitly questions its pain level.  
   - Describes drowning as ""the best option for me,"" framing it as ""guaranteed death"" and ""peaceful,"" indicating personal consideration.  
   - Expresses a future intention: ""If I get kicked out [...] I think I might go and do that.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (treating suicide as a solution) and fixation on method details.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" and ""transition to death"" reflect a clear personal desire to die. The writer explicitly links this to their own circumstances (""option for me"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Drowning is specified as a method (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean""). The post also ties the action to a potential trigger (""If I get kicked out""), implying conditional planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **future intention** (""I might go and do that"") contingent on an event (getting kicked out). No past actions are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + specific method (drowning) + conditional plan (""If I get kicked out [...]"") = **Behavior**.  
   - The method is clearly identified, and the post indicates preparation of intent (weighing feasibility/peacefulness).  
   - No past initiated action (ruling out Attempt).

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""life isn't worth living,"" ""the virus has won,"" ""I don't see what there is to live for""), despair (""excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world""), and anhedonia (""I just feel like I am ‘existing'""). 
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""suicide is appropriate now,"" ""I want out,"" ""Death seems a better option."" 
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are mentioned. Phrases like ""call it quits"" and ""accept defeat"" are metaphorical and lack concrete suicidal actions. 
   - Temporal context focuses on current/future despair, not past behaviors.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""suicide is appropriate now"" and ""Death seems a better option."" The author states a personal desire to escape life (""I don't want to live,"" ""I want out"") without negation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or actionable steps. Vague metaphors (""call it quits,"" ""accept defeat"") do not imply a method or imminent plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" explicitly.  
   - Emotional tone is positive/hopeful due to Star Wars news (""reason not to,"" ""all I've ever wanted,"" ""postpone any suicide attempts"").  
   - Refers to *future* suicide attempts (""postpone for the next decade"") but explicitly states they are delayed/avoided due to external motivation (Star Wars).  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, locations, or timelines (beyond vague ""next decade"").  
   - No past actions described (e.g., ""tried,"" ""attempted"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts"" (Yes).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No method, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - ""Postpone any suicide attempts"" implies hypothetical future actions but lacks specificity or imminence (""decade"" is distant/non-imminent).

   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""end it all"" implies suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include profound hopelessness, worthlessness, and exhaustion with life.
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past actions described. Focus is on current emotional state and desire to escape life.
   - Writer's desire: Explicitly states a wish to end life (""I just want to end it all"") without negation or indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""End it all"" is a direct phrase implying suicide. Strong expressions like ""no will to live"" and ""tired of living"" confirm a genuine desire for life to end. No disclaimers (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"") are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct, explicit statement of suicidal intent.
   - **Yes**: Profound expressions like ""I have no value"" and ""worst of all human beings"" contextualize this as a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, preparations, or imminent actions.  
   - ""Feel like dying"" and ""Just kill me"" express desire but lack actionable intent or means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings (""until now,"" ""back to feeling"").  
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""Just kill me"") rules out *Indicator* (which requires unwanted thoughts or absence of personal desire).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No past/initiated lethal action** described, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - Strong expressions of suicidal desire without actionable elements fit **Ideation**.

No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes extreme distress: severe sleep deprivation (1 hour/night), feelings of persecution (landlord/neighbors conspiring, ""everyone is in on it""), recent MS diagnosis, financial helplessness (""no money to just walk out""), and profound despair (""this is hell,"" ""here to suffer"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations. Phrases like ""I want to leave"" refer to escaping physical circumstances, not life.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I cant take this torture""), paranoia (""everyone secretly laughs""), and exhaustion, but **no expressions of a desire to die or end life**.  
   - **No past/future suicidal actions** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents.  
   - **No expressions** of wanting to die, not be alive, or end life (e.g., ""I hate living"" is absent). Desires focus on escaping the apartment/situation, not existence.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, wanted or unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No descriptions** of past or imminent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or initiated self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress (exhaustion, paranoia, helplessness) but **lacks personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Key phrases (""I want to leave this place,"" ""I have no money to just walk out"") emphasize situational escape, not suicidal intent.  
   - Strong hopelessness alone does not equate to suicidal ideation; here, it is directed at external circumstances.  
   - **Indicator** fits best: distress is evident, but there is no indication of suicidal thoughts, desire, plan, or behavior.

458,"My parents don't love me. I have nobody :). Possible suicide date is in July. Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends. I'll never be a real woman. I don't know why I cling onto ""hope"". I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""Possible suicide date is in July,"" which directly references suicide and a specific timeframe. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope'""), despair, and identity crisis (""I don't even know who I am anymore""). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions. The phrase ""debating it because of my friends"" indicates internal conflict but does not negate the suicidal desire. The timeframe ""in July"" suggests future intention with moderate imminence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide date,"" indicating a clear personal expression of suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the desire to die is implied through the context of despair and the debate about acting on suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""debating it"" does not explicitly state the thoughts are unwanted; it shows consideration with external deterrents (friends), but the underlying desire remains.
   - Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are not described as unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is not mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances described).
   - No explicit preparations are noted (e.g., no mention of notes, means, or goodbyes).
   - However, ""Possible suicide date is in July"" constitutes an intended action with a specific timeframe. This vague reference to action, coupled with explicit suicidal intent and moderate imminence (a defined month), implies a plan or intended behavior, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intention (""in July"") and current ideation, with no description of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of prior attempts). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (""suicide date"") and is not 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of personal desire).
   - It goes beyond 'Ideation' due to the mention of a specific timeframe for action (""in July""), which qualifies as an intended action or plan, however vague. This fits 'Behavior' per the definition: ""mentions a plan to commit suicide... or an intended action.""
   - No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Imminence (""in July"") is not immediate but specific, and intent is high (debating action), resolving any ambiguity in favor of 'Behavior'.

Final classification: 'behavior' due to explicit suicidal intent coupled with an intended action (setting a date).

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly.
   - Emotional indicators include sadness, hopelessness (e.g., ""I will always be a loser who will never make friends""), and distress (""It hurts so much"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or intended action for suicide. Instead, the user explicitly states, ""I will probably never kill myself,"" due to religious reasons, framing suicide as a ""big sin.""
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings.
   - Imminence is negated, as the user rules out acting on thoughts (""I will probably never kill myself"").
   - The writer's stated desire is conflicted: they experience suicidal thoughts but explicitly reject acting on them due to personal beliefs and express hope for improvement (""I can only hope that my life will get better"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - However, the writer clearly states they do not want to act on these thoughts (""I will probably never kill myself"") and provides a reason (religious sin), indicating the thoughts are unwanted. The phrase ""unfortunately"" suggests distress about the thoughts rather than a genuine, unconflicted desire to die. The closing hope for life to improve further supports that the suicidal thoughts are not desired.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned.
   - The explicit rejection of action (""I will probably never kill myself"") rules out any plan or intended behavior. Even with high emotional distress, there is no implication of imminent action or vague references to methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts but no past or recent self-initiated actions. There is no description of an attempt or preparatory act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of suicidal thoughts leans toward 'Ideation,' but the explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted and will not be acted on (due to religious beliefs) strongly aligns with 'Indicator.' The guidelines specify that if suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted or not representing a current personal desire to die, it should be classified as 'Indicator.' Phrases like ""I have suicidal thoughts"" are countered by the negation of action and expression of hope, reducing ambiguity. There is no plan, method, or preparation, so 'Behavior' is not applicable. No past action is described, ruling out 'Attempt.'

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions explicit suicidal intent: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I’m just so tired""), isolation (""No one from my real life""), self-blame (""failing everyone"").  
   - Specific plan/timing: ""on new year's eve.""  
   - Preparations: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one.""  
   - Desire to die: Clear wish to end life tied to a symbolic date (""beautiful downward spiral... amazing way to end it"").  
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: ""ending it all"" is a direct suicide reference.  
   - **Yes**: ""I’m thinking of ending it all"" expresses current personal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **Plan/timing**: Specific date (""new year's eve"").  
   - **Preparation**: Multiple suicide notes created, with emphasis on ""this is the one.""  
   - Method is vague (""ending it all""), but intent + preparations + imminence (date specified) confirm actionable intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes **future intention** (""thinking of... on new year's eve"") and **past preparations** (notes).  
   - No mention of past *initiated* suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). Notes alone are preparation, not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire + specific timing + preparations = **Behavior**.  
   - Past notes indicate recurring planning but no described *initiated lethal action* (which would be Attempt).  
   - Vague method (""ending it all"") is offset by high imminence (date) and concrete preparations (notes).  
   - Rules: ""Attempt"" requires past initiated action (absent here). ""Ideation"" is ruled out by plan/preparations.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post describes a past action (""tried to cut myself last night"") initiated during a breakdown. It includes emotional distress indicators (""very bad night,"" ""wanted to feel something real"") and context (being drunk, impulsive behavior). There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm with suicidal intent; instead, the action is framed as a response to emotional numbness. The phrase ""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"" emphasizes the unwanted and non-habitual nature of the act. Timeframe is specific (""last night""), but the action is past, not current or future-oriented. The writer's stated desire is to ""feel something real,"" not to die or end life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). The self-harm (cutting) is described as a means to cope with emotional pain (""wanted to feel something real""), not as an expression of suicidal intent. The writer explicitly states they never wanted to self-harm before, framing the act as impulsive and unwanted. Thus, there is no personal, current desire to die expressed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (cutting) is mentioned, but it is tied to the past action and not presented as part of a suicidal plan or future intention. There is no indication of planning (e.g., acquiring means, choosing a location) for suicide, and no reference to imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") regarding suicidal behavior. The context shows the act was impulsive and isolated, without suicidal method or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event (""last night""): a specific self-initiated action (cutting) that occurred during a breakdown. However, the action is not described as potentially lethal or suicidal; it is attributed to wanting to ""feel something real,"" which aligns more with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) than a suicide attempt. There is no mention of lethal intent, outcome (e.g., medical intervention), or connection to suicidal ideation. The focus is on disclosure to a friend, not on recurring or current risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post lacks any expression of suicidal desire, ideation, plan, or preparation. The self-harm is explicitly unwanted and contextualized as a distress response, not a suicidal act. This fits 'Indicator', which covers general distress and non-suicidal self-injury without personal suicidal intent. It does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (no desire to die), 'Behavior' (no suicidal plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no description of a past potentially lethal suicidal action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""plan to kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide and an intention to act.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""i have nothing and no one,"" ""no purpose to live,"" ""do i see a purpose of living""), which stem from a relationship loss and feelings of worthlessness.
   - There is a stated plan (""plan to kill myself"") but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.
   - The post refers to a future intention with the word ""plan,"" but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is provided, so imminence is not clearly high.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die, as seen in ""plan to kill myself"" and the rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't i?,"" which suggests consideration of action without negation of the desire. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates personal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, the desire to die is clear and personal (e.g., ""plan to kill myself,"" questioning why not to do it, and expressing no purpose to live). Phrases like ""no purpose to live"" strongly imply a wish for life to end in the context of despair.
   - There is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not want to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). Instead, the rhetorical question reinforces consideration of action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned; ""kill myself"" is vague.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) are described.
   - Despite the explicit desire to die, the vagueness of ""plan to kill myself"" and lack of high imminence (no immediate timeframe) mean that it does not strongly imply a concrete method or action. The word ""plan"" indicates an intended action, but without specificity, it remains ambiguous after context consideration.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""plan to kill myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no references to past attempts or self-harm). It is focused on current feelings and future plans.
   - There is no description of a past potentially lethal action by the author, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""plan to kill myself,"" expressions of no purpose to live) rules out 'Indicator', as there is no ambiguity about unwanted thoughts or lack of personal intent.
   - The presence of an intended action (""plan to kill myself"") suggests 'Behavior', but the vagueness of the plan and lack of method/preparation or high imminence create uncertainty. After careful consideration, the phrase ""plan to kill myself"" is interpreted as an intended action, which aligns with 'Behavior' (defined as including mentions of a plan or intended action, even if vague). However, if this were less explicit (e.g., ""I want to die""), it might be 'Ideation'. Given the direct statement of intent to act, 'Behavior' is more appropriate.
   - 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no past action is described.
   - Final decision: 'Behavior' due to the explicit mention of a plan/intended action, despite vagueness.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself soon,"" which directly references suicide and implies an imminent action. It discusses whether to inform others about the suicide, indicating practical planning for the act. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"") and a resigned, pragmatic tone focused on the impact on others. No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is detailed, but the phrase ""the process"" and the consideration of timing (""surprise em"" vs. ""heads up"") suggest operational planning. The context is future-oriented (""you'll be killing yourself soon""), with high imminence implied by ""soon."" The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""killing yourself,"" which is a direct phrase equivalent to ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" It expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""killing yourself soon"" and the overall context of planning the act), with no negation of this desire (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to act on this""). Phrases like ""I have no worries of being stopped"" reinforce commitment to the act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tool, substance, location) is mentioned. However, there is an intended action implied by the high imminence (""soon"") and the explicit desire to die. The writer is considering logistical details (""let folks know"" vs. ""surprise em""), which, in context, constitutes preparation or planning for the suicide. The vagueness of ""the process"" is offset by the strong intent and imminence, aligning with the criterion for 'Behavior' when an intended action is present, even if the method isn't specified.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""you'll be killing yourself soon"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). It focuses solely on prospective planning, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal intent and desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts). It goes beyond 'Ideation' because, despite the lack of a specific method, the high imminence (""soon"") and the consideration of how to handle the announcement indicate an intended action and preparation, fitting 'Behavior.' 'Attempt' is not applicable as no past action is described. The ambiguity in method is resolved by the strong intent and operational planning context, leaning toward 'Behavior.'

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself tonight"" and ""want to kill myself so bad,"" indicating a strong desire for suicide. It specifies a method (""hang myself"") and a location (""at the woods""). Emotional indicators include ""I'm so fucking tired of everything,"" expressing despair and hopelessness. There is no mention of past actions; the focus is on imminent future intent (""tonight""). The phrase ""I'll play my favorite music ever"" may imply preparation. The desire to die is personal and not negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""want to kill myself so bad,"" indicating a clear, current, personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not desired (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""hang myself""), along with a location (""at the woods""). The mention of playing favorite music could be interpreted as part of the plan or preparation. Imminence is high (""tonight""). Coupled with the explicit desire, this indicates planning and intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no reference to past initiated actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). It is focused on imminent behavior, not a historical event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a specific method (hanging), location (woods), and preparation (music) with high imminence elevates this beyond 'Ideation'. Since no past or recent initiated action is described, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent, specific plan/method, and imminent action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense loneliness and hopelessness (""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily with loneliness,"" ""What a joke""). It explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""I want to kill myself,"" a specific timeframe (""set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching""), and preparations (""started to cancel friendships""). There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or past suicidal actions initiated by the author. The desire to die is personal and current, with high imminence indicated by ""approaching"" the set date.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""). The language (""I want to kill myself"") shows a genuine personal desire to die, not just distress about thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A plan is mentioned (""set a date 2 weeks ago"") with high imminence (""I'm approaching""). Preparations are described (""started to cancel friendships""), which aligns with suicide planning behaviors. Although no specific method (e.g., tools or location) is detailed, the combination of explicit desire, a set date, and preparatory actions implies an intended action. Given the high intent and imminence, this qualifies as evidence of behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""set a date,"" ""approaching"") and current preparations. There is no description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"" or ""I attempted""). References to past struggles (e.g., ""tried to find solace"") relate to coping, not suicidal actions, so no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal intent). The presence of a plan (set date) and preparations (canceling friendships) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method/action). With no past initiated lethal action described, 'Attempt' does not apply. The high imminence and preparatory actions confirm 'Behavior'.

Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" directly. It expresses hopelessness (""This life doesnt fit me. It never did,"" ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it"") and describes behaviors to avoid acting on suicidal thoughts (""i have to [waste time] so i dont kill myself""). It ends with a philosophical question about suicide (""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death""), which reflects contemplation but not a clear intent. There is no mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. No timeframe or imminence is indicated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - Stated desire: The author explicitly states they engage in behaviors (wasting time) to prevent self-harm, indicating the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and resisted. The question about suicide suggests ambivalence or curiosity, not a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide.""
   - However, the phrase ""i have to [waste time] so i dont kill myself"" clearly negates the desire to act on these thoughts, framing them as distressing but unwanted. The question ""Is suicide really as bad..."" is rhetorical and does not express a personal, current desire to die. Thus, the suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated as something to be avoided, not desired.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The references to suicide are general and abstract (e.g., ""kill myself"" without details, ""suicide"" in a questioning context). There is no indication of planning, intended action, or imminence.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). The focus is on preventing potential future action through avoidance behaviors, not on recounting a past event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and unwanted suicidal thoughts, with explicit negation of the desire to act (e.g., ""so i dont kill myself""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition, which includes mentions of suicidal thoughts only if they are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' because, while suicidal thoughts are present, the author clearly states they do not want to act on them, and there is no profound expression of a genuine desire to die (e.g., phrases like ""I hate living"" are not used; instead, life dissatisfaction is coupled with resistance to suicide).
   - No elements of plan, method, or preparation, so 'Behavior' does not apply.
   - No description of past or recent initiated actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit unwanted nature of the thoughts and lack of desire, intent, or action, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post repeatedly states ""I want to die,"" expressing a direct desire for death. It mentions ""too much of a coward to do it,"" implying an obstacle to acting on suicidal thoughts but not negating the desire itself. There are no references to specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and self-criticism (""coward""), but no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or actionable details. The core is a current, personal wish to die with an expressed barrier to action.

   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" indicating a clear, personal desire to die or for life to end. The phrase ""to do it"" contextually refers to suicide, reinforcing suicidal intent. The barrier (""too much of a coward"") does not explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted or that there is no desire to die; it only addresses an inability to act. Thus, this is not a case of explicitly unwanted thoughts (which would lean toward 'Indicator').

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation, or intended action is mentioned. The reference to ""do it"" is vague and not coupled with any details, imminence, or context implying a plan. Without these elements, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""want to die"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). It focuses on present ideation and inaction, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expression ""I want to die"" qualifies as suicidal ideation, as it conveys a personal desire to die without any plan, method, or preparation. The self-described barrier (""coward"") indicates distress but does not negate the underlying desire or reclassify it as 'Indicator' (which requires explicitly unwanted thoughts or lack of personal suicidal intent). There is no ambiguity suggesting 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no past action). Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

468,"Goodbye. This is probably going to become a throw-away account, possibly my last vent before i littitimatly decide to throw myself off a bridge. I cant take it, ive been suicidal since i was 9, i understood it, i self-harmed. i fifnt want to be here because i hated myself and i was tired of everything around me. But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last. Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide method: ""throw myself off a bridge.""  
   - Strong emotional despair: ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself,"" ""tired of everything.""  
   - Preparation/plan: ""Ive planned it all out,"" isolating in the bathroom, framing the post as a potential ""last vent.""  
   - Imminence: Locked in the bathroom, treating interactions as potentially ""my last.""  
   - Desire to die: ""This is just a way of dying"" indicates acceptance of death. No negation of suicidal desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""throw myself off a bridge"" is a direct method reference.  
   - **Yes**: ""Ive planned it all out"" and ""a way of dying"" confirm active desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: ""bridge"" mentioned.  
   - **Preparation**: Isolation, framing the post as a final message, and ""planned it all out.""  
   - **Imminence**: Context (locked in bathroom, treating texts as last interactions) suggests immediacy.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future** intention (""before I... decide to throw myself,"" ""this is just a way of dying"").  
   - **No past initiated action** described—only history of ideation/self-harm (""suicidal since 9"") but no stated past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (bridge) + preparation (""planned it all out"") = **Behavior**.  
   - Not **Attempt**: No description of a past/ongoing self-initiated lethal action.  
   - Not **Indicator/Ideation**: Unambiguous desire to die with a concrete plan/method.

469,I'm gonna twist my dick off. I'm gonna commit suicide. I can't get a boner but I sure am gonna try here . I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and describes a method: ""twist my dick off"" to cause self-harm, with the intention to ""die of blood loss."" Emotional indicators include frustration (""I can't get a boner"") and a clear intent to act. There are no references to past actions; all statements are future-oriented with high imminence (e.g., ""gonna,"" ""try here,"" ""wait it off and die""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss,"" showing a clear, personal desire to die. There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""twist my dick off"" as a means to cause fatal blood loss. The phrase ""gonna wait it off and die of blood loss"" implies a plan to carry out the action and endure the consequences. Coupled with high imminence (""gonna,"" ""try here""), this indicates intended action. This supports 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions only (e.g., ""I'm gonna,"" ""gonna wait""), with no mention of past initiated actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I attempted""). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply, as it requires a description of a past or very recent self-initiated lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit desire to die (""commit suicide"") and a specific method/plan (""twist my dick off"" to ""die of blood loss""), meeting the criteria for 'Behavior'. There is no ambiguity: the method is described, and imminence is high. It is not 'Ideation' because a plan/method is present, and not 'Attempt' because no past action is described. The focus is solely on the writer's current/future intentions.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes ""Sayonara"" (a farewell term), references to worsening disease, physical pain, mental depression, loneliness, and ""no reason to live."" It explicitly mentions death (""I will eventually die in a much painful way"") but frames it as a future outcome of illness, not self-inflicted. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no reason to live""), despair, and chronic suffering. There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions initiated by the author. The focus is on enduring suffering and anticipating death from natural causes.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent direct phrases. The desire expressed (""I will eventually die"") is tied to disease progression, not a personal wish to end life. Phrases like ""no reason to live"" suggest hopelessness but lack a clear, current expression of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The sentiment is passive acceptance of an inevitable death from illness, not active ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No indication of a plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm. Death is framed as a natural consequence of disease, not an intended action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes ongoing suffering (""endured for years"") and a future death from illness. No past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses profound distress, hopelessness, and acceptance of death due to illness but lacks a personal desire for suicide, plan, or action. Phrases like ""no reason to live"" are concerning but fall short of explicit suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""). Without a clear expression of suicidal intent, method, or past attempt, this aligns with **Indicator**. The core sentiment is distress about an unavoidable fate, not an active wish to end life.

471,"I'm starting to get envious when I hear about people dying/committing suicide successfully. Obviously no one should go through the grief of a loved one dying. I know it is wrong and disgusting to think about yourself when someone is in pain and someone's life. But I just couldn't help but think ""Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"" and the ever so disappointing question of ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" to which the answer is always no. This is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop. I won't like start being healthy or chasing serotonin or whatever, I'll just try to be more considerate next time. I'll still be suicidal lol",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses envy of people who die or commit suicide, with thoughts like ""Why can't that be me?"" and ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" It explicitly states ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include guilt (""wrong and disgusting""), self-criticism (""turning me into a bad person""), and hopelessness (dismissing self-improvement like ""I won't like start being healthy""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or locations. No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings. Imminence is not indicated, as there is no reference to timing (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is expressed through envy and suicidal ideation, but the writer also expresses a need to stop these thoughts, showing some ambivalence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide"" and ""killing yourself,"" and states ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" which directly indicates personal suicidal thoughts.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive through phrases like ""Why can't that be me?"" and the rhetorical question about suicide not being hard, implying a wish for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted in a way that negates personal desire. While the writer calls the thoughts ""wrong and disgusting"" and says ""I need to stop,"" they also affirm the ongoing nature with ""I'll still be suicidal lol,"" suggesting the desire is genuine and not rejected. Therefore, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present.
   - No intended action or plan is described; the content is focused on thoughts and envy. Despite expressions of desire, there is no indication of imminence or context implying a method. Thus, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and feelings (e.g., envy, ongoing suicidality), with no mention of past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, such as ""I tried to overdose""). The references to others' deaths are not personal actions. Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""Why can't that be me?"" and ""I'll still be suicidal""), placing it beyond 'Indicator', which requires the absence of such desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts.
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The core content is expressions of suicidal thoughts and a wish to die without actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'. Ambivalence (e.g., guilt) does not negate the expressed desire.

472,"Idk how to word this without sounding dumb. Am I the only one who wants to die but is still afraid of stupid little things like going to hell or something? Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""wants to die"" explicitly, indicating a personal desire for death. It discusses fears (e.g., going to hell) that prevent action, along with feelings of isolation, guilt (""done some bad shit""), and hopelessness. No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. References to past actions (""done some bad shit"") are vague and not related to suicidal behavior; they appear to be about general life mistakes, not initiated self-harm. The desire to die is current and personal, but the writer expresses it as conflicted due to fear, not as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""wants to die."" This is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent. While fear of hell is a barrier, the writer does not state that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don't want these thoughts""). Instead, the desire is genuine but restrained, so it does not fit the 'Indicator' category.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, preparation (e.g., note-writing), or intended action is mentioned or implied. The discussion centers on internal conflict and fear, with no reference to how suicide might be carried out. Even with the expressed desire, there is no indication of imminence or steps toward action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past actions. References to ""done some bad shit"" are unrelated to suicide attempts and lack any description of initiated self-harm. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit personal desire to die (""wants to die""), fitting 'Ideation'. There is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted (the fear is a barrier, not a rejection of the desire), so it is not 'Indicator'. No past suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is inapplicable. The presence of emotional distress and isolation supports the ideation but does not change the category.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""crushed by stress,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety,"" ""no motivation""), despair (""cried myself to sleep""), isolation (""no friends,"" friend became distant), and feeling unheard (""they will brush it off"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).  
   - The suicidal thoughts are **past-focused** (""for the past 2 years,"" ""during the pandemic"") and countered by a protective factor (little brother). Current distress is emphasized, but **no imminent intent or future action** is stated (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - The writer explicitly states the thoughts were deterred by their brother (""I always thought of my little brother... he is the only reason I’m alive""), indicating **distress about the thoughts** rather than a current active desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""killing myself"" is explicitly mentioned.  
   - However, the context shows **no current desire to act**—the thoughts are framed as past and actively resisted due to love for their brother. Phrases like ""I don’t know how long I can cope"" express overwhelm, not a wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No method, tools, location, or preparations are referenced. The post describes thoughts only, not plans or actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly **past** (""thought of killing myself multiple times"" during a prior period).  
   - **No description of past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present, but they are **unwanted** (actively countered by the brother) and **lack plan/method/action**.  
   - Current language expresses distress and hopelessness but **no personal desire to die** (e.g., ""I need help"" implies seeking survival).  
   - Strong emotional distress and past suicidal thoughts fit **Indicator** when the desire is negated or unwanted. Here, the brother acts as a clear deterrent, confirming the thoughts do not reflect a current wish to die.  
   - Rules: ""I hate living"" is absent; phrases like ""I can’t cope"" are distress signals, not ideation.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions death/dying with phrases like ""how to die"" and ""I just want to definitely die,"" indicating a direct focus on self-inflicted death.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as seen in ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both,"" showing a disregard for consequences due to intense distress.
   - There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) described. The user is asking for information on ""how to die,"" which implies seeking methods but does not state or imply a concrete plan or action.
   - No references to past actions, timeframes, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") are present.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""die"" in a context of personal desire (""I just want to definitely die""), which strongly implies suicidal intent. While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" isn't used, ""die"" here is unequivocally self-referential and expresses a wish for life to end.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., gathering means) is mentioned. The query ""Where can I find out how to die"" indicates an intention to seek information, which could be a preliminary step but is vague and not an explicit plan, method, or immediate preparation. Without high imminence or concrete details, this does not constitute a plan or action under the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses a current/future intention (seeking information on dying) but does not describe any past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of personal intent).
   - However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or intended action (e.g., the information-seeking is too vague to qualify as preparation like ""getting a rope""). With no high imminence and ambiguity about a concrete plan, this aligns with 'Ideation'.
   - 'Behavior' is not applicable due to the absence of any stated or implied plan/method.
   - 'Attempt' is irrelevant as no past action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""will to die,"" ""if I do attempt again,"" ""if I do it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""don't want a future""), exhaustion (""tired of fighting""), indifference toward loved ones, PTSD diagnosis.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: ""I've made enough plans"" (context implies suicide plans), ""if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail"" (implies method confidence).  
   - Past actions: Explicit reference to ""attempt again"" (past suicide attempt).  
   - Imminence: ""not in immediate danger,"" ""at least a few months out.""  
   - Desire: Explicit desire not to be alive (""not because I want to be alive,"" ""will to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" but ""will to die"" and ""if I do it"" imply intent. Desire to die is clear and not negated as unwanted. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - ""I've made enough plans"" (contextualized with suicide timeline) and confidence in succeeding ""if I attempt again"" imply method/plan. → **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Explicitly references a past self-initiated action: ""if I do attempt again"" confirms a prior suicide attempt by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past attempt (""attempt again"") is clearly described and linked to current feelings. Rules state **'Attempt' takes precedence** if a past initiated action is mentioned, regardless of historical timing. Current planning/ideation is present but does not override the confirmed past attempt.

477,"Does inpatient care help?. Did anyone having thoughts of suicide benefit from inpatient care? Do they start you on medication to help regulate your brain chem and moderate the progress?.

It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" in the context of a question about inpatient care, but this is not a personal expression from the author; it's an abstract reference.
   - Emotional indicators include distress about life circumstances (e.g., feeling unable to concentrate, perceiving others as focused on careers, and struggling with self-worth due to past failures). The author explicitly states, ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live,"" indicating a desire to overcome these feelings and seek positive steps.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no timeframes like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" for suicidal intent).
   - The author's stated desire is focused on living and finding help, not on dying or ending life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""thoughts of suicide"" is used, but it is framed as a general question (""Did anyone having thoughts...""), not as a personal admission. The author does not directly state ""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself,"" or similar.
   - Expressions like ""convincing myself I deserve to live"" and ""trying to find the courage to actually live"" explicitly negate a desire to die, instead showing distress about unwanted feelings and a struggle to affirm life.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not personally claimed and the desire to live is emphasized, there is no clear, current personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described.
   - No vague references to action (e.g., ""do something"") are present that could imply imminent behavior, especially given the lack of suicidal desire.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and seeks advice for the future, but it does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions by the author (e.g., no references to attempts, even historical ones).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness, but it lacks a personal expression of desire to die. Instead, the author actively seeks ways to live and manage their struggles.
   - Mentions of suicide are abstract (in a question about others) and implicitly unwanted, as the author's efforts are directed toward living. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress about life without suicidal intent or unwanted suicidal thoughts.
   - There is no evidence of suicidal ideation (e.g., no personal wish to die), behavior (e.g., no plan or method), or attempt (e.g., no past actions).
   - In cases of ambiguity between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', 'Indicator' is chosen when suicidal desire is negated or not personally expressed, as here.

478,Another day of being mute. Three hours of lying in bed while bf plays video games in the other room. Everyday is the same. Today I get to wear ugly clothes my mom didn't want and meet my bfs friend for drinks. Nothing to say ever. Graying hair always pulled back. I'm 40 and unemployed. I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge."" This indicates a direct reference to suicide, with a specific method implied by ""Bridge"" (suggesting jumping from a bridge). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Everyday is the same,"" ""No future""), worthlessness (""I'm 40 and unemployed""), and despair (""Can't sleep"").
   - A specific plan is mentioned: ""on Monday,"" indicating imminence. The method ""Bridge"" is clearly stated.
   - No references to past suicide actions (e.g., no description of an initiated attempt). The focus is on future intent.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""kill myself""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, there is a clear desire to die: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" expresses personal intent.
   - No, there is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon; the language shows commitment.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""Bridge,"" implying a plan to jump.
   - The timeframe ""on Monday"" indicates a plan with high imminence.
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., writing a note) are described, but the combination of method and plan is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""going to try and kill myself on Monday""), not a past event. There is no mention of any initiated action by the author (e.g., no reference to a prior attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - The presence of a specific method (""Bridge"") and plan (""on Monday"") elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which involves thoughts without a plan/method).
   - No past initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The combination of suicidal intent, method, and plan fits 'Behavior'.

479,Set my wallpaper to hangman's noose just to stay on track. Tried to sleep but then changed the wallpaper. Recently overcame a big hurdle to kms. Now I'm sure my mom won't be on the street when I do it. And it's just can't get this girl out of my head. Good fore to stay away though. Not cool to start something and then  just kms. Gah but it's so hard. One of the hardest decisions I've taken iny life. Wish I have more sex before I go though lol. Being non religious in a religious country is HARDDD too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""kms"" (kill myself) appears twice, ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper (specific method reference).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""it's so hard,"" ""one of the hardest decisions,"" frustration about relationships/religion.  
   - Plan/method/preparation: ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper (method symbol), ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" (preparatory action), ensuring ""mom won't be on the street"" (logistical planning for suicide).  
   - Past actions: ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" implies recent preparation. No described *initiated* lethal action.  
   - Imminence: No explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but ongoing intent implied by wallpaper and planning.  
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die via ""kms"" and planning; no negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""kms"" (direct phrase), overcoming hurdles for suicide, and planning contextually imply genuine desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes: ""hangman's noose"" is a specific method symbol. ""Overcame a big hurdle to kms"" and ensuring mother’s welfare are preparatory steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes recent preparations (""overcame hurdle,"" wallpaper changes) and future intention (""when I do it""). No mention of a *past initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""kms"") + specific method (noose) + preparations (hurdle overcome, mother’s situation) = **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action (e.g., ""took pills"") rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Unwanted thoughts are absent; desire is affirmed. Preparations confirm progression beyond 'Ideation'.

480,I want to die. I wanna stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain. my mind always feels like clutter and I don't know what's wrong with me. I can never get sleep or think straight. yet i've only been diagnosed with depression. I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born. I stick out but not in a good way. I don't know how to undo the mess i've done with my life. I haven't been happy in 2 years now. it just seems like my adulthood is all downhill from here. I don't have any passions or desires i'm not good at anything. I can't even have a normal high schooler job without feeling so much anxiety that I have to quit because I couldn't stop crying. i'm a failure. I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I want to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""adulthood is all downhill,"" ""I’m a failure""), despair (""I haven’t been happy in 2 years""), self-loathing (""I don’t want to be me anymore""), and anxiety.  
   - **Crucial negation**: ""I don’t want to die but I don’t want to be me anymore"" explicitly rejects the desire to die despite initial phrasing.  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. Focus is on emotional pain and distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrase (""I want to die"") is present but **immediately negated** by the author (""I don’t want to die""). The core sentiment is distress about existence, not a genuine wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - None. Only abstract distress about identity/pain.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past/current suicidal actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - ""I want to die"" initially suggests Ideation, but the explicit negation (""I don’t want to die"") clarifies this as **distress about unwanted feelings**, not active suicidal desire.  
   - Lack of plan/method/action rules out Behavior/Attempt.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses suicidal thoughts as *unwanted* (""I don’t want to die"") alongside general distress.

481,"Can't take it anymore. I'm a 20 year old with a son, I have no college degree but I did graduate high school. I feel like I failed my son already, I've been working dead end jobs for the past year so I can support him and his mom.

I've been thinking about just getting it over with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes expressions of hopelessness (""I feel like I failed my son already,"" ""I'm worthless as fuck""), burden (""I feel like he'll be better off without me""), and direct suicidal ideation (""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"").
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, or acquiring means).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present.
   - The phrase ""getting it over with"" is a common euphemism for suicide but lacks specificity on method, plan, or imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - The emotional context centers on despair and self-loathing, with a stated desire for life to end to relieve burden on others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""getting it over with"" strongly implies a personal desire to die in this context.
   - Expressions like ""he'll be better off without me"" indicate a genuine wish for life to end to benefit others.
   - There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied (e.g., no tools, substances, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - The phrase ""getting it over with"" is vague and does not indicate an intended action with imminence; it is framed as ongoing thoughts (""I've been thinking about"").
   - Without any plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"").
   - All content is focused on present ideation, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The key phrase ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with"" confirms explicit personal suicidal ideation, as it expresses a desire for life to end without ambiguity or negation.
   - Strong emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, burden) support this, but the absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not escalate to 'Behavior'.
   - 'Indicator' is ruled out because there is a clear personal desire to die, not just general distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - 'Attempt' is not relevant as no past actions are described.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the presence of suicidal thoughts/desire without actionable elements.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post details multiple instances of suicidal actions and preparations: at age 15 (aspirin overdose), age 21 (gun incident), recently (hanging attempt), and today (exit bag with gas initiation). Specific methods (pills, gun, hanging, exit bag) and preparations (purchasing tools, researching, setting up the exit bag) are explicitly mentioned.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""lifelong depression,"" ""depersonalization,"" ""so empty""), despair (""fought with this for a long time,"" ""felt despair over my desire to die""), loneliness, and exhaustion.
   - The author references past actions with timeframes (""at 15,"" ""at 21,"" ""recently,"" ""today"") and describes initiating each method, though all were interrupted or failed.
   - Imminence is present in the exit bag incident (""Today,"" ""I turned that gas valve""), where action was initiated but stopped due to panic.
   - The desire to die is genuine and personal (""desire to die,"" ""suicide has scared me,"" ""this method is surefire""), with conflict about fear of pain/failure but no explicit statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide,"" ""suicide note,"" and ""desire to die,"" indicating a personal wish to end life. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods are detailed (aspirin overdose, gun, hanging, exit bag), along with preparations (purchasing items, research, setting up the exit bag). The author initiated actions for each method, including turning on the gas for the exit bag today.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes multiple past initiated actions: overdose at 15 (resulting in hospitalization), gun incident at 21 (trigger pulled but malfunctioned), hanging attempt recently (physical effects noted), and gas initiation today (turned on but stopped). All are specific, potentially lethal, and self-initiated by the author. The historical attempts are mentioned in the context of current struggles, and the gas incident is a very recent initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - 'Attempt' is appropriate because the author describes past and very recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (overdose, gun, hanging, gas initiation). These actions were interrupted or failed but meet the definition of Attempt. The presence of current ideation or behavior (e.g., having the exit bag set up) does not override this, as Attempt takes precedence when initiated actions are described. The historical nature of some attempts does not disqualify them, as they are linked to the author's current state.
   - This is not 'Indicator' because suicidal desire is explicit and not unwanted. It is not 'Ideation' because there is evidence of actions beyond thoughts. It is not 'Behavior' because the post goes beyond plans/preparations to describe initiated actions.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end my life"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile""), self-loathing (""I'm a garbage person,"" ""I'm just a leech""), and feeling like a burden (""for the benefit of those around me""). There are no specific methods, plans, preparations, or timeframes (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent actions like ""tonight""). No past suicidal actions are described. The desire to end life is presented as a personal belief (""should just end my life"") without explicit negation (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide. It expresses a clear personal desire to die for perceived benefits (e.g., ""for my benefit and the benefit of those around me""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., nothing like pills, a gun, or writing a note). The reference to ending life is vague and lacks imminence or concrete action, so it does not imply a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""should just end my life""), aligning with 'Ideation'. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The lack of explicit unwanted thoughts or ambiguity about suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator' (phrases like ""should just end my life"" indicate genuine desire). No past action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""kill myself"" directly states suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""don't see a reason to live"" (hopelessness) and ""Life sucks"" (despair).  
   - Imminence: ""about to"" indicates immediate intent.  
   - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" (Yes).  
   - Clear desire to die: ""don't see a reason to live"" reinforces intent (Yes).  
   - No statement that thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note) mentioned.  
   - However, ""about to"" implies imminent action, and ""kill myself"" implies a vague method tied to high imminence. This leans toward Behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intention (""about to""), not a past action. No reference to prior attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation base) + high imminence (""about to"") implies intended action. Even without specific method details, the combination of intent and immediacy qualifies as **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""face death,"" ""working out until i die or pass out,"" and implies potential death with ""if not, well, you know what happened."" Emotional indicators include anger (""I'm too pissed""), hopelessness (""don't even want to feel good anymore""), and acceptance of pain (""embrace the pain""). There is a specific plan: starting to work out excessively with the intent to cause harm, potentially leading to death. Preparations are not mentioned, but the action is initiated immediately (""now gonna start""). Timeframe is imminent (""now,"" ""in 12 hours""). The writer's desire is to face death, indicating a wish for life to end rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it expresses a clear desire to die through ""face death"" and the context of working out until death. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the writer embraces the pain and risks death. This leans towards suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is an intended action that could be lethal due to extreme physical exertion. The method is vague but coupled with high imminence (""now"") and clear intent to harm oneself. Preparations are implied by the immediate initiation of the action. This points to Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""gonna start"") with a 12-hour outcome window. It does not describe a past initiated action (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt). The focus is on current/future behavior, not a historical event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""face death""), moving it beyond Indicator (which requires unwanted thoughts or no personal intent). It includes a plan/method (excessive working out with lethal intent) and imminent action, distinguishing it from Ideation (which lacks plan/action). As the action is future-oriented and not a past initiated event, it is Behavior, not Attempt. The high imminence and specificity of the method in context confirm Behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it.""  
   - Desire to die: Clear expression of intent (""I know I am going to do it"") and future timeframe (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness about retirement planning due to suicidal plans.  
   - Plan/method: None specified—no tools, locations, substances, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Action/timeline: Future-oriented (""want to experience a few more things""), no past actions described.  
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""I know I am going to do it"") without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""contemplated suicide"" and ""I know I am going to do it.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a genuine desire to die (""I know I am going to do it"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method**: Only a vague future intention (""in my 20's or 30's"") and no details about means, location, or preparations.  
   - **No preparation**: Focuses on retirement savings conflict, not acquiring tools or acting soon.  
   - **Imminence**: Low—defers action to an uncertain future (""maybe in my 20's or 30's"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intentions**, not past actions. No mention of initiated attempts (e.g., ""tried,"" ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong explicit desire to die (""I know I am going to do it"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned—only a general timeline. Vague timing (""20's or 30's"") and lack of actionable steps lean toward 'Ideation'.  
   - **Attempt**: Not applicable—no past/initiated actions described.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post asks, ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" which is an inquiry about the lethality of a medication (duloxetine, an antidepressant). It then states, ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later,"" indicating possession of the pills and an intention to use them at an unspecified future time.
   - There are no explicit emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair, or hating life). The post is factual and lacks expressions of personal distress or desire related to suicide.
   - No specific plans, methods (beyond the general mention of pills), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or references to past actions are described.
   - Imminence is low, as ""saving for later"" suggests no immediate action.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous; there is no explicit wish to die, for life to end, or for unwanted suicidal thoughts. The focus is on the drug's potential and possession.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of whether they are unwanted or not.
   - Without explicit personal suicidal desire or intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Duloxetine pills are mentioned as a potential method, but this is in the form of a question about lethality, not a statement of personal intent to use them for self-harm.
   - Possession of pills (""I have a few pills"") and saving them ""for later"" could imply preparation, but it is vague and not explicitly linked to a suicidal plan. The reason for saving is unspecified (e.g., it could be for legitimate medical use or other purposes).
   - Since there is no explicit desire to die (from step 2), even with possession of means, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. Method and preparation are not clearly tied to suicidal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past events, such as a previous suicide attempt or initiated action.
   - The post discusses a future possibility (""saving for later"") but with low imminence and no indication of action being taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""), so it does not qualify as 'Ideation'.
   - Without explicit suicidal desire, and with ambiguity around the intent behind possessing and saving pills, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires both desire and a plan/method/preparation).
   - No past or recent self-initiated lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The content involves abstract discussion of death (lethality of a drug) and possession of means, but without personal suicidal intent or explicit distress. This fits 'Indicator', which includes abstract mentions of death or means when suicidal desire is not personally expressed or is ambiguous.

   - Key elements: Expression of distress (""hell,"" ""out of place""), hopelessness (""no one cares about my life""), and a direct statement about wanting to end something (""I just want to end but haven't yet"").  
   - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""it isn't me [who cares]""), despair (""Today's a great day. It's hell""), and isolation (""out of place"").  
   - ""I just want to end"" strongly implies a desire for life to cease. ""Haven't yet"" confirms no action taken.  
   - No temporal markers for imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - ""I just want to end"" is a clear expression of desire for life to end, especially in context (""haven't yet""). No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to""). → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations. ""End"" is vague and lacks actionable context. → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings. ""Haven’t yet"" explicitly rules out past/ongoing actions. → **No attempt described**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""want to end"") with no plan/method. Strong hopelessness supports this.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire is personal and not negated/unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent self-initiated lethal actions.

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions death explicitly (""dead by the end of the day today"") and suicidal action (""off myself"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Fatigue is usually considered..."") and self-conflict (""My brain is my body's worst enemy"").  
   - A specific method (""buy the gas"") and imminence (""by the end of the day today"") are stated.  
   - The desire to die is explicit (""I could be dead""), but procrastination/fatigue delays action.  
   - No past initiated actions are described—only hypotheticals and barriers.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""dead by the end of the day"" and ""off myself"" confirm a personal desire to die. Procrastination is framed as a barrier, not a negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A method (""buy the gas"") is explicitly mentioned. Imminence (""end of the day today"") and intent (""if I just put my mind to it"") reinforce this as a current plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past actions (e.g., ""tried to"")—only future intention. Fatigue delays action but doesn’t negate the plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong desire to die + specific method (""gas"") + plan (""if I put my mind to it"") = **Behavior**.  
   - No past initiated lethal action (ruling out Attempt). Unwanted thoughts aren’t stated; fatigue is a practical barrier, not a rejection of intent.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""do it"" in the context of suicide, ""post about suicide constantly,"" and ""suck it up and do it already."" These indicate a personal desire to act on suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include frustration and self-criticism (""stop being a pussy,"" ""suck it up""), suggesting despair and urgency. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or locations. The temporal context is future-oriented with high imminence (""do it already""), implying immediate intent, but no past actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The stated desire is to act on suicidal thoughts, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly referenced through ""post about suicide constantly"" and ""do it"" in context, which clearly means suicide. The phrases ""I should stop being a pussy and do it"" and ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" express a clear, personal desire to die, with no negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""). This aligns with 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to ""do it"" is vague and does not imply a plan, method, or action beyond general intent. Although imminence is high (""do it already""), the vagueness of ""do it"" without context of how, where, or with what means does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. Thus, this points to 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intention (""should... do it"") with urgency but no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). The reference to ""post about suicide constantly"" indicates historical expression of thoughts, not a suicidal action, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""do it"" meaning suicide), so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of personal desire). There is no plan, method, preparation, or specific intended action described, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. The high imminence and intent are noted, but the vagueness of ""do it"" creates genuine uncertainty about a plan or method, leaning toward 'Ideation'. No past initiated action is present, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - **Explicit Suicide/Death Intent:** The post states ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" and ""I plan to hang myself..."" which are direct expressions of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""end it"" and describing preparations confirm a genuine desire to die.
   - **Method/Plan/Preparation:** Specific methods are detailed: ""hang myself"" and ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" Preparations are explicit: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" High imminence is implied by ""now it time to stop the lie and end it.""
   - **Action Assessment:** The post describes a past suicidal plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") but clarifies no action was taken (""But I didn't""). The current plan is future-oriented, not a past initiated action. Self-harm (cutting) is noted but is non-lethal and presented as historical coping, not a suicide attempt.
   - **Emotional State:** Mentions being ""happy"" and ""not sad or depress,"" but this doesn't negate the explicit suicidal intent and planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** Direct phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" ""end it."" Desire is unequivocal and not framed as unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **Yes.** Specific methods (hanging, axe), tools (rope, axe, car), location (forest), and confirmation of readiness (""Everything is ready"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Past plan (January) was not acted upon. Current plan is future-focused with imminent intent (""now it time...""). No description of a past *initiated* lethal action (e.g., no mention of starting hanging or cutting). Self-harm is disclosed but is distinct from a suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** Explicit desire to die is present, coupled with specific plans/methods/preparations. This meets the threshold for 'Behavior'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past or recent initiated lethal action is described (the January plan was not acted on). Current language (""plan to,"" ""Everything is ready"") indicates intent but not completed action.  
   - **Indicator/Ideation:** Not applicable, as suicidal intent is explicit and not unwanted.  
   - **Conclusion:** The post details active planning, method specificity, and preparation without describing a past attempt. This aligns with **Behavior**.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses existential themes about the pointlessness of life and death, with phrases like ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""there still is no point for us being here."" It expresses emotional distress, including hopelessness and a wish to never have been born (""I wish I was never born""). However, it explicitly negates a desire to die with ""but at the same time don't really want to die."" There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The tone is philosophical and reflective, focusing on life's meaning rather than personal suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar direct phrases (e.g., no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all"").
   - While there are expressions of despair (e.g., ""I wish I was never born""), this is not equivalent to a current desire to die, especially as it is directly followed by ""don't really want to die."" The phrase ""life isn't worth it"" is implied but not stated, and the explicit negation of wanting to die indicates any underlying thoughts about death are unwanted and not a genuine expression of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No reference to a plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or intended action. The post remains abstract and philosophical.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of self-initiated potentially lethal behavior).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and existential despair but lacks a clear, personal, current desire to die or suicidal intent. The explicit statement ""don't really want to die"" confirms that any negative thoughts are unwanted and not indicative of ideation. There is no plan, method, or action described, ruling out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'. Ambiguous phrases like ""I wish I was never born"" are outweighed by the direct negation of wanting to die, aligning with 'Indicator'.

So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes feelings of shame, embarrassment, and anxiety due to purchasing a used sex toy, which became known to others, leading to mockery. The author is starting a new school and fears negative first impressions. Emotional indicators include shame (""I am very ashamed""), regret (""I messed up big time""), and fear of judgment (""afraid of what everyone will think of me""). There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. The focus is on seeking advice for a social situation, with no references to suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases.
   - No expression of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I hate living""). The distress is centered on social embarrassment, not existential despair.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no context for unwanted thoughts.
   - Conclusion: No suicidal intent is present, leaning strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of any method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide or self-harm.
   - No implied or vague references to action (e.g., ""make this pain physical"") in the context of suicide.
   - Not applicable, as there is no suicidal desire from Step 2.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past events (buying the item, starting Nofap) and future concerns (starting school), but no description of any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to"" or ""I attempted"" statements).
   - No initiated suicidal actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (shame, fear, embarrassment) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plan, or action.
   - It fits 'Indicator' because: 
     - Distress is present, but there is no ambiguity about suicidal intent—it is entirely absent.
     - No phrases like ""I hate living"" that could imply ideation; instead, the language is about seeking help (""I really need help"") and managing social anxiety.
     - Contrasts with 'Ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts) and higher categories, as there is no evidence of suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.
   - Rules applied: Only the author's risk is considered, and there is no mention of suicide in any form.

Final reasoning: The content is solely about emotional distress from a social mishap, with no suicidal elements. Thus, 'Indicator' is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill yourself"" directly, which refers to suicide. It expresses emotional distress, including feelings of being ""sick of it,"" suffering, and resentment toward family for preventing suicide. There are no specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or references to past actions. The language is general and hypothetical, focusing on frustration rather than imminent plans. The author's desire to die is implied through phrases like ""why do you want me to suffer,"" but there is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" in a personal context (using ""you"" to refer to the author, based on the rule that risk corresponds to the writer). It expresses a clear desire to die to end suffering, as seen in the rhetorical questions about being forced to live. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to ""kill yourself"" is vague and general, with no details on how or when it might occur. There is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The focus is on external prevention, not personal action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and hypothetical scenarios, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, initiated actions, or outcomes like ""I tried yesterday""). The language is present-tense and abstract.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal intent through personal expressions like ""kill yourself"" and a desire to end suffering, placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The core is a desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'. Phrases like ""sick of it"" and ""suffer"" support this as personal ideation without ambiguity about desire.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses loneliness (""am i lonely""), feelings of being uncared for (""nobody fucking cares""), self-deprecation (""Im such a spoiled piece of shit""), and a plea for death (""pls fucking end me before the day""). The phrase ""say im going to do it"" likely implies a reference to suicidal intent or threat, but it's vague and framed as something said to elicit care. There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no notes, means, or plans described). The temporal context includes urgency (""before the day""), but no past actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The desire for death (""end me"") is explicit and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""im going to do it"" in context strongly implies suicidal intent, especially paired with ""pls fucking end me,"" which is a clear expression of a desire to die (e.g., wanting life to end). There is no statement rejecting or disavowing these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so the desire appears genuine. This points away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Do it"" is vague and could refer to suicidal action, but it's not elaborated on, and ""end me"" is a passive plea rather than an active plan by the author. Despite the urgency (""before the day""), there is no indication of how the author would act on the desire, so this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""im going to do it,"" ""end me before the day"") with no description of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, overdoses, or self-harm). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""pls fucking end me""), which qualifies as suicidal ideation. However, there is no mention of a plan, method, intended action, or preparations, ruling out 'Behavior'. The lack of unwanted thoughts negation (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"") and the presence of genuine desire rule out 'Indicator'. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Ambiguity around ""do it"" is resolved in favor of 'Ideation' since no concrete plan or method is evident, and imminence alone isn't sufficient for 'Behavior' without action elements.

Final category: 'Ideation' (explicit desire to die with no plan/method/action).

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Key elements: Mentions death (""hope it'll be me next""), references suicide indirectly (""wouldn't have to bring shame... with a suicide""), and expresses a desire for death to occur passively (via stabbing) to avoid family shame. Emotional indicators include shame and hopelessness (implied by preferring death over life). No specific plan, method, or preparation by the author is described (e.g., no self-initiated action like acquiring tools). The desire is for an *external event* (stabbing) to cause death, not a personal suicide plan. Timeframe is future-oriented (""hope it'll be me next"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Explicit mention of ""suicide""? Yes, but framed as an undesirable outcome due to shame. The phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" explicitly expresses a desire to die. This is a personal wish for life to end, even if passively. Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly negated as unwanted; the focus is on avoiding stigma, not rejecting the desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - No specific method or plan by the author is mentioned. The reference to stabbing is a *hoped-for external event*, not a self-initiated action (e.g., ""I will stab myself"" or ""I will go to a dangerous area to get stabbed""). No preparations (e.g., seeking out locations, writing notes) are described. Desire is coupled with passivity, not intent to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Describes a future wish (""hope it'll be me next""), not a past or current action. No initiated self-harm or suicide attempt is mentioned. The reference to suicide is hypothetical/abstract (avoiding shame), not a description of personal history.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next""), placing this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no genuine desire to die). The passive nature of the wish (relying on external violence) and lack of any plan, method, or preparation by the author rules out *Behavior* (which requires intent/plan) and *Attempt* (which requires past/current action). The core is an expression of suicidal ideation without actionable steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit mention of ""killmyself"" and ""put an end to it all."" 
    - Strong emotional indicators: isolation (""0 friends,"" ""0 social life""), hopelessness (""no skills no job no money""), and burden (""something blocking me... my family""). 
    - Specific method/plan: ""disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty... kill myself with peace... maybe was just an accident."" This includes relocation, identity change, and intent to conceal suicide as an accident. 
    - Imminence: No immediate timeframe, but expresses active planning. 
    - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all"") with no negation of intent. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes: Direct phrases like ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself."" 
    - Yes: Clear desire to die (""put an end to it all""). 
    - No statement of unwanted thoughts; instead, active planning to overcome barriers. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - Method: Disappearing, relocating to another country, changing identity to facilitate suicide covertly. 
    - Preparation: Detailed steps to avoid detection (""no one knowing""), framing death as an accident. 
    - High intent: Plan addresses barriers (family) to enable suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Describes future intentions (""how can I disappear,"" ""go to another country""). 
    - No past initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (✓) + specific plan/preparation (✓) = **Behavior**. 
    - ""Disappearing"" and identity change constitute active planning to execute suicide. 
    - No past actions rule out 'Attempt.' Strong intent and method distinguish from 'Ideation.'

People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a past suicide attempt (""tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"") and describes the method in detail. It expresses a strong desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"", ""Unfortunately, I'm still alive"") and high emotional distress (anger, frustration with ""WHY! WHY! WHY!""). There is also a stated future intention (""gonna try again tonight"") with a specific plan mentioned (""Plan B"" as a backup, though less detailed). The timeframe for the past action is ""last night"" (very recent), and imminence for future action is ""tonight."" The writer's desire to die is clear and not unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""tried to kill myself,"" ""ALMOST KILL MYSELF,"" and ""I FUCKING WANTED TO"" die. It expresses a genuine personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is described for the past attempt (suffocation with a mask and plastic bag). For the future, there is an explicit plan to act (""gonna try again tonight"") and a reference to ""another plan"" (Plan B), indicating preparation and intent. However, the focus here is on the past action, which is key for categorization.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action: the writer attempted suicide ""last night"" and provides details of the method (suffocation), which was initiated but failed (""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED""). This is a clear, concrete action by the author, mentioned in the context of current distress and future plans. The timeframe (""last night"") is recent, and it is explicitly tied to the writer's current state. This qualifies as an 'Attempt' regardless of the outcome or the presence of future intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The described past suicide attempt takes precedence under the 'Attempt' category definition, as it involves a self-initiated, potentially lethal action. The writer clearly states they ""tried to kill myself,"" which is an initiated behavior, even if it was not fatal. Current expressions of desire to die and future plans (e.g., ""gonna try again tonight"") do not override this, as 'Attempt' is prioritized when a past action is explicitly described. There is no ambiguity here— the post centers on a recent attempt and its aftermath.

I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post describes feeling tired, wanting to sleep constantly, feeling empty, and worrying about damaging friendships due to a depressive episode. There are positive aspects mentioned (rugby team, starting uni, supportive relationships, HRT progress), but the focus is on exhaustion and emotional emptiness.
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (implied by feeling empty and worried about ruining relationships) and anhedonia (lack of energy/motivation, e.g., not wanting to get out of bed). However, these are framed in the context of depression, not a desire to die.
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The phrase ""another depressive episode"" suggests a history of depression but does not indicate past suicide attempts or behaviors.
   - No imminence of harmful intentions; the tone is one of ongoing struggle rather than immediate crisis.
   - The writer expresses distress about depression impacting relationships but shows no stated desire to die. Instead, they acknowledge positive life aspects, suggesting the distress is unwanted but not suicidal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expressions of a desire to die, not be alive, or for life to end (e.g., no phrases like ""I hate living"" or ""I want to die""). Statements like ""I just want to sleep 24/7"" and ""I feel empty"" indicate depressive symptoms but are not equivalent to a wish for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no context for unwanted thoughts.
   - Conclusion: No explicit or implied suicidal intent. The content leans toward 'Indicator' as it reflects general distress without personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide.
   - No vague references to action that could imply a plan (e.g., no statements like ""I need to end this"").
   - Since no suicidal desire was identified in Step 2, this step does not elevate the risk. No evidence of behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (tiredness, emptiness) and worry about a future depressive episode impacting relationships.
   - No description of past suicidal actions (e.g., no references to ""I tried to"" or ""when I attempted""). The mention of ""another depressive episode"" is not tied to any suicidal behavior or attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress (depressive symptoms, relationship worries) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past action. Phrases like ""I feel empty"" and not wanting to get out of bed are consistent with depression but do not cross into suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I hate living"" would be ideation, but that is absent). The acknowledgment of positive life factors further supports that the distress is not accompanied by a wish to die.
   - No ambiguity about suicidal desire: It is not present, so 'Indicator' is appropriate over 'Ideation'.
   - No evidence of plan or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past initiated suicidal actions, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Final category: 'Indicator' (general distress without personal suicidal intent).
