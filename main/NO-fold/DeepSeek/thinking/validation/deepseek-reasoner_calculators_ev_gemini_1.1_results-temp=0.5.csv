0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""ending my life again"" indicating recurring suicidal thoughts.
   - Expresses despair (""everything in my life is crap""), self-loathing (""hate being myself""), and hopelessness about relationships.
   - Explicitly references a specific method (""go to a bridge and jump off"").
   - No indication of past actions (e.g., ""tried to jump""), preparations (e.g., ""went to the bridge""), or interrupted attempts. Temporal context is future-oriented (""want to go"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""ending my life"" and ""jump off."" The desire is personal and current (""I want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""jump off"") and location (""bridge"") are clearly stated. No explicit preparations (e.g., ""going now"") are mentioned, but the plan is concrete.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes future intention (""want to go"") without reference to a past/initiated action. ""Again"" implies recurring thoughts, not a prior attempt (no action described).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/location = **Behavior**. 
   - Distinction from Ideation: Method/plan elevates it beyond mere desire. 
   - Distinction from Attempt: No initiated action described (e.g., ""I went to the bridge yesterday"").

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post contains emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" suggests despair and hopelessness.
   - It mentions death/dying: ""I'm going to die soon"" implies an expectation of death, with ""soon"" indicating imminence.
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or references to past actions are present.
   - The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" could reflect a desire to die in the context of despair, but it does not explicitly state suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - It expresses an expectation of death (""I'm going to die soon"") in a despairing context, which may imply a desire to die, but the language is passive and not explicitly self-directed as a suicidal wish (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""I want to die""). 
   - There is no indication that suicidal thoughts (if present) are unwanted or negated. However, since suicide is not mentioned, the explicit intent is ambiguous.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The statement is vague and lacks actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on a future expectation (""soon"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interventions, or self-harm).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" in a context of despair aligns with the 'Ideation' category per the definition, which includes explicit personal expressions of a desire not to be alive or expectations of death (e.g., ""I'm going to die soon"" in despair). 
   - However, the lack of explicit suicidal terminology (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""want to die"") creates ambiguity. Per the rules, if there is doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, 'Indicator' should be chosen. But the Ideation definition specifically cites ""I'm going to die soon"" in despair as an example of Ideation, overriding the ambiguity rule in this case.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life (""I hate living"") and existential despair (""why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night""). It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness and a sense of meaninglessness. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. The phrase ""sometime i think about"" frames this as a recurring thought rather than an immediate intent. No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. The writer's desire is centered on distress about life circumstances, not a stated wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, death, or phrases like ""kill myself."" The expression ""I hate living"" suggests a desire to not be alive but is indirect and lacks the clarity of a genuine wish to die (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned; instead, the focus is on questioning existence. There is no statement indicating that thoughts of death are unwanted or resisted, but the absence of explicit suicidal language leans this toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The content remains at the level of thoughts and feelings, with no actionable elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current or recurring thoughts (""sometime i think about""), with no reference to past actions or future intentions involving self-harm. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Phrases like ""I hate living"" and questioning life could be ambiguous, but they fall short of explicit suicidal ideation (e.g., ""I want to die""). With no plan, method, or preparation, it does not meet 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' criteria. Given the ambiguity and absence of explicit suicidal desire, this aligns with 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - It includes a specific method: ""barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which are substances known for lethal use in suicide.
   - There is evidence of preparation: The writer is actively seeking help to acquire these drugs (""help me find"").
   - No emotional indicators like hopelessness or burden are stated, but the plea for help implies distress.
   - The desire to die is clear and personal, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is an explicit phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, the desire to die is clear from the plea for help to commit suicide.
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal) is mentioned.
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation, as the writer is seeking to obtain these substances.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current intention or future plan, not a past event.
   - No specific initiated action (e.g., taking pills) is described; the content is preparatory.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die (""help me kill myself""), ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - A specific method (barbiturates) and preparation (seeking to find them) are mentioned, so it cannot be 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The combination of suicidal intent with a method and preparation aligns with 'Behavior'.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes key elements such as a direct inquiry about a ""painless way to die"" and expressions like ""I want to sleep forever,"" indicating thoughts about death and a desire for cessation of life. Emotional indicators are strong, including hopelessness (""I'm struggling,"" ""I feel worthless""), despair (""I'm tired,"" ""The world scares me""), and feelings of being a burden (""I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). No past actions related to suicide attempts or self-harm are described. The temporal context lacks imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), and the desire for death is expressed with uncertainty about means (""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it does express a clear personal desire to die through indirect yet unambiguous statements (e.g., ""I want to sleep forever""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author is resisting them; instead, the author is actively seeking information on painless death, confirming a genuine wish to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation. The question about a ""painless way to die"" is general and exploratory, not indicative of a concrete plan or imminent action. This absence of detail means the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts but no past or recent suicidal actions. There is no reference to any initiated, potentially lethal behavior (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). The content focuses on present ideation without action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to sleep forever""), placing it beyond 'Indicator', which requires no such desire. However, the lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no description of past or recent suicidal actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable. The content fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and a wish to not be alive, but without actionable details. Uncertainty about methods reinforces this classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""want to kill myself,"" ""i still want to die,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""life is all pointless""), anhedonia (""nothing matters""), existential despair (""none of it will matter when you're dead"").  
   - Plans/methods/preparations: **None mentioned**. No tools, locations, or preparatory actions (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - Past actions: References ""constantly thinking"" about suicide but **no concrete past actions** (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took pills,"" or ""wrote a note"").  
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""i still want to die,"" with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""i still want to die"" show a clear personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None**: While suicidal desire is explicit, there is **no mention** of a plan, method, tools, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on persistent thoughts (""for a year straight"") but **no description of initiated actions**. Past references are solely to ideation (""thinking about""), not attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation cited (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""gun,"" ""note"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of concrete, initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  
   - **Ideation**: Fits perfectly—explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts (""constantly thinking""), but **lacks any plan, method, or preparation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""I'm in so much mental pain,"" ""I can't handle it,"" ""I hate everything,"" and a desire for relief: ""I need peace.""
   - There is a clear desire for death or cessation of existence: ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it,"" and ""I want it to stop."" These phrases indicate a personal wish to die.
   - The timeline is imminent (""tonight""), suggesting urgency.
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - The desire to turn ""mental pain into physical"" could imply self-harm, but it is vague and not explicitly linked to a suicidal method or plan.
   - No past suicidal actions or attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it contains strong indirect expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I don't wanna survive it""). These convey a clear personal wish for death.
   - There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). The author actively desires death as relief from pain.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned.
   - No tools, locations, or preparations are referenced.
   - The phrase ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" is ambiguous and could relate to self-harm, but it does not specify a plan or means for suicide. Without explicit details, this does not constitute a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""tonight"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was started or completed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die, which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit suicidal desire).
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Given the explicit desire to die without a plan or method, this aligns with 'Ideation'. The imminence (""tonight"") increases urgency but does not introduce a plan, keeping it within 'Ideation' per the rules (when unsure about plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior').

I'm so sick n I just wanna die. It's the best for me,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't have a purpose""), and despair (""sick of feeling pain""). It directly mentions a desire to die with the phrase ""I just wanna die"" and reinforces this with ""It's the best for me,"" indicating a personal wish to not be alive. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). No past or recent suicidal actions are described, and there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire to die is stated as a genuine sentiment without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with ""I just wanna die."" This is a clear, personal statement of suicidal intent from the author, with no negation (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The content focuses solely on emotional state and desire, without any details on how suicide might be carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. The language is present-tense and contemplative (e.g., ""I'm feeling,"" ""I just wanna die""), not indicative of initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I just wanna die"") and absence of any plan/method/preparation rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire) and 'Behavior' (which requires evidence of planning). No concrete past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. This aligns with 'Ideation', as the author expresses a current suicidal desire without specifics on execution.

I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""kill myself,"" which refers to suicide, but it is framed as an intrusive thought: ""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself, but I don't actually want to."" 
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being ""ugly,"" ""stupid,"" ""not good enough,"" tiredness, loneliness, and struggling with self-love, but these reflect general distress rather than active suicidal intent.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions, only thoughts.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is indicated.
   - The writer explicitly states the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and not desired: ""I don't actually want to,"" indicating distress about the thoughts rather than a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase.
   - However, the desire to die is clearly negated: ""but I don't actually want to."" The primary sentiment is distress about unwanted thoughts, not a personal desire for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The suicide reference is general and not tied to any actionable plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current, ongoing thoughts (""my brain keeps telling me""), not past or future actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action, only intrusive thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted and not desired by the author. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress about suicidal thoughts without a current personal desire to die.
   - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal desire to die (the desire is negated). 
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so it is not an 'Attempt'.
   - The emphasis on unwanted thoughts and lack of intent supports 'Indicator', especially given the rule to choose 'Indicator' if there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die now,"" ""erase all traces of my existence.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""stuck, stagnant""), feeling damaged, worthlessness (""everyone is going to be better without me""), anhedonia (""can't feel nothing"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: ""run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids.""  
   - Preparations: None mentioned.  
   - Past actions: No initiated suicidal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried X"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - Clear desire to die: Yes. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific methods: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" (violent confrontation) and ""find a dealer with some opioids"" (overdose).  
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means), but methods are concrete.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""now,"" ""would go for it"").  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""schizo-affective disorder,"" severe distress (e.g., ""haven't slept in weeks,"" ""people are going to hurt me,"" ""I'm deteriorating""), hopelessness (""It's not working anymore""), and a desire to end suffering (""I just want to get it over with""). There is fear of pain associated with an implied action (""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it""), but no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods. No specific plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions are described. The temporal context is present-focused, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The author expresses a desire to end their situation but with ambivalence due to fear of pain.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The phrase ""I just want to get it over with"" implies a desire to end life or suffering, similar to examples like ""I want it to be over,"" which indicates suicidal intent. However, there is no explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent direct phrases. The fear of pain (""if I go through with it"") suggests contemplation of an action but does not negate the desire; instead, it highlights ambivalence. While suicidal intent is inferred, it is not unambiguous due to the lack of explicit language. Given the ambiguity, this leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules (if in doubt, choose 'Indicator').

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to ""the pain if I go through with it"" implies a method could be considered but lacks any detail or plan. Without explicit planning elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional distress and contemplation (""if I go through with it"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt, interrupted or otherwise). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses distress and a desire to end suffering, which could imply suicidal ideation, but the lack of explicit suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die"") and absence of a plan, method, or preparation means it does not clearly meet 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. Per the rules, ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire defaults to 'Indicator'. The core sentiment is distress about their mental state, not an explicit, current personal wish to die. Mentions like ""get it over with"" are concerning but vague, fitting 'Indicator' (e.g., discussing abstract or unwanted thoughts without clear intent). No elements qualify for higher categories.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses feelings of hopelessness (""everyone leaves you eventually""), self-blame (""maybe it's me?""), and emotional pain (""it still hurts"").  
   - Mentions pushing people away due to fear of abandonment and feeling unworthy (""I'd leave myself if I could"").  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or plans.**  
   - Emotional indicators include despair, isolation, and resignation (""it starts to hurt less""), but **no genuine desire to die is expressed**. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical self-rejection, not a literal death wish.  
   - **No past actions, preparations, timelines, or imminent intentions** related to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mentions** of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die. The distress centers on relational patterns, not ending life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

   - The post shows **distress, hopelessness, and relational dysfunction** but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - Fits **""Indicator""**: Emotional pain is evident, but suicidal intent is absent. The metaphorical language (""I'd leave myself"") does not imply literal suicidal ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound distress, feelings of inadequacy (""failed all development stages""), codependency (""can't think for myself""), hopelessness (""no hope""), and anhedonia (""apathetic,"" ""anhedonic"").  
   - Explicit suicide intent: ""i plan to kill myself at 21"" directly states a personal plan to die. The phrase ""whether i want to or not"" suggests internal conflict but does not negate the stated plan.  
   - Method/plan: A timeline (""at 21"") is specified, but no concrete method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - Temporal context: The action is future-oriented (""at 21""), not past or recent. No description of initiated actions (e.g., past attempts).  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""not fixable,"" ""no hope""), worthlessness (""no one wants to be with a person like this""), and despair (""this is hell"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""i plan to kill myself"" is an explicit, personal declaration of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A general timeline (""at 21"") is mentioned, but **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **future intent** (""plan to kill myself at 21""), not past/recent actions. No evidence of initiated suicidal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (""plan to kill myself""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - No specific method/preparation is mentioned (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""gun,"" ""note""), so it does not qualify for **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to...""), ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - While distress is pervasive, the explicit suicidal intent moves this beyond **Indicator**.

Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?I have prolly stopped making sense at this point. But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and expresses hopelessness (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""), isolation, and emotional distress (""sick and tired of crying myself to sleep every night""). 
    - It directly mentions suicide (""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon"") but explicitly negates imminent action by deferring it (""given myself 5 more years""). 
    - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), preparation (e.g., note-writing), or location. 
    - No past suicidal actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**, the post uses direct phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a personal desire to die. However, the writer explicitly states they will not act soon (""not any time soon""), framing the suicidal thoughts as deferred rather than immediate or actionable.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No** specific method, tools, preparations, or timelines for action are mentioned. The reference to ""5 more years"" explicitly delays any potential action and lacks concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post focuses on current emotional pain and future-oriented but non-imminent thoughts (""not any time soon""). There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and direct mention of suicide (""kill myself"") exceed the threshold for 'Indicator' (which requires no genuine personal desire). 
    - However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The deferred timeline (""5 more years"") and lack of actionable steps further support 'Ideation'. 
    - No past/current initiated lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. 
    - Thus, the core elements align with **Ideation**: clear personal suicidal desire without a plan or preparations.

14,"It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""the only way out is suicide,"" ""I should just make my escape,"" ""I've considered hanging.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""things are just crushing,"" ""I feel so empty""), despair (repeated failures, unfair treatment, overwhelming stress), anhedonia (""I have no interest in doing anything"").  
   - Method mentioned: ""hanging.""  
   - Desire vs. action: Expresses desire (""I should make my escape"") but explicitly states inability to act (""I can't seem to go through with it,"" ""I don't have the guts"").  
   - No preparation described (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions; only thoughts and considerations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""make my escape"" (in context of despair), and explicit desire (""the only way out is suicide"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but framed with ambivalence (""considered... but I can't go through with it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: ""hanging.""  
   - **No preparation**: No evidence of acquiring means, selecting a location, or rehearsing.  
   - Despite method reference, absence of concrete planning/preparation leans away from 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current/future thoughts** (""I've considered hanging,"" ""I should make my escape"").  
   - **No past/recent actions**: No description of initiating self-harm (e.g., ""I tried hanging but stopped""). Only contemplation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""suicide"" as an escape) → Not 'Indicator'.  
   - Method mentioned (""hanging"") but **no plan/preparation** → Falls under 'Ideation' (per rules: ""If unsure about explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"").  
   - No initiated action → Not 'Attempt'.  
   - Core theme: Strong suicidal ideation with a method considered but no intent/ability to act.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal notes,"" indicating personal intent and preparation.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"") and a decisive tone (""i've decided on it"").
   - Specific plans or methods are implied but not detailed (""just a matter of when and how"").
   - Preparations are explicitly stated: ""i already got my suicidal notes ready.""
   - Imminence is indicated with a timeframe (""not for another year""), but not immediate.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and shows a genuine desire to die (""i've decided on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is not detailed, but the phrase ""matter of when and how"" implies active planning.
   - Explicit preparation is present: ""got my suicidal notes ready,"" which qualifies as a key preparatory step.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions and preparations, with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an actual suicide attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit suicidal desire and preparation (suicide notes), moving beyond mere thoughts to actionable planning. This aligns with 'Behavior,' which requires both suicidal intent and evidence of planning/preparation. There is no indication of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 'Ideation' is insufficient due to the preparation element, and 'Indicator' is ruled out by the explicit personal desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post focuses on intense self-hatred, body image issues, and a desire to be someone else. Key elements include expressions of disgust with one's appearance (""i feel so ugly and horrible,"" ""i hate everything about myself""), frustration with self-perception (""im sick of seeing my face,"" ""im tired of seeing myself in every mirror""), and attempts to change appearance (dyeing hair, changing clothes, adjusting diet). 
   - There are **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means**. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i still look disgusting"") and despair, but these are tied to self-image, not a wish to die. 
   - **No specific plans, methods, or preparations** for suicide are present. The actions described (e.g., changing hair, clothes) are efforts to improve self-image, not suicidal behaviors. 
   - **No references to past suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts or self-harm). The past actions are solely about appearance changes. 
   - **No imminence** of any harmful intent; the wish is hypothetical (""i just wish i could press a button and be someone else""). 
   - The **stated desire** is to escape self-perception by becoming ""someone else,"" not to die or end life. There is no expression of suicidal thoughts or a desire for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or similar direct phrases (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""). 
   - **No clear desire to die** or not be alive is expressed. The wish to ""be someone else"" implies a transformation, not cessation of existence. 
   - **Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned**, so the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant. 
   - This strongly leans toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific method, tool, substance, or location** for suicide is mentioned or implied. 
   - **No signs of preparation** for suicide (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The described actions are cosmetic and non-lethal. 
   - Since no plan or method is present, 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions related to appearance changes (e.g., ""i've dyed and cut my hair""), but these are **not suicidal actions**. 
   - **No description of initiated, potentially lethal actions** (e.g., self-harm or suicide attempts) in the past or present. 
   - 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses **general distress and hopelessness** about self-image without any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions. 
   - It falls under 'Indicator' because it lacks explicit suicidal intent and instead focuses on distress about appearance and identity. The wish to ""be someone else"" is not equivalent to a desire to die. 
   - There is no ambiguity that would push this to 'Ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts) since death or suicide is not mentioned. 
   - Rules reminder: The risk applies only to the author, and there is no evidence of ideation, behavior, or attempt related to suicide.

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post questions the motives of people who post about intending to kill themselves or being in the process. The author speculates that such posters are ""looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves."" There are **no** personal expressions of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions by the author. The focus is entirely on analyzing *others'* behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: The author mentions suicide only in reference to hypothetical others (""anyone that posts they are going to kill themselves""). There is **no** personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The statement ""isn't really wanting to hurt themselves"" further reinforces this is an abstract discussion about others' motives.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: **No** personal plan, method, or preparation is mentioned or implied by the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: **No** description of past or recent personal suicidal actions by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post expresses an opinion about suicide-related posts abstractly and discusses others' potential motives. It contains **no** personal suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions from the author. This aligns with **Indicator**, which covers general discussions about suicide without personal intent.

I just want someone to love me and accept me and its never going to happen. I want to be brave enough to kill myself but the past two times ive tried ive failed. Im so tired and sad.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"" and references to past actions: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" 
   - Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""no point in existing,"" ""it's never going to happen""), despair (""Im so tired of being alive""), and feelings of being a burden (""every thing you do... hurts the people that you love"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for future suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing).
   - The post describes past suicidal actions (""tried"") that were initiated but failed.
   - There is a current desire to die (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself""), with no statement indicating these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself,"" ""no point in being alive anymore""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation for a future suicide is mentioned. The references to past attempts do not include details about methods, and there is no current planning described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes both current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") and past actions: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed."" The past actions are concrete, self-initiated, and potentially lethal (as they were ""tried"" and failed), fitting the definition of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts lean toward 'Ideation' or higher, but the mention of past attempts shifts the focus. 
   - Per the rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" Here, the past actions (""tried"") are clearly described as concrete, potentially lethal acts that were initiated, even though they failed. 
   - This takes precedence over current ideation or behavior. There is no current plan or preparation, so 'Behavior' is not applicable. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit personal suicidal desire. 
   - Therefore, the category is 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - It expresses a clear desire to not be alive with the statement ""I don't want to be alive,"" indicating hopelessness and despair.
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.
   - The temporal context is general; there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer's desire is explicit and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" a direct suicidal phrase.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die with ""I don't want to be alive.""
   - There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or undesired by the author; the tone affirms the desire.
   - This rules out 'Indicator' as the suicidal intent is personal and explicit.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - The phrase ""killing myself"" is general and lacks details about how, when, or where it might occur.
   - Without any plan or preparation elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past actions.
   - There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no references to trying or attempting something).
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""killing myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive""), placing it above 'Indicator'.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent action is described, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die without any actionable elements.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""My desire to kill myself"" (direct suicidal intent), ""Killing myself"" (method implied via context), and specific past actions (""I've attempted an overdose... twice within the past two weeks"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""Why bother?"", ""What's the point?""), despair (""waste your energy,"" ""bullshit I've endured""), and anhedonia (""what little motivation... ripped from your hands"").  
   - Specific methods/preparations: ""Overdose"" explicitly stated as a method used in past attempts. No *current* plan/preparation described beyond desire.  
   - Past actions: Clearly describes **multiple initiated, potentially lethal acts** (""attempted an overdose... twice within two weeks"").  
   - Imminence: No explicit timeline for future intent, but past attempts are very recent (within two weeks).  
   - Desire: Explicit personal wish to die (""I just want out... I'd honestly choose that"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""My desire to kill myself"" and ""Killing myself"" are direct, personal expressions of desire to die. No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method: ""Overdose"" is explicitly mentioned as a method used in past attempts. Metaphorical language (""hit by an incoming train"") implies consideration of violent means but lacks specificity for future plans.  
   - Preparation: None described for future intent.  
   - **Key focus**: Past attempts dominate the classification.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions**: Details multiple *initiated, potentially lethal acts* (""attempted an overdose... twice within two weeks""). This qualifies as concrete suicidal behavior with intent to die.  
   - Current state: Expresses ongoing desire to die but no description of *new* imminent plans/preparations.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past overdose attempts are **concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions** (definition of **Attempt**).  
   - Rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'."" The recentness (within two weeks) reinforces this.  
   - Current suicidal desire and metaphorical references to methods (""hit by a train"") do not override the precedence of documented past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense distress: ""fucking horrified,"" ""keep crying,"" ""panic attacks,"" ""so fucking scared.""  
   - Focuses on health anxiety (diabetes concerns, DIY HRT risks) and fear of parental judgment.  
   - Expresses overwhelm (""it's just too much"") and hopelessness about existing issues.  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**  
   - Emotional indicators: Fear, panic, feeling trapped (""can't live without estrogen""), but **no explicit desire to die**.  
   - Closest phrase: ""I can't live without estrogen"" is figurative distress, not literal suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die.  
   - Distress is centered on health fears and external pressures, **not a wish to end life**.  
   - Unwanted suicidal thoughts are **absent**; the post seeks help for anxiety.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No references** to plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current emotional distress**, not past actions.  
   - **No mention** of prior suicidal behavior, attempts, or self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: The post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and fear but lacks personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions. The phrase ""I can't live without estrogen"" is contextualized as dependency on HRT, not a death wish. Suicidal intent is absent, and primary themes are anxiety/helplessness.  
   - **Not Ideation/Behavior/Attempt**: No desire to die, no plans, and no descriptions of past/current suicidal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""There is NO hope left"") and despair due to failed treatments (medication, biofeedback, therapy, EMDR, TMS) and financial hardship (inability to afford Ketamine, living on $786/month, not eating some days). 
   - There is an explicit mention of suicide intent: ""Now it's time to end it,"" which implies a current desire to die. 
   - The phrase ""So I tried. And I tried again. And I tried. And I tried some more"" is ambiguous; it could refer to past efforts to seek treatment or endure hardship, but it does not explicitly describe a specific suicidal action (e.g., no mention of methods like pills or jumping, no preparations like writing a note). 
   - No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. 
   - The temporal context includes past struggles (""tried"" repeatedly) and a current/future intention (""Now it's time to end it""), but there is no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal act that was potentially lethal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through the phrase ""end it,"" which is a direct euphemism for suicide. 
   - There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no language like ""I don't want to die""). The sentiment is one of current intent, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. ""End it"" is vague and does not imply a plan. 
   - Without a clear plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post references past events (""I tried..."") but these are not clearly described as concrete suicidal actions. They could refer to treatment efforts or general endurance, not initiated lethal behavior. 
   - ""Now it's time to end it"" indicates a future intention, not a past action. 
   - There is no description of a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated (e.g., ""I took pills"" or ""I cut myself""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows a clear personal desire to die (""Now it's time to end it""), which excludes 'Indicator' (which is for general distress without suicidal intent). 
   - Since there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. 
   - The ambiguous ""tried"" references do not clearly describe a past suicidal act with initiation, so 'Attempt' is not appropriate. 
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but without any plan, method, or preparation.

I feel lonely I feel like I am only watching other living human beings. I feel like I am on the moon. I am very unconnocted with this world. In the pas I tried to hide this with saying ""I am misanthrope"" but no I wish I could have friends who supports me. I feel like a creature.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""thinking about suicide"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing fills the hole in my heart""), despair (""I feel lonely""), feeling disconnected (""I am very unconnocted with this world""), and distress about social isolation (""People bully me everywhere,"" ""I wish I could have friends"").
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").
   - References to past actions are about hiding feelings (""I tried to hide this with saying 'I am misanthrope'""), not about suicidal behaviors or attempts.
   - The writer states they are ""trying to survive,"" suggesting active resistance to suicidal thoughts and no current intent to act.
   - The desire expressed is conflicted: suicidal thoughts are present but accompanied by a stated effort to stay alive, indicating distress about the thoughts rather than a clear wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""thinking about suicide,"" which is a direct phrase related to suicide.
   - However, the writer does not express a clear, current desire to die; instead, they emphasize ""trying to survive,"" which explicitly negates the suicidal thoughts as unwanted or not acted upon. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The focus is on thoughts and emotional distress, not planning or action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current, ongoing suicidal thoughts (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, even if interrupted). The only past reference is non-suicidal (hiding feelings).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts could suggest 'Ideation', but the writer's clear statement of ""trying to survive"" frames these thoughts as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes expressions of distress about suicidal thoughts when explicitly negated or unwanted.
   - There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Ambiguity exists between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to the mention of suicidal thoughts, but the emphasis on survival indicates the thoughts are not desired. Following the rule (""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator""), 'Indicator' is the best fit.

24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""I've given up in life""), despair over life circumstances (dropping out, losing friends, weight gain, lack of relationships), and a lack of fear of death (""There is no hell so I'm not scared to die""). It explicitly mentions having a ""plan, note and date"" for early April, indicating specific preparations for a suicidal act. There is no mention of past suicidal actions or methods initiated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it implies a desire to die through statements like ""I'm not scared to die"" in the context of despair and having a plan. The writer expresses a current reason to live (not tormenting family) but contradicts this with concrete plans for death, indicating a genuine, though conflicted, desire to die. Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they are accompanied by preparation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific preparations are mentioned: ""I have a plan, note and date."" The ""plan"" implies a method (even if not detailed), the ""note"" confirms preparation (suicide note), and the ""date"" (early April) sets a timeline. This clearly indicates planning and preparation elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past life events (e.g., dropping out of college) but no past suicidal actions. The suicidal plan is future-oriented (""will be in early April""), with no indication that any self-initiated, potentially lethal action has occurred. Thus, there is no description of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (inferred from context) and specific preparations (plan, note, date) rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire). The presence of a plan and preparations moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which involves desire but no plan). The lack of any initiated action rules out 'Attempt'. This aligns with 'Behavior' due to the stated plan and preparations for a future suicidal act.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and repeatedly references a desire to die (e.g., ""tell them I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me,"" ""end up dead in a gutter""), despair (""constantly on edge,"" ""ready to explode""), and feelings of being a burden (""best for society if I just stay on the inside""). There is no specific method, tool, location, or substance mentioned for suicide (e.g., no pills, guns, bridges). Preparations like writing a note or acquiring means are absent. The author describes self-harm (""cuts I have all over myself""), but this is presented as existing injuries from past behavior, not as part of current suicidal preparation. Imminence is indicated with ""this will probably be my last post ever"" and ""Goodbye,"" but the author states they are ""still debating"" and ""haven't even left home yet,"" suggesting no immediate action. The desire to die is expressed, but there is also consideration of seeking help (checking into a hospital), which doesn't negate the suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" multiple times and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""actually do go through with it and kill myself""). Suicidal thoughts are described as overwhelming, but the author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to act on them; instead, they are actively debating between seeking help or committing suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide method, tool, or location is mentioned or implied. References to self-harm (cuts) are not tied to a suicide plan and appear to be past or ongoing behavior. The mention of going to the ER is framed as a help-seeking alternative to suicide, not as part of suicidal preparation. Therefore, there is no identifiable plan, method, or preparation for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses future intentions (""still debating"" between seeking help or suicide) and a possible farewell (""last post ever""), but no past or recent suicidal actions are described. The self-harm (cuts) is not presented as a suicide attempt; it is contextualized as a symptom of anger and mental distress. No initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., an attempt) is mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""I'm going to kill myself""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire to die). However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The self-harm and emotional distress do not constitute a suicide attempt, as no concrete, potentially lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation', as it centers on suicidal thoughts and desire without actionable plans or methods.

I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""kill myself,"" ""suicidal.""  
   - Method: ""a good clif"" (cliff) is specified as a potential means, with distance noted (""4-5km"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Im not special to anything""), distrust of support (""they insist they care but i dont believe it""), and exhaustion (""Im so tired"").  
   - Desire vs. action: Expresses desire (""I can't kill myself"") but explicitly states inability to act (""i just can't commit to it""). No preparation (e.g., going to the cliff) or past action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""kill myself,"" ""suicidal."" Desire is personal but paired with self-reported inability to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method: Specific location (""clif"") and feasibility (""possible to get there"") imply a plan. However, the author negates commitment (""can't commit to it""), indicating no active preparation or intent to execute.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past/current actions: Focuses on hypothetical future action (""its possible"") but explicitly rejects follow-through.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (Ideation/Behavior).  
   - Specific method (cliff) is mentioned, but no preparations (e.g., traveling there) or imminent intent. Rules state: ""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation'."" Here, the plan is acknowledged but dismissed by the author, leaning closer to **Behavior** due to method specificity.  
   - No past/recent lethal actions (Attempt ruled out).  
   - Final note: Ambivalence (""can't commit"") doesn’t negate the presence of a plan/method, per Behavior criteria.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress, hopelessness, despair, and feelings of worthlessness (e.g., ""tired of everything,"" ""tired of hating myself,"" ""tired of crying myself to sleep,"" ""i have nothing going for me"").  
   - Mentions a desire for cessation of suffering (""i just want it all to stop"") and regret about existence (""i wish i was never born"").  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.**  
   - **No indications of plans, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions.**  
   - The primary sentiment is exhaustion and a wish to escape pain, not a stated intent to end life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a desire to die.  
   - Wishing to ""never have been born"" reflects existential despair but lacks a current, actionable desire for death.  
   - The phrase ""want it all to stop"" emphasizes distress relief, not active suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional suffering but **no references to past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post falls under **Indicator**: It expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and a wish to escape suffering but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors. Phrases like ""want it all to stop"" and ""wish I was never born"" align with abstract dissatisfaction rather than active ideation. Without clear suicidal intent or planning, it does not meet thresholds for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt.

Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly states ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal intent and desire to die. 
   - Emotional indicators include depression, frustration (""shit show""), and feelings of isolation (dismissive family/friends). 
   - There is **no mention** of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). 
   - The phrase ""can't wait"" suggests future intent but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete planning. 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" are used. 
   - **Yes**: The author expresses a clear desire to die (""have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral"" as a ""last big fuck you""). 
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, gun), plan details, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, note-writing) are mentioned. The funeral reference is a consequence, not a plan element.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes **future intent** (""can't wait to..."") but **no past/recent initiated actions**. The frustration with family is contextual, not a description of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") places this above *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal intent). 
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out *Behavior*. 
   - No description of past/recent concrete actions rules out *Attempt*. 
   - **Ideation** fits best: clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no plan/method/preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit references to suicide: ""end it all"" and ""goodbye everybody"" indicate a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care"") and a sense of isolation.  
   - A specific plan or method is implied with ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" though the exact method is not detailed.  
   - Preparations are suggested through statements like ""I'm ready"" and ""I'm not gonna tell anyone,"" indicating intentional secrecy.  
   - The post references a past action: ""all ready tried that before"" refers to telling people about distress (not a suicide attempt), as clarified by the context of seeking help.  
   - Imminence is indicated with ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" placing the intent in the near future but not immediate.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicidal intent through phrases like ""end it all,"" which is a direct equivalent to ""kill myself"" in context.  
   - Yes, there is a clear desire to die (e.g., ""goodbye everybody"" reinforces this intent).  
   - There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them; instead, the tone is affirmative.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes, a method is strongly implied with ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" indicating a specific plan is in place, even if not detailed.  
   - Preparations are inferred from ""I'm ready,"" ""I'm not gonna tell anyone"" (suggesting secrecy as part of the plan), and the overall decisiveness.  
   - This points toward 'Behavior' due to the presence of a plan element.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""wait a few weeks"") and a past action of seeking help (""tried that before""), but no past or recent suicidal action is described. ""Tried that"" refers to disclosing distress, not a suicide attempt.  
   - There is no mention of a concrete, initiated suicidal act (e.g., no description of self-harm or an attempt that was started).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""end it all"") rules out 'Indicator,' as this is not general distress or unwanted thoughts.  
   - The presence of a plan/method (""know how I'm gonna do it"") elevates this beyond 'Ideation,' which requires no plan.  
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' fits best, as the post includes both suicidal desire and an indication of a plan/method.  
   - IMPORTANT: The ambiguity rule (if unsure about plan, choose 'Ideation') does not apply here because ""know how"" explicitly confirms a method is planned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""kill myself"" and frustration about inability to do so (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""burden my whole life""), self-loathing (""disappointment,"" ""everything wrong with the world""), and perceived burden to others.  
   - Specific method/means: References holding a blade as a suicide method.  
   - Preparation: Describes holding the blade (access to means) but explicitly states no action taken (""can't fucking do it"").  
   - Imminence: No timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""); focuses on frustration over inaction.  
   - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"") with distress about inability to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (blade) → **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action (only contemplation with means) → Not **Attempt**.  
   - Method/plan confirmed → Not **Ideation**.  
   - Explicit personal suicidal intent → Not **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and being misunderstood (e.g., ""depressed 16 year old,"" ""stripping yourself of individuality,"" ""family doesn't like... but doesn't even deal with him"").
   - It mentions death directly with the phrase ""how about i die then,"" but this is framed as a rhetorical question directed at others (""is that what you ask for?""), rather than a clear personal declaration of intent.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, or notes).
   - There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - The temporal context is current and hypothetical, with no indication of imminence (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous; the death reference appears to be an expression of frustration or a challenge to others, not an explicit wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct terms; it uses ""die"" in a rhetorical context.
   - The desire to die is not clearly expressed as a personal intent; it is questioned (""how about i die then"") and attributed to others' perceived expectations (""is that what you ask for?""). This leans toward distress about the situation rather than a genuine wish to die.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted, but the context suggests frustration rather than intent, this fits better under 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, or preparations are mentioned. The death reference is vague and lacks concrete details (e.g., no method, tools, or steps described).
   - Without any planning elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a hypothetical scenario about dying. There is no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, even failed or interrupted ones).
   - The focus is on feelings and rhetoric, not actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and abstract references to death, but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. The key phrase ""how about i die then"" is rhetorical and directed at others, indicating distress rather than a genuine wish to die.
   - Ambiguity exists in whether the death reference reflects true suicidal ideation, but the phrasing and context suggest it is more about expressing frustration. Following the rule to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, 'Indicator' is appropriate.
   - No plan/method/preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior', and no past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""no hope,"" ""all is lost,"" ""pointless, meaningless, waste of energy.""  
   - Desire: Strong personal commitment (""100% confirmed,"" ""Nothing anyone can do or say can save my life"").  
   - Timeframe: Vague future (""before 2023 birthday""), no specific date/imminence.  
   - No method, plan details, or preparations (e.g., tools, notes, locations).  
   - Past action: ""At least I DID try"" implies prior struggles but lacks specifics about concrete suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life,"" and ""100% confirmed"" express unambiguous personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: Despite certainty of intent, no method (pills, weapons), plan steps, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, notes) are mentioned. Timeframe is generalized.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Future intention**: Focuses on ""will happen"" before 2023, not recent/past actions. ""I DID try"" is too vague to confirm a prior *concrete, lethal action* (required for 'Attempt').  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong suicidal **desire** qualifies for at least 'Ideation'.  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - Vague past reference (""I DID try"") lacks evidence of a *specific lethal action*, so 'Attempt' is inapplicable.  
   - Thus, **Ideation** fits best: Explicit desire to die, no plan/method.

33,"I'm so so tired. I'm so tired . My mind , my soul , my heart. I'm tired of being criticized and unloved . I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago and I was a pussy . I shouldn't have talked myself down . Everyday I want to go back and kill myself . The worse decision I ever made was staying here .",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses exhaustion and emotional pain (""I'm so tired,"" ""tired of being criticized and unloved"").  
   - Explicitly mentions suicide: ""kill myself"" (twice), regret for not acting (""I was a pussy,"" ""I shouldn't have talked myself down"").  
   - References a past opportunity to act (""6 months ago"") but states **no action was taken** (only an opportunity existed, and they ""talked [themself] down"").  
   - Expresses a current, persistent desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline for future action is mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and regret over not acting indicate a genuine desire to die. The writer does not frame thoughts as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While a past ""opportunity"" is referenced, no method or tools are specified. No current preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past opportunity** (6 months ago) but **no action was initiated**. The phrase ""talked myself down"" confirms no lethal act occurred.  
   - Current statements (""Everyday I want to..."") reflect ongoing ideation without indication of imminent action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and regret over inaction confirm **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned → **Ideation**.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/current initiated action (only a missed opportunity) → Not Attempt.  

**Conclusion**: The core elements are explicit suicidal desire and regret over past inaction, without a plan or described preparatory steps. This aligns with 'Ideation'.

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post focuses on feelings of weakness, embarrassment, and hopelessness in a toxic friendship situation. The author mentions being hurt by a best friend who is dating their ex, struggling to enforce boundaries, and feeling pathetic and used. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I know it's never gonna happen""), despair (""all I'm doing is embarrassing myself""), and self-deprecation (""I'm pathetic""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No references to past suicidal actions, plans, preparations, or imminence of harm. The author's stated desire is for normalcy and understanding (""I just want things to be normal,"" ""I just want him to understand""), not a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases.
   - No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive; instead, the author expresses distress about interpersonal issues and a longing for resolution.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so the question of them being unwanted is irrelevant.
   - Leaning towards 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent and the focus on general emotional distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation related to suicide is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of planning or preparatory actions for self-harm.
   - Without any suicidal desire or plan, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past events (e.g., trying to cut off the friend, giving an ultimatum) and current emotional struggles, but these are social in nature, not suicidal.
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal self-harm actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows distress, hopelessness, and self-criticism but lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past suicidal actions.
   - This aligns with 'Indicator', defined as expressing general distress without a clear, current personal desire to die or suicidal intent. The hopelessness here is situational (about relationships), and there is no ambiguity suggesting suicidal ideation.
   - Rules reinforce: When in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'; here, no suicidal elements exist.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""hate myself,"" hopelessness (""Never have I felt a lasting happiness""), feeling like a burden (""morally abhorrent piece of crap"").  
   - Expresses passive death wish: ""I just want to not exist"" and ""I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land.""  
   - Uses metaphorical suicide reference: ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working..."" (explicitly negated as non-literal).  
   - **No explicit desire to die by suicide**, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Focus is on emotional pain and escapism.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"" (beyond the metaphorical/negated usage).  
   - Desire expressed is **passive** (""not exist"") or **conditional/fantasy-based** (""illusion land""), not an active wish to die.  
   - **Unwanted state**: Primary sentiment is distress about isolation and emotional pain, not a current intent to act on suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No mention of tools, locations, plans, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **ongoing emotional suffering**, not past/current suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Dominant themes are **distress, hopelessness, and passive escapism** without explicit suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.  
   - ""I just want to not exist"" aligns with abstract distress/escape (Indicator) rather than active suicidal intent (Ideation).  
   - Metaphorical suicide reference is explicitly negated.  
   - **No evidence for Ideation, Behavior, or Attempt** based on criteria.  
   - **Indicator** fits best due to ambiguous desire, focus on emotional pain, and lack of suicidal specificity.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post contains strong emotional distress (e.g., ""losing my mind,"" ""complete breakdown,"" ""hate myself,"" ""tired of being alone,"" ""feeling worthless""). There are explicit mentions of death/suicide, including ""end it,"" ""take my own life,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""I hate being alive"" (repeated multiple times). A specific method is referenced (""put a bullet right through it""), but no preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun) or plans (e.g., when or where) are described. The writer expresses a desire to die but also states an inability to act (""I don't have the balls to take my own life""). There are no references to past actions or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related phrases like ""end it,"" ""take my own life,"" and ""I just want to die."" It expresses a clear personal desire to die, as seen in the repeated declarations. The statement about lacking courage (""I don't have the balls..."") indicates distress but does not negate the desire to die; it reinforces the suicidal intent by expressing frustration over inaction. Thus, this is not a case of unwanted thoughts alone.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method (""put a bullet right through it"") is mentioned, but it is presented as a wish or thought rather than a concrete plan. There is no indication of preparation (e.g., having a gun, writing a note) or specific details about carrying it out. The context is expressive of desire, not planning. Given the rule to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan, this leans toward 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current feelings and desires. There is no description of past or recent actions (e.g., attempts, preparations initiated). The reference to not acting (""I don't have the balls..."") confirms no action was taken. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal intent). The mention of a method does not constitute a plan or preparation, so it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. With no evidence of initiated actions, 'Attempt' does not apply. The core content aligns with 'Ideation': strong personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a wish to die, without a specific, actionable plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" and a specific method (""take a bunch of pills"") with a situational plan (""while everyones asleep""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i really wasn't made for life,"" ""it's too painful,"" ""i loathe myself""), despair (""i can't keep doing this""), and feelings of being a burden (""i contribute nothing""). There is ambivalence due to fear (""i'm just too scared"") and concern for others (""i don't want to make my mother sad""). No past actions or preparations are described; the content focuses on current thoughts and hypothetical future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide (""suicide watch,"" ""end it"") and expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""i wish i could just fucking end it,"" ""subjectively it would be better if i was dead""). While there is ambivalence (fear of pain and not wanting to sadden others), the desire to die is present and not explicitly negated as unwanted thoughts alone.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""take a bunch of pills"") and a contextual plan is implied (""while everyones asleep""). This constitutes a method and a loose plan, even though no explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring pills) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""could take,"" ""wish"") but no past or recent initiated actions. All references are hypothetical or contemplative, not descriptions of concrete actions taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts rule out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (""pills"") and situational plan (""while everyones asleep"") elevates this beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. There is no description of an initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The ambivalence (fear, concern) does not negate the presence of a plan/method.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author discusses their own past suicidal struggles: ""I have been suicidal on-and-off,"" ""one very serious attempt in 2009,"" and current stability (""in a good place now, no suicidal ideation in months"").  
   - The author expresses distress about a **friend** who ""seems to have decided he is going to commit suicide soon (could be days).""  
   - No explicit mention of the author's *current* personal desire to die, plan, method, or preparation.  
   - Emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, anxiety) are attributed to the friend or the author’s past self.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author does **not** express a current personal desire to die. References to suicide are either:  
     - Historical (""attempt in 2009,"" past ideation).  
     - About the friend (""Friend may kill himself soon"").  
   - The author explicitly states they are currently stable (""no suicidal ideation in months"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned **for the author**. The friend’s situation is discussed, but the category applies only to the author.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The author references a past attempt (2009) but no recent or imminent action.  
   - Current content focuses on concern for the friend, not personal suicidal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress about a friend’s crisis and reflects on the author’s past mental health struggles.  
   - There is **no current personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or initiated action** by the author.  
   - General distress and discussion of suicide are present, but suicidal intent is historical or external (friend).  
   - **Indicator** fits best: distress is evident, but without a clear, current personal desire to die or active suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions recurring suicidal thoughts using the euphemism ""kermit sewer slide"" (phonetic for ""commit suicide""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (fear therapy won't work), shame (""live every moment in shame""), and distress (""tired of always being afraid"").
   - The thoughts are described as persistent (""even on happy days"") and ""tempting,"" but there is **no mention of a specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline** for acting on them.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The focus is on intrusive thoughts and distress about their mental state.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, suicidal intent is implied via the euphemism ""kermit sewer slide,"" confirming personal suicidal thoughts. However, the writer **frames these thoughts as intrusive/distressing** (""I still get the... thoughts"") and expresses a desire for therapy to work, indicating they do not genuinely want to act on them. The primary sentiment is fear of ineffective help, not a direct wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post only references abstract thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The content focuses solely on current thoughts and emotional struggles.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - While suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned, the writer emphasizes them as **unwanted/distressing intrusions** (""I still get the... thoughts"") and expresses active engagement in seeking help (therapy). There is **no clear desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to die"" is absent), and **no plan or behavior** is indicated. The core of the post is distress about mental health and fear of treatment failing, aligning with 'Indicator' (unwanted suicidal thoughts without genuine intent).

Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators include intense distress (""i cant breathe""), self-loathing (""im useless""), and perceived burdensomeness (""everyone would be better off with me dead"").

   - **No reference** to past actions, attempts, or preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""I want to kill myself"" is a direct, personal declaration of suicidal desire.  
   - **No indication** that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current emotional state and desire**; no description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"").

   - **Ideation** fits because:  
     - There is an explicit, personal desire to die (""I want to kill myself"").  
     - **No plan/method/preparation** is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
     - **No past/recent initiated action** (e.g., overdose attempt), ruling out 'Attempt'.  
     - The emotional content alone (distress, burdensomeness) would suggest 'Indicator', but the explicit suicidal intent overrides this.

   - Expresses emotional distress: ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" ""feeling more alone"".  
   - Describes a thought (""thought about"") but explicitly states no action: ""but i didnt do it"".  
   - No indication of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) or temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly references suicidal action (""slitting my wrists"").  
   - **Yes**: Desire is implied via consideration of a lethal method.

I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses dental issues causing pain, shame, and distress. It explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" as a result of the situation. There are emotional indicators like shame, hopelessness (""I feel so ashamed,"" ""paying the price""), and references to past depression. However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or actions. The suicidal feelings are described as recurring but not accompanied by any intent, plan, or imminent timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The author seeks dental advice, indicating a focus on problem-solving rather than acting on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings,"" which directly references suicide.
   - However, it does not express a clear, current desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). The wording focuses on feelings returning in the context of distress, without stating a personal wish to act on them. There is no indication that these feelings are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), but the lack of explicit desire or intent creates ambiguity.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The post only references feelings, not concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The suicidal feelings are described as ""coming back,"" implying a current or recurring state, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned. The reference to past depression and dental neglect does not involve suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The mention of ""suicidal feelings"" indicates distress and suicidal thoughts, but there is no explicit personal expression of a desire to die, no plan/method, and no action. This falls into a gray area between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. 
   - Following the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" Here, the ambiguity arises because the author discusses suicidal feelings without clearly stating a desire to act on them or die, and the primary focus is on distress from dental problems. Thus, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category.

If you want more information and are interested in helping, I can explain it better in the chat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""i'm someone who wants to die,"" which is a direct expression of a desire to die or not be alive, indicating potential suicidal intent. 
   - There are no specific references to death, dying, suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), or self-harm means. 
   - No plans, preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. 
   - The context is the author explaining why they can't post in certain subreddits, and they are seeking help for basic needs, but this doesn't negate the personal expression of suicidal desire. 
   - There are no references to past actions or attempts, and no imminence is suggested. 
   - The desire to die is stated without any indication that it is unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die (""wants to die"") in a context of despair. This is a personal statement from the author about themselves. 
   - There is no explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""wants to die"" is equivalent in conveying suicidal intent based on the guidelines. 
   - The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they are resisting them, so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) is mentioned or implied. 
   - No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. 
   - Since there is a desire to die but no plan or preparation, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current state of mind (""wants to die"") with no reference to past or recent actions. 
   - There is no description of any initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted behaviors), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""wants to die"") meets the criteria for 'Ideation' because it conveys suicidal thoughts without any mention of a plan, method, or preparation. 
   - It does not fit 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is clear and personal, not abstract or unwanted. 
   - It does not fit 'Behavior' because no plan or method is indicated. 
   - It does not fit 'Attempt' because no past or recent actions are described.

45,Anyone know how to write good suicide notes? I'm leaving soon but need my loved ones to know I love them so much but I don't know how to put it all into words. Don't say please don't go. Stay. My minds made up. I just need help on the goodbye letters,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post directly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" indicating preparation for suicide.  
   - Key phrases: ""I'm leaving soon,"" ""My minds made up,"" and requests for help writing notes.  
   - Emotional indicators: Resignation (""minds made up""), concern for loved ones, but no expressions of ambivalence or unwanted thoughts.  
   - Explicit references to suicide preparations (notes/letters) and temporal imminence (""soon"").  
   - No mention of past actions, methods (e.g., tools/locations), or interrupted attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. ""Leaving soon"" in context of suicide notes implies impending suicide. ""My minds made up"" confirms intent without hesitation or negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes. Writing ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters"" constitutes explicit **preparation**. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, but preparations alone qualify for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Focuses on future intent (""leaving soon"") and current preparations (writing notes). No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicide-focused preparations are present.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Goes beyond desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") by detailing concrete preparations.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (past or recent).  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + explicit preparations (writing notes) align with the 'Behavior' definition.

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" (past suicidal actions initiated).
   - Explicitly states ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date,"" indicating a specific future plan and timeline (""either that day or before it"").
   - Expresses despair (""hell,"" ""fucking done""), hopelessness (""I wasn't trying hard enough""), and mistrust of support systems.
   - Notes a barrier to acting (""only reason I didn't die last night was bc I actually wanna live..."") but emphasizes imminent intent (""end thing v v soon"").
   - Requests symbolic preparation (""save some flowers for me"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Directly uses ""suicide date"" and ""end thing,"" confirming personal desire to die. No negation of intent (e.g., ""I want to live"" is conditional on unmet needs, overridden by active planning).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: A specific date (May 14, 2021) is set for suicide, and urgency is implied (""before it""). This constitutes preparation/planning. No method is specified, but the temporal plan suffices for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past: References ""constant attempts"" (historical *attempts*).
   - Present/Future: Focuses on imminent plan (""This Friday... suicide date,"" ""end thing v v soon"").
   - **No concrete action was initiated recently** (barrier last night was desire for help, not an aborted action). Past attempts are noted but do not override the *current* planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal planning are present.
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific plan (date) elevates it beyond mere desire/thoughts.
   - **Not Attempt**: Describes past attempts but no *recent initiated lethal action* (last night’s non-action was due to hope for help, not an attempt). Current focus is on future intent with planning.
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific plan (date) meets criteria. Past attempts are context but don’t change the current classification.

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds.

They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""everything's pointless""), despair (""I am sick of everybody's fascination""), and a desire to cease existing (""I want to disappear forever"").  
   - Explicit statements about death: ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit"" implies a self-determined timeline for death.  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes).  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions. The phrase ""die by 35"" suggests future intent but lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire to die is clear (""I want to disappear forever""), but framed as an inevitability rather than an active plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" directly express a desire to cease existing and a personal expectation of early death. Though ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly stated, the context of despair confirms intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The timeline (""by 35"") is vague and distant.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described. The post discusses future intent without initiation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong desire to die (""disappear forever,"" ""die by 35"") places this beyond **Indicator** (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Core elements align with **Ideation**: explicit desire to die, no plan/method.

I'm trying to die not end up brain damaged. Shits difficult 😎",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide methods: ""hanging myself"" and ""taking these pills."" 
   - It expresses a desire to die (""I'm trying to die"") and frustration about potential failure (""might just break the shower,"" ""might be enough to make me sick but not die,"" ""not end up brain damaged""). 
   - The tone uses dark humor (😂, 😎), but the core intent is serious. 
   - No past actions are described; all references are hypothetical/future-oriented. 
   - No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes: Phrases like ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills,"" and ""I'm trying to die"" confirm a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes: Specific methods (hanging, pills) are discussed in detail, including practical considerations (weight impacting effectiveness, dosage risks). This indicates evaluation of plans, even if doubts exist.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No past or recent actions are described. The language is speculative (""might,"" ""idk if"") and focused on feasibility, not initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (rules out 'Indicator'). 
   - Methods are specified (rules out 'Ideation'). 
   - No concrete past/ongoing action (rules out 'Attempt'). 
   - The detailed method evaluation (""hanging,"" ""pills"") and problem-solving (""being fat makes it harder"") align with 'Behavior' (planning/preparation phase). Doubts about efficacy do not negate the presence of a plan.

I feel like I can't even think straight anymore, I don't know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""killing myself"" and ""I want to die,"" indicating explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. Emotional indicators include depression, numbness, hopelessness (""Everything is so much effort,"" ""I'm so fucking depressed and numb and sick of everything""), and impaired cognition (""I feel like I can't even think straight""). The user explicitly states they lack a specific plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself"") and expresses no intention to act due to fear of failure (""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up""). There is no mention of methods, tools, locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past suicidal actions. Help-seeking behavior is present (considering psych admission for safety), but this is not a suicidal preparation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die""). Although the user states they are unlikely to act due to fear, this does not negate the expressed desire; it only indicates ambivalence about acting on it. The primary sentiment includes distress about suicidal thoughts but does not explicitly frame the thoughts as unwanted in a way that eliminates the desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don't actually want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The user explicitly denies having a plan (""I don't have a specific plan for killing myself""), and considering psych admission is a protective action, not a suicidal behavior. Thus, no elements align with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and future uncertainty about help-seeking but describes no past or recent suicidal actions. References to not acting (""I'm probably not gonna do anything"") are about potential future inaction, not initiated behavior. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and mention of ""killing myself"" indicate personal suicidal thoughts, placing this beyond 'Indicator', which requires no clear current desire or explicitly unwanted thoughts. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no described past actions, 'Attempt' is irrelevant. The ambivalence about acting does not downgrade the expressed desire to 'Indicator'; it remains 'Ideation' due to the clear suicidal ideation without planning elements. Doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' is resolved by the unambiguous desire statement, but per rules, if there were ambiguity, 'Indicator' would be chosen—here, there is no ambiguity in the desire. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""pills"" repeatedly in the context of counting them nightly and regretting not taking them all.  
   - Expresses intense emotional distress (""nobody loves or cares for me,"" self-identified ""coward"").  
   - Refers to a specific method (overdosing via pills) and implies preparation (""count my pills"" nightly).  
   - Focuses on *regret for inaction* (""wonder why I didn’t take them all""), not a past action.  
   - No explicit negation of suicidal desire; regret implies wish to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""take them all"" (pills) strongly implies lethal intent.  
   - Desire to die is inferred from self-criticism about not acting (""why am I such a coward?"").  
   - No statement rejecting the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  
   → **Yes, implied desire to die.**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: Overdosing via pills.  
   - Preparation: Counting pills nightly indicates access to means and recurrent contemplation.  
   → **Plan/method/preparation present.**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *recurrent thoughts/urges* (nightly counting, daily regret) but **no past/current initiated action**.  
   - ""Didn’t take them all"" confirms inaction; no description of an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (implied by regret) + specific method (pills) + preparation (counting) → **Behavior**.  
   - Not *Attempt*: No initiated lethal action described.  
   - Not *Ideation*: Method/preparation elevates it beyond mere thoughts.  
   - Not *Indicator*: Personal desire to die is clear and unnegated.

I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""thoughts"" that are ""unbearably strong"" and in a ""major downward spiral,"" indicating emotional distress, hopelessness, and struggle with daily functioning. The writer references keeping this a secret to avoid hospitalization (""psych ward again""), suggesting past mental health issues, but there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or stated desire to die is present. The focus is on the burden of these thoughts and a fear of consequences (hospitalization), not on wanting to end life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone"") appear. The ""thoughts"" are described as distressing but are not specified as suicidal. If the thoughts are inferred to be related to suicide, the writer's avoidance of the psych ward implies they do not want to act on them, aligning more with distress about unwanted thoughts rather than a genuine wish to die. Thus, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses current struggles and past hospitalization but does not describe any initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm). The psych ward reference is vague and could relate to general mental health, not a concrete suicidal act. Thus, there is no basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows general distress and possible unwanted thoughts but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plan, or action. Ambiguity about the nature of the thoughts (e.g., whether they are suicidal) should default to 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" This fits 'Indicator' as it expresses distress without clear suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of emptiness, loneliness, being uncared for, hopelessness about finding love, and a loss of will to live. It explicitly mentions ""want to die"" in the context of romantic rejections and mental health struggles. However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The temporal context is current and general, with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states a personal desire to die: ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""want to die over not having a boyfriend."" This is a clear expression of suicidal intent from the author, not abstract or negated. The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; instead, they frame it as a genuine feeling affecting their mental health.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The focus is on emotional despair and the desire to die, without any details on how suicide might be carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with references to past rejections, but no description of any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an initiated attempt that was stopped or failed). All content relates to internal emotional states, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expressions of a desire to die (""lost all will to live"" and ""want to die"") indicate suicidal ideation. However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. There is no description of a past or recent suicidal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. While the post includes general distress, the personal and explicit suicidal intent pushes it out of 'Indicator' (which requires a lack of clear desire to die or unwanted thoughts). Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as defined by the presence of suicidal thoughts/desire without a specific plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""my death,"" ""off myself,"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" which are direct references to suicide and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i cant keep living with depression,"" ""i can't continue to live for decades to come"") and concern about being a burden (""don't want to ruin my mum's mental state"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The phrase ""when i off myself"" implies intent but is vague and lacks concrete details.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present; all statements are future-oriented or hypothetical.
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the timeline is general (""for decades to come"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore"") without indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""off myself"" (a direct synonym for suicide) and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die.
   - There is no statement negating or expressing distress about the suicidal thoughts themselves (e.g., no language like ""I don't want to act on this""). The primary sentiment is a wish to die, with concern focused on consequences, not on resisting the thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. ""Off myself"" is a general reference to suicide but does not describe how, when, or with what means.
   - Without any explicit plan or preparation elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""when i off myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was attempted, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore"") and suicidal thoughts (""off myself"") place this beyond 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means this does not qualify as 'Behavior' (where such details are required).
   - With no mention of past or recent actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but without specifics on planning or method.

   - Emotional indicators include despair, hopelessness, and anhedonia (e.g., ""i don't have energy,"" ""what's the point"").

   - No references to past actions or attempts; the suicide mention is future-oriented and conditional (""i'm going to end up getting fed up... and just killing myself"").
   - Imminence is not indicated; the phrasing ""end up getting fed up"" suggests a potential future outcome rather than an immediate plan.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die as a perceived solution to their struggles (""what's the point in not""), with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""just killing myself because what's the point in not""), framed as an inevitable result of ongoing distress.
   - No, there is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don't want to""). Instead, it is presented as a logical conclusion.
   - This confirms suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied; ""killing myself"" is general and non-specific.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are present.
   - Without any plan or method, the content does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. It remains at the level of thoughts and desire.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on a future intention (""i'm going to end up..."") rather than a past or recent event.
   - No description of any initiated action (e.g., taking pills, self-harm) that was potentially lethal. The reference to suicide is hypothetical and forward-looking.
   - This rules out 'Attempt', as there is no evidence of concrete, self-initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal desire (""killing myself"") without any plan, method, or preparation, fitting the 'Ideation' definition.
   - It is distinguished from 'Indicator' by the clear suicidal intent and lack of indication that thoughts are unwanted.
   - It does not qualify as 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparations (the rule states: ""If unsure about explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'"").
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent action is described.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes ""tried to kms yesterday"" (where ""kms"" means ""kill myself""), indicating a direct reference to a suicidal action. It also mentions ""depressed af,"" showing emotional distress. The phrase ""tried to kms"" describes a past, self-initiated action. No specific method, plan, or preparation details are provided, but the action itself is stated. The temporal context is ""yesterday,"" making it recent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kms"" (kill myself), which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent. The desire to die is implied through the action described (""tried""), and there is no negation or statement that the thoughts were unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The focus is on the past action itself, not on planning or methods for a future act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday."" This indicates a specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author. Even though it may have been interrupted or failed (implied by ""tried""), it constitutes an actual attempt according to the 'Attempt' definition.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of a past suicidal action (""tried to kms yesterday""), which fits the 'Attempt' category definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions by the author that were potentially lethal."" Although current distress is present (""depressed af""), the mention of a concrete past attempt takes precedence over any potential current ideation or behavior. Since the action was initiated, it is not 'Behavior' (which involves planning without action) or 'Ideation' (desire without action). The explicit suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator'.

56,There has to be a non painful way to do this. I cant. I absolutely cannot fight anymore. This has been non stop for 28 years. Literally non stop pain and suffering. To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme hopelessness and despair (""I cant. I absolutely cannot fight anymore""), anhedonia or inability to endure life (""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years""), and a direct statement of not wanting to live (""I cant live anymore""). The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" implies a consideration of methods for ending life, but it is vague and not specific (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances named). No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) or past actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned. The suffering is described as chronic, but there is no indication of imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The primary sentiment is a personal desire to escape life, not unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I cant live anymore"" is a clear, personal expression of a desire not to be alive, indicating suicidal intent. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no qualifier like ""but I don't want to die""), so this leans toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The mention of ""a non painful way to do this"" alludes to methods, but it is general and speculative, not a specific plan (e.g., no method, tool, location, or preparation is detailed). This vagueness does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior', which requires explicit planning elements. Since no clear plan/method is present, this aligns with 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on ongoing suffering and current feelings, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of initiated attempts, interruptions, or failures). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows a clear, personal desire to die (""I cant live anymore""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which lacks such desire). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no past actions described, 'Attempt' is inapplicable. The vague reference to ""a non painful way"" is insufficient for 'Behavior'; thus, 'Ideation' is the appropriate category. If there were ambiguity about desire, 'Indicator' would be chosen, but the explicit statement of not wanting to live confirms 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I want to kill myself"" and ""do it"" (referring to suicide).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., implying family might be better off) and preparation (""write a suicide note"").
   - Specific method: ""with drugs"" is mentioned.
   - Preparation: ""write a suicide note"" is a clear preparatory step.
   - Temporal context: The plan is future-oriented (""next week""), not immediate. No past actions or attempts are described.
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a genuine wish to die (""I want to kill myself"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a clear desire to die. There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts, so this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned (""with drugs"").
   - Preparation is explicitly stated (""write a suicide note"").
   - This confirms the presence of planning elements, moving beyond mere ideation to 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""next week"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. Therefore, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a method (""with drugs"") and preparation (""write a suicide note"") elevates it from 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method) to 'Behavior'.
   - No concrete, initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Thus, 'Behavior' is the appropriate category due to the combination of suicidal intent, method, and preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions exhaustion, hopelessness (""life is so cyclic,"" ""no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely""), feeling like a burden (""pushing everyone away""), and treatment failure (""none of the pills do enough"").  
   - References envy of others' lives and intense loneliness.  
   - **Key phrase**: ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue."" This implies a desire to end suffering but **lacks explicit suicide/death terminology** (e.g., no ""die,"" ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, death, or direct desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - The phrase ""get this over with"" suggests weariness and a wish to escape distress but is **ambiguous** and not a clear statement of suicidal desire.  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or preparations (e.g., no pills for overdose, no notes).  
   - Reference to ""pills"" relates to medication for illness, not suicidal means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing struggles and future worries (e.g., college, finances).  
   - **No description** of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried X yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Dominant themes are hopelessness, burnout, and distress, but **no explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - Ambiguous phrasing (""get this over with"") leans toward general despair, not active suicidal intent.  
   - **Lacks criteria for Ideation** (no explicit wish to die), **Behavior** (no plan/method), or **Attempt** (no past/recent action).  
   - **Rule application**: When ambiguous about suicidal desire, default to ""Indicator.""

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I have overdosed"" and specifies the method (""I took 500mg Zoloft""), indicating a concrete self-harm action. Emotional indicators include regret, suffering, feeling like a ""nuisance,"" and a desire for suffering to end. The author explicitly states ""I don't want to die,"" showing ambivalence. The action is described as having occurred recently (""It hasn't been that long"") with current physical symptoms (headache). There is no mention of future plans or preparations; the focus is on a completed action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" It expresses a desire for suffering to end but negates a wish to die (""I don't want to die""). Suicidal intent is not clearly present; instead, the action is framed as self-punishment.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned (overdosing on 500mg Zoloft), but this is in the context of a completed action, not a plan or preparation for the future. The post describes the method as part of the past event.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past/recent action: ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" are in past tense, and the author reports current symptoms. This is a specific, self-initiated action (overdose) that was potentially lethal, even though the author downplays the lethality (""it won't kill me""). The action was completed and initiated, fitting the definition of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key factor is the description of a past, concrete, potentially lethal action (overdose), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Despite the author's stated lack of desire to die, the action itself was initiated and could have been harmful. The presence of a method (Zoloft overdose) is part of the action, not mere planning. 'Behavior' is for future-oriented plans/preparations, which are absent here. 'Ideation' is ruled out because thoughts alone are not the focus; an action occurred. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the explicit description of self-harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'm doing it in the near future,"" ""I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" which imply an intention to commit suicide. There is a sense of peace and readiness (""I feel so at peace,"" ""I think I'm ready to go""), indicating emotional resolution. The mention of spending time with a favorite person could be interpreted as preparatory in an emotional sense (e.g., saying goodbye), but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or concrete preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are described. The timeframe is ""near future,"" suggesting imminence but not immediacy. The writer expresses a genuine desire to act, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a personal desire to die through phrases like ""I'm doing it"" and ""I'm ready to go."" The context of feeling ""at peace"" and ""ready"" confirms a genuine wish to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts. Therefore, explicit suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned. The reference to spending time with a favorite person may suggest emotional preparation, but it is not an explicit plan or tangible preparation (e.g., acquiring means). Without any clear plan, method, or preparation details, this aspect aligns more with ideation than behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""in the near future,"" ""I'm going to"") with no description of past actions or attempts. There is no mention of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., a prior suicide attempt), so it does not qualify for the ""Attempt"" category.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die, placing it above ""Indicator"" (which requires no such desire). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or explicit preparation means it does not meet the criteria for ""Behavior."" ""Behavior"" requires even a brief mention of a plan or method, which is not present here. As there are no past actions described, ""Attempt"" is not applicable. Therefore, the best fit is ""Ideation,"" as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and intent without a plan or preparatory elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions past suicidal thoughts (""i was suicidal"") in the context of a negative high school experience. It focuses on frustration with the school's response (e.g., being sent to the principal's office and having grades criticized). There is no mention of death, dying, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include frustration and criticism, but not current hopelessness, despair, or burden. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions are described. The reference to suicidal thoughts is entirely past-tense (""4 yrs ago"") and framed as a memory, not a current state. The writer does not express a current desire to die; instead, they are recounting a past event.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions past suicidal thoughts (""i was suicidal""), but it does not express a current desire to die or commit suicide. The suicidal reference is historical and not attributed to the author's present state. There is no indication that the author currently wants to die or has unwanted suicidal thoughts now—instead, the focus is on the memory of the event. This leans toward 'Indicator' because the suicidal content is not current or personally desired in the present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the past suicidal thoughts. The post only states that the school ""found out"" the author was suicidal, without detailing any actions, methods, or preparations by the author. Since no plan or method is described (past or present), this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event (4 years ago) where the author was suicidal, but it does not describe any specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author (e.g., no mention of an attempt, such as taking pills or self-harming). The phrase ""found out i was suicidal"" suggests disclosure or identification of thoughts, not a concrete action. Therefore, this does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post discusses past suicidal thoughts abstractly and expresses distress about the school's handling of the situation, but it lacks a current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The primary sentiment is frustration with past events, not present ideation. This fits 'Indicator' because the suicidal reference is historical and not indicative of the author's current state. There is no ambiguity about current desire—it is absent—so 'Indicator' is appropriate. 'Ideation' would require a current desire, which is not present, and 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' are not supported due to the lack of plans, methods, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal language: ""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), despair (""unexplainable void and sadness""), self-loathing (""pretty shit person""), and perceived burden (""me being sad is dangerous"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - Describes a persistent desire to die as a solution (""Might as well just die"") but **no reference to past actions or attempts**.  
   - Explicitly states a **genuine wish to die** without negation (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""die"" express a personal desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""i should die,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), feeling like a burden (""they have to support me""), self-loathing, and anger toward family.  
   - Specific suicidal plan/preparation: ""I have prepared everything"" directly follows ""made up my mind to kill myself a few days.""  
   - No description of a past *initiated action* (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). Focus is on current/preparatory intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" and ""i should die"" are direct expressions of a personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I have prepared everything"" explicitly indicates preparations for suicide, even without detailing the method. This qualifies as suicidal behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post references a past decision (""made up my mind a few days [ago]"") and current preparations (""I have prepared everything"").  
   - **No initiated action**: There is no mention of a concrete, past/ongoing lethal act (e.g., ""I tried""). The focus is on planning/preparation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The mention of preparation (""prepared everything"") moves this beyond Ideation to Behavior.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No description of an initiated lethal action (e.g., ingestion, cutting). Preparations alone are Behavior.

I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""vanish without a trace"" and describes a detailed plan involving disappearing, abandoning possessions, and walking to a secluded spot. It explicitly references carrying a pistol with the intent that ""no one will find my body,"" indicating a lethal outcome.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), feeling like a burden (""they never seemed to enjoy my company""), and isolation.  
   - **Specific plan/method**: The author details preparations (emptying bank account, leaving belongings, traveling without traceable items) and a method (using a pistol in a secluded area).  
   - **Temporal context**: The plan is future-oriented (""when that happens,"" ""I will have,"" ""I would want to""). No past actions are described.  
   - **Desire**: The phrase ""vanish without a trace"" coupled with the pistol reference implies a clear intent to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - While ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly stated, ""vanish"" in context (especially with ""no one will find my body"" and the pistol) strongly implies death by suicide. The desire is unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Method**: Explicitly mentions a pistol.  
   - **Preparation**: Describes logistical steps (emptying bank account, leaving belongings, traveling on foot to a secluded area).  
   - **Specificity**: Location (""secluded spot""), tools (""pistol, canteen""), and actions are concrete.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post discusses **future intent** (""when that happens,"" ""I will have""). No past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I tried"") is mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a **desire to die** (implied by vanishing with lethal means) and details a **specific plan/method** (pistol in a secluded area) with **preparations** (financial/logistical steps).  
   - This aligns with **Behavior** (suicidal intent + plan/method/preparation). No initiated action occurred, ruling out ""Attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal desire. It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""life is shit,"" ""I give up now""), despair (""it's all scary,"" ""no one cares""), and personal distress (""I don't recognise myself anymore""). There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. The phrase ""I'm this fucking close"" suggests high distress but does not specify a plan or imminent timeline.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die,"" which is a clear, personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""). This rules out 'Indicator' and points toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., overdose, gun), or preparation is mentioned. The distress is general, and ""I'm this fucking close"" is vague, not indicating a concrete plan. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and desires, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of initiated attempts, even if failed or interrupted). This rules out 'Attempt'.

   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") places this beyond 'Indicator', which requires no clear suicidal intent. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. With no described actions, 'Attempt' is not applicable. The post fits 'Ideation' best, as it expresses a personal suicidal desire without specifics on how or when it might be carried out.

66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal for about 10 years"" and a desire to end existence (""i dont want the existance ive got"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""rotting away""), disconnection, and feeling burdensome.  
   - **Specific plan/method/preparation**:  
     - Mentions a chosen location (""woodland where i would do it"").  
     - Details preparations like leaving notes to warn dog walkers and directing them to call police.  
     - States intent to avoid doing it at home to delay discovery.  
     - Acknowledges pushing people away to facilitate the act.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (""i dont want the existance""), but suicidal thoughts are framed as persistent rather than unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states being ""suicidal"" and ""i do do it"" (referring to suicide).  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a clear desire to escape existence.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not** negated as unwanted; the distress stems from the *persistence* of these feelings, not rejection of the desire itself.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific location (woodland) and preparatory steps (leaving notes for discovery, isolating to enable the act) are described.  
   - Method is implied (e.g., hanging via ""rope"" is referenced but not yet acquired).  
   - Pushing people away is noted as facilitating the plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes chronic suicidal ideation and **current/future** plans (woodland, notes).  
   - **No** mention of past/recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried""). References to childhood self-harm are historical and non-suicidal in intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent are present.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Specific plans/preparations (location, notes, isolation) go beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of initiated, potentially lethal self-harm.  
   - **Behavior**: Clear desire to die **plus** concrete planning (location, discovery logistics) and preparatory steps (isolation).

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense frustration and anger towards the mother for restricting driving privileges despite obtaining a license. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I hate my life,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore""), despair (""everything taken away from me""), and explicit suicidal statements (""I wanna off myself""). No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are mentioned. The suicidal expressions reflect a current desire to die in response to distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I wanna off myself"" (directly implies suicide) and ""I don’t even wanna live anymore"" (clear desire to not be alive).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). Strong personal desire to die is evident.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight""). Suicidal intent is expressed without concrete planning elements.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current emotional state and frustrations. No reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""off myself,"" ""don’t wanna live"") meets **Ideation** criteria.  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No described past/recent suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Personal desire to die distinguishes this from **Indicator** (which requires lack of genuine suicidal intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""suicidal"" (directly states personal suicidal state).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""desperate,"" ""hopeless,"" ""No one cares,"" ""No one will miss me.""  
   - Temporal imminence: ""tonight's the night"" implies immediate intent.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation details (e.g., tools, location, notes).  
   - No description of past actions/attempts.  
   - Writer expresses desire to die implicitly (""stay alive"" as a burden) but does not explicitly negate suicidal thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions being ""suicidal.""  
   - **Yes**: ""tonight's the night I guess"" implies acceptance/desire to act.  
   - **No**: No statement rejecting suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - ""Tonight's the night"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete planning details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on *future* intent (""tonight"").  
   - **No** description of past/current initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried last night"").

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""cutting an artery"" and using ""oxy"" (likely oxycodone) as a method to reduce pain during this act. This directly references a specific, potentially lethal means (artery cutting) and a substance (oxy) that could facilitate the act.
   - Emotional indicators include distress and helplessness, as the author apologizes for the post and states, ""i just don't know who else to ask,"" implying isolation and a cry for help. However, the primary focus is on the method.
   - There is no explicit mention of death, dying, or suicide, but the method described (cutting an artery) is inherently suicidal in context.
   - No specific plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or timeframes (e.g., ""tonight"") are stated. The post is framed as a hypothetical question about pain reduction.
   - The author does not express an explicit desire to die or state that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they are seeking practical information about the method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - It does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die""). The content is inquisitive about the method, not declarative about intent (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are implied but not stated as unwanted; the author is exploring the method without expressing resistance to the idea (No to unwanted thoughts).
   - Due to the lack of explicit suicidal desire, this leans toward 'Indicator', but the specific method mention must be weighed in the next steps.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""cutting an artery"" combined with ""oxy"" to lessen pain. This is a clear, potentially lethal method.
   - No preparations (e.g., ""I have the pills"") are described, but the inquiry about method effectiveness suggests the author is gathering information, which could be part of planning.
   - The presence of a specific method (artery cutting and oxy use) aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as it goes beyond general thoughts to include concrete means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses a potential future action hypothetically (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of trying this before or being interrupted).
   - Since no concrete, self-initiated lethal action is described, this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post lacks an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""), which would be required for 'Ideation'. Instead, it focuses on a method, implying underlying intent but not stating it outright.
   - The specific method mention (cutting an artery with oxy) shifts this from 'Indicator' (general distress) to 'Behavior', as per the definition: even a brief reference to a method constitutes 'Behavior' when combined with implied suicidal context.
   - 'Attempt' is ruled out due to the absence of any described past or recent action.
   - The key distinction: If the method were vague (e.g., ""I want it to end""), it might be 'Ideation', but the specificity here (artery cutting + oxy) confirms 'Behavior'. However, since the desire is not explicit, and the method is discussed in a question, 'Behavior' is still appropriate based on the inclusion of a plan/method element.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses a friend's prediction that the author will die by suicide (""I'm positive I'm going to kill myself""). 
   - The author expresses hurt, betrayal, and relationship conflict stemming from this comment. 
   - There is no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or preparations by the author. Instead, the author states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness"" and focuses on the interpersonal impact of the friend's words. 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions by the author are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Suicide is mentioned, but only as the friend's prediction (""you're going to kill myself""). The author does not express any personal desire to die or current suicidal thoughts. They explicitly frame the friend's comment as hurtful and unjustified. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied by the author. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past conversation (weeks ago) and its emotional aftermath. No actions related to self-harm or suicide initiation are reported. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core content reflects distress about a relationship and stigmatizing comments, not personal suicidal intent. References to suicide are external (friend's words) and rejected by the author. This aligns with **Indicator**, which includes expressions of distress or abstract discussions of suicide without personal desire to die. 
   - There is no evidence of Ideation (author lacks desire to die), Behavior (no plan/method), or Attempt (no initiated action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of self-harm/suicide: ""jump out"" (method) and ""cut the screen"" (preparation).
   - Emotional indicators: desperation (""please help me""), helplessness (""i dont know what to do""), and immediacy (""right now,"" ""about to"").
   - Specific method/preparation: ""scissors"" (tool), ""at my window"" (location), and intent to ""cut the screen and jump out"" (explicit plan).
   - Temporal context: Immediate/imminent (""right now,"" ""about to""). No past actions described—only current intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump out"" strongly implies a lethal action with clear intent to die. The plea for help suggests ambivalence but doesn’t negate the expressed desire to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific method: Jumping from a height.
   - Tools/location: Scissors and window (used to enable the jump).
   - Preparation: Physically at the window with tools, describing imminent action (""about to cut... and jump"").
   - **Conclusion**: Clear plan, method, and preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes an immediate future action (""about to"") but **no past or initiated lethal action**. The writer has not yet cut the screen or jumped—only stating intent to do so imminently.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to act lethally is present.
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific method (jumping), tools (scissors), and preparation (at window) move this beyond mere desire.
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of an *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I cut the screen"" or ""I jumped""). The action is impending but not yet executed.

   - Emotional distress is present (""i have pain everyday,"" ""i don't wanna deal with it"").  
   - The phrase ""i'm gonna"" implies future intent.  
   - No mention of past actions or preparations beyond the stated plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""i'm gonna overdose"" directly expresses intent to self-harm via a lethal method.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""overdose on iron pills"" specifies a method (iron pills are toxic and potentially lethal).

   - Future intent (""gonna"") with a specific plan.  
   - No description of a past/initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal statement: ""im going to kill myself one day.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life. i dont even know what that is""), despair (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), isolation (""no friends, nothing""), anger (""i hate them and my parents""), desire to escape (""run away to a forest and fucking die"").

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to die (e.g., ""I hate being alive,"" ""I want to die,"" ""how much I want to die"") and references suicide directly (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end it all,"" ""assisted suicide""). However, the author explicitly states an inability to act on these thoughts due to a lack of bravery (""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself""). Instead, they express passive wishes for external causes of death, like being murdered or assisted suicide, and describe behaviors such as walking through sketchy areas hoping for harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""losing more hope,"" ""life is so sisyphean""), despair (""crying myself to sleep,"" ""prolonging my suffering""), and feelings of worthlessness (""useless I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive""). There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) for self-initiated suicide. The temporal context focuses on ongoing distress and passive risk-taking (walking in sketchy areas ""every night""), but no description of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no reference to an actual suicide attempt).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and similar phrases, and it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). However, the author also negates the desire to act on these thoughts themselves, framing it as a lack of courage rather than an unwanted thought. This suggests the suicidal desire is present but not accompanied by intent for self-action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for self-initiated suicide is mentioned. References to ""murder"" or ""assisted suicide"" involve external factors beyond the author's control and do not constitute a plan or preparation by the author. Walking through sketchy areas is a passive behavior hoping for harm, not an active suicide plan. Without any explicit plan/method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing feelings and passive behaviors (e.g., walking in sketchy areas regularly) but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions. The mention of ""walking through sketchy areas"" is not a concrete suicidal act; it is indirect risk-taking that has not resulted in harm. There is no indication of an attempt or initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire). However, the lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. No self-initiated actions are described, so it is not an 'Attempt'. The core content involves suicidal ideation with a stated desire to die but no actionable plan, fitting the 'Ideation' category. The passive wishes for external harm do not change this, as the classification focuses on self-initiated suicide risk.

   - Emotional indicators are strong: hopelessness (""I'm not exactly sure why I am here""), feeling unwanted, despair (""I can't take no more""), and derogatory descriptions of life (""shithole"").
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, goodbyes beyond the vague ""See you all"") are mentioned. The ""day count"" (8,000 days) reflects past suffering but does not indicate a concrete plan or timeline for action.
   - There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts; all statements are future-oriented or general expressions of intent.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire for death (""glad I'm going to die"") and even anticipation of pain (""my favorite part is I'll experience it painfully""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it uses euphemisms (""going to die,"" ""leave,"" ""other side"") that strongly imply suicidal intent in context.
   - It expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""glad I'm going to die,"" ""I think I'm going to leave"") without any negation (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator', which requires unwanted thoughts or lack of personal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or means (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned or implied.
   - No preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools) are described; the farewell ""See you all on the other side"" is vague and not tied to concrete actions.
   - Without any plan, method, or preparation, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to die,"" ""I think I'm going to leave"") and general despair, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). The ""day count"" is a reflection, not an imminent threat.
   - Since no initiated, potentially lethal action is mentioned, it cannot be classified as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows a clear personal desire to die, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicidal intent).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - With no description of past actions, it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits 'Ideation': it expresses explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to not be alive (""I want to die"" is implied), but lacks specifics on how or when it would happen. The rules state to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if no explicit plan is present.

Im tired of being a burden to everyone just because of something I can barely help, im tired of getting hurt and blaming myself because in most cases it is my fault. I just am tired of my only source of happiness being inebriated. Im tired of my emotionally abusive mom blaming me for all her problems, or getting mad at me for having a panic attack.

If you read all this thank you for listening to my rant, I truly appreciate it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound emotional distress: sadness, anxiety, hopelessness (""my soul is hurting,"" ""I don't think I can do it anymore""), feeling like a burden, and exhaustion from ineffective treatments.  
   - Mentions a desire to escape (""I just don't wanna be here"") and metaphorical surrender (""wave the white flag"").  
   - Explicitly states conflicted feelings about existence but emphasizes a lingering desire for happiness (""I still want happiness"").  
   - **No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, or methods**. Phrases like ""don't wanna be here"" and ""wave the white flag"" imply despair but lack specificity about suicide.  
   - **No references to plans, preparations, methods, or past actions** related to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die.""  
   - Desires expressed (""don't wanna be here,"" ""wave the white flag"") are **vague and lack clear suicidal intent**; the author explicitly states they still seek happiness.  
   - The tone emphasizes **distress and exhaustion**, not a genuine wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of tools, locations, substances, plans, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current emotional state**, not past actions. References to ""tried every way to cope"" relate to treatments, not suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post centers on **hopelessness and distress** without explicit suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.  
   - Phrases like ""don't wanna be here"" are ambiguous but lean toward **general despair** (especially given the emphasis on wanting happiness).  
   - **No evidence of Ideation** (explicit desire to die), **Behavior** (plan/method), or **Attempt** (past action).  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses severe distress and metaphorical surrender but lacks personal suicidal intent, plan, or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I have to kill myself"" and ""Death is my only option right now.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., ""I have nothing,"" ""My future is fucked,"" ""Nothing is going well,"" ""it isn't getting better"").  
   - There is a clear desire to die: ""I have to kill myself,"" ""Death is my only option,"" and ""It'd be worse staying alive"" indicate a personal wish to end life.  
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, location), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are described.  
   - The temporal context focuses on future intent (""I have to do this"") without immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete steps.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states ""I have to kill myself"" and frames death as the ""only option,"" confirming a personal desire to die. The writer does not express these thoughts as unwanted or negated.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, or preparation is referenced. The post emphasizes desire and rationale but lacks details on how, when, or where suicide would occur.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions but **no past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no mention of trying and failing).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I have to kill myself"") rules out *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - The absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/recent actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - This fits **Ideation**: clear personal desire to die without a plan, method, or preparations.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The author expresses a strong wish to ""donate"" their life to help another person (""I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother""). They explicitly state, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" and frame their desire to die as altruistic (""making lots of people happy""). 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't deserve... to live""), worthlessness (""he deserves a much better life; I don’t""), and anhedonia (implying their life lacks value). 
   - Suicide/death references: Explicit personal desire to die (""I don't want to live""), but no mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The ""donate life"" phrasing is metaphorical, not a concrete plan. 
   - Imminence/temporal context: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). 
   - Desire assessment: The author clearly states a personal wish to die (""I don't want to live""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. The author personally states, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live,"" expressing a direct desire to not be alive. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No. The ""donate life"" concept is abstract/metaphorical. No specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions described. The post focuses on current feelings and hypothetical wishes. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""don't want to live"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**. 
   - Lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
   - No description of past/current self-initiated actions rules out **Attempt**. 
   - The clarity of personal suicidal desire (""don't want to live"") distinguishes this from **Indicator** (which requires ambiguity or explicit rejection of the desire to act).

Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit expressions: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon,"" and passive suicidal intent via hoping to contract COVID to hasten death.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""healing is a joke,"" ""family is a joke""), resignation (""tired of working on healing""), and self-destructive decisions (stopping all medications, quitting therapy, embracing unhealthy habits).  
   - **Methods/preparation**: Mentions stopping medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure) and unhealthy lifestyle choices (soda/junk food) to accelerate death. However, these are passive/indirect methods, not active plans (e.g., no pills/weapons/locations specified). Hoping for COVID is not a self-initiated method.  
   - **Temporal context**: Describes *current* decisions (stopping meds, quitting therapy) but no mention of past actions or imminent future plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" express a personal desire for death. No negation of intent (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No explicit plan/method**: Stopping medications and unhealthy habits imply indirect self-harm but lack specificity (e.g., no dosage, tool, location, or timeline). Hoping for COVID is not a controllable/active method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past or recent *initiated lethal action* (e.g., no ""I took pills"" or ""tried to jump""). Current actions (stopping meds) are preparatory but not overtly life-threatening in isolation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong **desire to die** qualifies for Ideation or higher.  
   - **No plan/method**: Indirect actions (stopping meds) and passive wishes (hoping for illness) do not constitute a specific plan/preparation required for ""Behavior.""  
   - **No initiated lethal action**: Rules out ""Attempt.""  
   - **Distinction from Indicator**: Explicit personal desire for death (""ready to die"") moves this beyond general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets criteria for **Ideation** (explicit desire to die without clear plan/method).

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to ""disappear"" and be ""free from all this pain,"" indicating emotional distress, hopelessness, and a sense of brokenness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, or preparations. No references to past actions or imminent timelines are present. The core sentiment is a plea for relief from suffering, but it does not explicitly state a wish to die or commit suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. Phrases like ""disappear"" or ""be free from pain"" could imply a desire for non-existence, but they are vague and not unambiguously tied to death. There is no clear expression of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), nor is there any indication that such thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Due to this ambiguity, it leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content focuses solely on emotional suffering without actionable elements for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current state of distress with no references to past or recent suicidal actions. No initiated, potentially lethal behaviors are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows distress and hopelessness but lacks an explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide. Phrases like ""disappear"" are not definitive of suicidal intent and could represent a metaphorical escape. With ambiguity in suicidal desire, the guidance is to choose 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. No plan/method or past actions support 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.  
   - The phrase ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" expresses a personal desire to die, framed as a rhetorical question.  
   - The postscript ""I just need a plan for suicide"" explicitly references the *act of planning* a suicide method.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm).  
   - Emotional distress is evident, but the focus is on active suicidal planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" confirming a personal desire to die. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, the author explicitly states they ""need a plan for suicide,"" indicating active preparation. While no *specific* method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, the act of seeking/forming a plan qualifies as preparatory behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses *future* intentions (""need a plan"") with no description of past/current actions (e.g., ""I tried last night"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and active planning (""need a plan for suicide"") align with **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: While ""kill myself"" alone could suggest Ideation, the added planning element moves it to Behavior.  
   - No concrete past/current action (e.g., overdose) is described, ruling out Attempt.  
   - The absence of unwanted thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts"") rules out Indicator.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I'm going to kill myself"" (explicit suicidal phrase), ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (linked to a ""most recent failed attempt""), ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and gestures mimicking suicide (finger gun to mouth).  
   - References a **past suicide attempt** (""most recent failed attempt"").  
   - Emotional tone: Distress about intrusive thoughts/gestures, seeking relatability.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Describes a past suicide attempt (""failed attempt"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method implied via finger-gun gesture (mimicking firearm suicide), but this is symbolic.  
   - **No active plan/preparation** for future suicide; focus is on *past action* and intrusive thoughts.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key finding**: Describes a **concrete past action** (""most recent failed attempt"").  
   - This was a potentially lethal, self-initiated act (stopped/interrupted).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempt (""failed attempt"") takes precedence over current intrusive thoughts/gestures.  
   - Rules: A described past attempt (even if failed/interrupted) qualifies as **'Attempt'**, regardless of current ideation/behavior.  
   - Intrusive phrases/gestures alone would be 'Behavior' (method implied), but the explicit reference to a **concrete past action** overrides this.

The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal"" directly express a personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

   - No preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) or past actions (e.g., prior attempts) are described.
   - The phrase ""kill myself now"" indicates a desire for immediate relief but lacks concrete details about implementation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" confirming a personal desire to die. The phrase ""I don't want it [life]"" reinforces this intent. There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"" (specific method: firearm).
    - Emotional indicators: Fear (""I'm scared""), conflict (""I don't want to leave my cats/friends""), persistent urges (""every single day I still have the urge""), self-criticism (""too much of a pussy"").
    - Plan/method: ""blow my brains out"" and ""pull the trigger"" imply firearm use, but **no explicit preparation** (e.g., acquiring a gun, loading it) is described.
    - Action: No past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., ""tried to pull the trigger"" would qualify). The author states they ""can never bring [themself] to actually do it.""
    - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") but with ambivalence (fear, attachment to pets/friends). The suicidal thoughts are persistent but actively resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out."" The author expresses a personal desire to die, despite conflicting feelings.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Method: **Yes** (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"" = firearm).  
    - Preparation: **No**. No mention of obtaining a gun, writing notes, or other concrete steps.  
    - *Result*: Method is specified, but absence of preparation or explicit planning leans toward *Ideation* under the rules (if unsure, choose Ideation over Behavior).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes **current/future urges** (""every single day,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out"") but **no past/initiated action**. The author explicitly states inability to act (""can never bring myself to actually do it""). No qualifying event for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - Suicidal **desire is explicit** (ruling out *Indicator*).  
    - A **specific method (firearm) is mentioned**, but no plan/preparation is described. Rules specify: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Here, the method is stated abstractly (""blow my brains out"") without evidence of actionable planning (e.g., ""I have a gun ready"").  
    - **No initiated action** (ruling out *Attempt*).  
    - *Ideation* best fits: Explicit desire to die + specific method referenced, but no plan/preparations confirmed.

   - **No specific plan/method/preparation by the author**. The request for someone else to murder them does not constitute a *personal* plan/method for suicide (e.g., no self-initiated tools, locations, or preparations).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/current self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempting overdose or self-harm). The post focuses on a plea for future external intervention.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No—explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Ideation?** Yes—clear desire to die (""kill me,"" ""end my life"") but **no personal plan/method/preparation**. The request for murder is an appeal for external action, not a self-devised suicide plan.  
   - **Behavior?** No—no mention of the author’s own plan, method (e.g., ""I will use X to kill myself""), or preparations.  
   - **Attempt?** No—no description of a past/recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action.  
   - **Key distinction**: While the post urges action from others, the author expresses suicidal intent without detailing a *personal* plan or method, placing it in 'Ideation'.

87,"I'm about to get fired, my boss hates me, and I deserve it. I'm 21, and I graduated college in December. My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts. I feel like I wasn't allowed a normal childhood, and I've spent my whole life trying to avoid being 'trapped,' but every time I make progress, I wind up worse off than before. I haven't been afraid of dying in a long time. I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen. But I don't see a way out, and I often feel things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore :/",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions significant distress: job insecurity, family issues, isolation, hopelessness (""I don't see a way out""), and passive acceptance of death (""I haven't been afraid of dying"").  
   - Explicitly negates suicidal action: ""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen.""  
   - Expresses emotional burden: ""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore"" reflects despair but frames it as exhaustion, not active intent.  
   - No references to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct desire to die.  
   - Death is acknowledged passively (""not afraid of dying""), but the author explicitly rejects causing it (""deliberately make it happen"").  
   - The closest sentiment (""things would be better if I didn't have to try"") leans toward hopelessness, not a wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress but **no past or recent self-harm actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Distress and hopelessness are present, but there is **no personal expression of a desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts**. The author explicitly disavows self-harm.  
   - Falls under **Indicator** due to:  
     - Abstract references to death without personal intent.  
     - Explicit rejection of self-harm.  
     - Dominant themes are hopelessness and emotional overwhelm, not suicidal ideation.  
   - Rule: Ambiguity between Indicator/Ideation defaults to Indicator.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" explicitly.  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""i can't keep getting false hope""), despair (""crushed and empty""), anhedonia (""neutral feeling"" contrasted with current pain).  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or initiated actions.  
   - Temporal context: Focuses on current emotional state (""today,"" ""now"") and recurring thoughts.  
   - Desire to die is indirectly implied (""thought about suicide"") but conflicted (""maybe i can power through"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""  
   - **Yes**: Implies desire to escape pain (""i just want to collapse and let go""), but no direct ""I want to die"" statement.  
   - **No**: The writer expresses distress about thoughts but does not explicitly negate the desire (e.g., ""but I don't want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, goodbyes), or timelines.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No**: Describes ongoing thoughts and emotional pain, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thoughts"") and desire to escape pain.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Strong suicidal ideation is present (""suicidal thoughts get stronger""), conflicting with ambivalence (""maybe I can power through"").  
   - **Leans 'Ideation'**: Explicit desire to die is inferable from context, and thoughts are persistent/personalized.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention: ""planning to kill myself tonight"" directly states suicidal intent with a specific timeframe (""tonight"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Everyone who could help me is asleep,"" ""This is my problem...""), acceptance (""I expect nothing from no one""), and farewell (""Rest In Peace"").
   - Plan/timing: Clear future plan (""tonight"") but no specific method (e.g., pills, weapon) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring tools) mentioned.
   - Desire: Unambiguous personal desire to die (""kill myself"") without negation (e.g., no statement of not wanting to act).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct phrase expressing a clear desire to die. No indication these thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A plan is explicitly stated (""planning to kill myself tonight""), but no method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are described. ""Tonight"" indicates temporal immediacy but doesn’t specify means. Thus, this meets the threshold for 'Behavior' due to the explicit plan + timeframe.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a future intention (""tonight""), not a past action. No evidence of initiated lethal behavior (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + explicit plan (""tonight"") qualifies as 'Behavior', even without method details. Falls short of 'Attempt' (requires initiated action). Not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit) or 'Ideation' (plan is present).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" as the only solution to the author's suffering and guilt. Key phrases include: ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing,"" ""I don't belong here,"" and ""I need to leave"" (strongly implying a desire to cease existing).  
   - Emotional indicators are clear: intense guilt (""suffer extraordinary pain for decisions I’ve made""), hopelessness (""only thing that suffices""), and alienation (""I don’t belong here"").  
   - No specific plans, methods (tools/locations/substances), preparations (e.g., note-writing), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (framing suicide as necessary), not distress about *unwanted* thoughts.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly uses ""suicide"" and ties it to a personal need (""I need to leave""). The desire to die is clear and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. Suicide is referenced abstractly as a solution, without details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""I’m starting to think""). No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post has explicit suicidal desire (""suicide is the only thing"") and personal ownership of the intent (""I need to leave""), ruling out **Indicator**.  
   - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - This fits **Ideation**: explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts without a plan, method, or preparation.

Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""hanging myself"" as a specific suicide method and describes ""practicing"" it. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""My life is fucked now,"" ""There's no turning it around""), worthlessness (""I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die""), and anhedonia (""Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy""). There is clear preparation through repeated practice (""I've been practicing,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing"") to overcome the ""natural survival instinct."" The desire for death is strong and desired (""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""the thought makes me so happy""). Imminence is implied with ""soon,"" but no specific timeframe. The author expresses a genuine wish to die and actively resists intervention (""I don't want anyone to take this away from me"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""hanging myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I can't wait for the day when I finally do it,"" ""I will succeed""). The suicidal thoughts are wanted, not unwanted distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (hanging) is mentioned, and there are explicit preparations (""practicing hanging myself,"" ""I'm going to keep practicing,"" ""train myself""). This indicates active, ongoing behavior beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past actions (""I practiced"") and ongoing/future intentions (""I'm going to keep practicing,"" ""finally do it""). The past action of practicing hanging is a preparatory behavior but not described as a potentially lethal attempt (e.g., no indication it was intended to cause death at that time; it was training for a future act). The focus is on preparation, not a completed or interrupted lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire, moving it beyond 'Indicator'. A specific method and preparations are present, so it is not 'Ideation'. The past action of practicing is preparatory and not described as an actual suicide attempt (it was training, not an initiated lethal act), so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Instead, the combination of desire, method, and preparation aligns with 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing (""I know I'm a piece of shit""), despair (""I feel like one day I will hurt someone""), and hopelessness (""I want to die. I want to disappear"").  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I want to die"" and ""one day I will take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone"" (framed as self-removal to prevent harm).  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Temporal context is future-oriented (""one day"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I want to die"" is a direct personal expression of a desire to die. ""Take myself away from here"" implies suicide as a solution.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: The phrase ""take myself away from here"" is vague. No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, or preparations are specified.

   - Focuses on future intent (""one day"") with no mention of past/current suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (""I want to die""), qualifying for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling ""like trash,"" hopelessness (""I don't have any purpose,"" ""I feel like disappointment""), and explicitly states ""I just don't want to exist.""  
   - **Crucially, denies suicidal intent**: ""I'm not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish.""  
   - No references to death/dying methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Focuses on distress, anxiety, and existential dread.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings (past week) without imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or desire to die.  
   - ""Don't want to exist"" is tempered by denial of being suicidal and calling suicide ""selfish,"" framing thoughts as unwanted/unacted-upon distress.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **None present**. No tools, locations, plans, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

   - Lack of explicit death wish, plan, method, preparation, or action aligns with **Indicator**. Ambiguity in ""don't want to exist"" is resolved by the author’s direct denial of suicidality.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes expressions of hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness""), worthlessness (""useless,"" ""no use to society""), and a clear desire for death (""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life"").  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""taking my life,"" ""I want to take my life,"" and ""suicidal"" are directly stated.  
   - A **past suicide attempt** is described in detail: ""I attempted suicide last week,"" including preparations (drafting a note) and the outcome (failure).  
   - Current emotional distress is noted, but no specific *new* plan/method/preparation for future suicide is mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the author explicitly states a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to take my life"") and references personal suicidal thoughts without negation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No *current* plan/method/preparation is indicated. The only method/preparation references (e.g., drafting a note) are tied to the **past attempt**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: ""I attempted suicide last week."" This action was initiated but failed (""my attempt had failed"").  
   - The attempt occurred recently (""last week""), and the aftermath is discussed.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post revolves around a **past suicide attempt** (explicitly stated and described).  
   - While current ideation is present, the **ATTEMPT** category takes precedence per rules, as it describes a historic/recent lethal action by the author.  
   - Rules specify: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""valium"" (a substance) and asks ""how much... to kill you,"" indicating a specific method for suicide.
   - It includes emotional distress with ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" and ""I just want this nightmare to end,"" expressing despair and a desire for relief through death.
   - There is a reference to a possible past action: ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" implies the author may have already ingested valium with suicidal intent.
   - The temporal context is immediate, as ""haven't taken enough"" suggests a recent or ongoing action.
   - The author's stated desire (""I just want this nightmare to end"") appears genuine and personal, with no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill you"" in a context directed at the self (implied by ""I""), and expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""I just want this nightmare to end.""

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (valium overdose) is mentioned. The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" strongly implies that preparation (ingesting valium) has already occurred, indicating an initiated action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a potentially lethal action that has been initiated (""haven't taken enough""), making it a concrete, self-initiated act. Even if insufficient or failed, this qualifies as a past/recent attempt under the 'Attempt' definition.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of a specific method and implied action (ingesting valium) rules out 'Indicator' (no explicit desire) and 'Ideation' (no plan/method).
   - While 'Behavior' could apply to planning, the description of an initiated action (""haven't taken enough"") shifts this to 'Attempt', as it involves a potentially lethal act that has been carried out, even if incomplete or ineffective.
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence here due to the clear reference to self-initiated action with lethal intent.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions multiple past suicide attempts: swallowing sleeping pills at age 16 (with a suicide note), cutting their neck with a razor in November 2020, and overdosing on prescriptions later that same month. Specific methods (pills, razor, overdose) and preparations (suicide note) are described.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to live at all"") and frustration at surviving (""I just don't die"").  
   - The motorcycle incident is framed as accidental, not suicidal.  
   - No current plan, method, or imminent intent is expressed; the focus is on recounting past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, phrases like ""suicide attempts"" and descriptions of self-harm actions confirm a past desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Past methods (pills, razor, overdose) and preparation (suicide note) are explicitly detailed, but these relate to **completed past actions**, not current plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **past, concrete, potentially lethal actions** initiated by the author: swallowing pills, cutting their neck, and overdosing. These were physically carried out (even if they failed), meeting the 'Attempt' criteria. The motorcycle crash is unrelated to suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post details **multiple past suicide attempts** with specific methods and outcomes.  
   - While current distress is evident (""I don't want to live""), there is no mention of a new plan, method, or imminent intent.  
   - Per the rules: Past potentially lethal actions take precedence over current ideation/behavior. Describing concrete attempts qualifies as 'Attempt'.

Tell me why I should. I just need someone to push me one more inch.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""I put a belt around my neck,"" ""sat down against the doorknob,"" ""right before I passed out,"" ""I stopped,"" ""I’m so close to just doing it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""all failing,"" ""ready to be done""), despair (""started crying""), burden (""ruin my life"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Belt around the neck, using a doorknob for leverage.  
   - Action described: Initiated self-strangulation (""sat down against the doorknob""), stopped only ""right before I passed out.""  
   - Imminence: ""tonight,"" ""I’m so close to just doing it.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""Tell me why I shouldn’t kill myself"" and ""I’m ready to be done"" express a clear desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (belt around the neck, doorknob) and preparation (executing the act).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent initiated action** (""tonight""): Applied pressure via the belt until near-unconsciousness, then stopped. This is a concrete, potentially lethal self-initiated act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **recent, self-initiated action** with a lethal method (strangulation), stopped only moments before loss of consciousness. This fits the **Attempt** definition (initiated potentially lethal action, interrupted by self). Current distress/ideation (""so close to doing it"") is secondary to the described attempt.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include fear (""scared,"" ""too scared"") and exhaustion with life (""too tired of life""), but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden statements beyond this.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The reference to suicide being illegal and consequences of failure is a deterrent, not a plan.
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the context is hypothetical and general.
   - The writer states a desire to not be alive (""too tired of life"") but couples it with fear of acting (""too scared to kill myself""), indicating conflicted feelings. The ""fun"" at the end may imply sarcasm or resignation, but it doesn't negate the underlying distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a desire to not be alive (""too tired of life"") in a context of despair.
   - While the writer states fear of acting (""too scared to kill myself""), they do not explicitly say the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they lack a desire to die (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""). The fear acts as a barrier, but the desire itself is present. Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means). The discussion of legal consequences is a deterrent, not a plan.
   - Since no plan, method, or preparation is present, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and hypothetical scenarios (""if I fail""), not past or recent actions.
   - No initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so it cannot be 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a personal desire to die (""too tired of life"") and explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""), meeting the 'Ideation' definition.
   - However, there is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The fear and legal concerns are barriers to action but do not negate the desire.
   - While the fear creates some ambiguity, the explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to not be alive aligns with 'Ideation'. The rule states: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" But here, the desire is explicit (e.g., ""too tired of life"" directly implies a wish to not be alive), so 'Ideation' is more appropriate. No past actions indicate 'Attempt'.

This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and existential despair (""rotting away,"" ""miserable lives,"" ""human life has no fucking purpose""). It explicitly references a future action: ""I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good,"" indicating a specific timeframe (April) and intent to end life. No explicit method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named, but ""end this bullshit for good"" strongly implies suicide. There is no mention of past actions or preparations like notes/means acquisition. The phrase ""this will be my second to last post"" signals anticipation of finality.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. ""End this bullshit for good"" is a direct expression of intent to end life, framed as a personal resolution. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. A **specific plan** is stated: ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit."" While the method is not detailed, the trip’s explicit purpose (""to end this"") constitutes preparation and a contextual plan (e.g., traveling to a location to act). This elevates it beyond mere ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes a **future intention** (""in April"") with no mention of past/initiated actions. Thus, it does not describe an *attempt*.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""end this"") confirms *Ideation* or higher.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The specific plan (""trip in April to end this"") and contextual preparation (announcing a final post) meet *Behavior* criteria.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated lethal action (past or present) → not *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" – expresses explicit desire for death via specific methods (overdose, accident).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one left to turn to""), anhedonia (""no motivation""), despair (""fucked myself over""), isolation.  
   - Specific methods: ""od on meds"" (overdose) and ""get hit by a car"" are named.  
   - No explicit plan/preparations (e.g., no ""I will take pills tonight"").  
   - No past actions described; focuses on current wishes.  
   - Desire to die is clearly stated (""wish I could..."") without negation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""od on meds"" implies suicidal intent.  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds..."" shows active wish for death.  
   - No indication thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Methods mentioned (""od on meds,"" ""hit by a car"") but no plan (timing, acquisition) or preparations (e.g., ""I have pills"").  
   - Methods are hypothetical (""wish"") rather than active planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes current feelings/wishes, not past actions.  
   - No initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to OD"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No – explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Ideation?** Core requirement met: Explicit desire to die (""wish I could..."") and suicidal thoughts (OD/car). No plan/prep, so not Behavior.  
   - **Behavior?** Methods are mentioned, but no plan/preparation implied (""wish"" is hypothetical, not actionable).  
   - **Attempt?** No – no past/recent initiated actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Falls under **Ideation** – clear desire to die with suicidal methods referenced, but no plan/prep.

Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way.

I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense anger, resentment, and despair about the author's physical appearance (""ugly person's body""), feeling unwanted, and perceived life disadvantages. 
    - Key emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""daily torture""), envy (""I would give absolutely everything... to have been born that way""), and anhedonia (implied by contrasting their reality with the hypothetical joy of being attractive).
    - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The phrase ""jump out of bed"" is metaphorical (enthusiasm for life if attractive), not literal.  
    - The core sentiment is profound distress about life circumstances, not a stated wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalents.  
    - **No expression of a desire to die** (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). The focus is on wishing to *be different* (""born that way""), not to cease existing.  
    - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Describes ongoing despair and hypothetical scenarios (""I would...""), but **no description of past or imminent concrete actions** related to self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and self-loathing but **lacks explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or actions**.  
    - The anger and focus on life injustice (""appearance... biggest difference in ones life"") align with general despair, not suicidal intent.  
    - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses deep distress without current personal suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

102,'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""me being suicidal"" and explicitly states past actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times."" It also includes emotional indicators like frustration (""I'm tired of people's ignorance"") and references to abuse and severe mental illness. There is no mention of a current plan, method, or preparation for suicide; the focus is on past attempts and how others dismiss the user's experiences.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a personal history of suicidal thoughts and actions. However, there is no clear expression of a *current* desire to die. The user is recounting past events and expressing distress about others' reactions, not stating a present wish to commit suicide.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""tried to kill myself"" describes past actions without detailing methods or preparations for any imminent act. This absence of current planning elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past events: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" clearly refers to specific, self-initiated, and potentially lethal actions that occurred in the past. These are concrete suicide attempts, even if they failed or were interrupted. There is no indication of current or future intentions, plans, or imminent actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the description of multiple past suicide attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition. This takes precedence over any general references to being suicidal, as the past actions are clearly described and were potentially lethal. There is no evidence of current ideation or behavior (e.g., no plan or preparation mentioned), and the emotional distress about others' ignorance does not override the concrete history of attempts. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the most appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""better off dead,"" which relates to death, but it's presented in a rhetorical context contrasting societal advice. There are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators include frustration or irony, but not clear hopelessness or despair. The phrase is used to highlight a perceived double standard, not to express a personal desire. The "":D"" suggests sarcasm, and there's no indication of imminence or genuine suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""I'm better off dead"" implies a wish to not be alive, but it's framed as a reported statement in a comparative context, not a current personal desire. The writer does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted, but the rhetorical nature and "":D"" indicate it's not a genuine expression of intent. Ambiguity suggests leaning towards 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content focuses on verbal expression, not planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a general pattern of what the author says and how others react, not a past, current, or future suicidal action. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress about societal reactions but lacks a clear, current, personal desire to die. The mention of ""better off dead"" is abstract and rhetorical, not an explicit suicidal thought with intent. Due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, per the rules, this falls under 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit desire) and has no elements of 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions specific method: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" (overdose as method). 
   - Physical symptoms described: stomach pain, sweating, shaking, indicating ongoing effects of the overdose.
   - Expresses ambivalence: ""i dont think i want to die"" but also states ""i did this to myself."" 
   - Refers to a past/recent self-initiated action: Took pills an hour ago. 
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like a burden,"" hesitation to seek help. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but overdose is an implied suicidal method. 
   - Desire is conflicted: States not wanting to die now, but the action was self-initiated with potentially lethal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - Specific method and quantity: ""44 paracetamol."" 
   - Action already taken: Pills were ingested an hour prior. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes a **concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (taking 44 pills) that occurred very recently (""almost an hour ago""). 
   - Physical symptoms confirm the action was initiated and is ongoing. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core event is a **past/recent self-initiated action** (overdose) with potentially lethal consequences. 
   - This meets the 'Attempt' definition: A specific, potentially lethal act was initiated by the author, regardless of current ambivalence or outcome. 
   - 'Behavior' would apply if planning/preparation without action; here, action has occurred. 
   - 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' are ruled out due to the concrete, initiated act.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post states ""I want to end it,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide, indicating a personal desire to die. It repeats this desire but explicitly adds ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" showing no specific plan, method, preparation, or timeline. There are no emotional indicators beyond the suicidal intent (e.g., no hopelessness, burden, etc.), no references to past actions, and no imminence (e.g., ""soon""). The writer expresses a clear wish to die but no details on execution.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes, ""I want to end it"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire, equivalent to ""I want to kill myself."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). The primary sentiment is a personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The post explicitly denies any knowledge of ""how, when or anything else,"" so there is no plan indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes a current desire with no reference to past or recent actions. It does not mention any initiated suicidal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""), so it cannot be classified as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post expresses an explicit personal desire to die (""I want to end it""), meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'. However, it lacks any plan, method, or preparation (explicitly stated as ""no idea how""), so it does not qualify for 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' because the desire is clear and not framed as unwanted distress about thoughts. It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent action is described. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions distress: ""vicious cycle of highs and lows,"" ""can't handle it anymore,"" ""exhausted,"" ""feel nothing,"" ""overloading,"" ""hopeless.""
    - Expresses emotional pain: feeling unheard (""I just want someone to care""), isolation (""no one realizes how bad I am""), self-criticism (""my jackass of a brain"").
    - **No explicit references** to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.
    - Focuses on emotional suffering and frustration with mental state (""I know I should be fine but I'm not""), without expressing a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions past struggles: bipolar diagnosis, feeling lonely/lost, past ""rock bottom"" involving severe depression, bipolar breakdowns, almost being abusive, and physical symptoms (puking daily). 
    - References ""death"" abstractly: ""...there's nothing lower but death"" as part of a general reflection on hitting rock bottom. 
    - No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or desire to die. 
    - Emotional indicators: loneliness, fear of being manipulative, but also acceptance, hope (""it might get better""), and encouragement to others (""stay positive and stay safe"").
    - No plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for self-harm/suicide. 
    - Past actions described (depression/breakdowns) are not framed as suicidal acts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear personal desire to die. 
    - The mention of ""death"" is metaphorical/philosophical (""nothing lower but death"") and not a personal expression of intent. 
    - No indication of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted). 
    - **Conclusion**: No explicit suicidal intent. Leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

    - **Conclusion**: Absence reinforces 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes past struggles (""rock bottom"" 2+ years ago) but frames them as non-actionable mental health episodes (breakdowns, puking). 
    - No description of past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to overdose""). 
    - **Conclusion**: No evidence of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

108,"plan on ending it soon. i dont know what else to do and i am overwhelmed by guilt just from the thought, i wish i could apologize a million times to my girlfriend and family but they would just be pissed off at me. i dont know if overdosibg on ibuprofen is painful or would work but thats likely my go-to plan. i dont know when, tonight or this week, or even anytime soon. pain scares me too much.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a plan to end life (""plan on ending it soon""), emotional distress (overwhelmed by guilt, fear of others' reactions), and a specific method (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"" as the ""go-to plan""). Temporal context is uncertain (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon""), and there is fear of pain, but no indication of past actions or preparations beyond the stated plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post directly expresses a personal desire to die through phrases like ""plan on ending it soon,"" which implies suicidal intent. There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to act on them; instead, the guilt and fear are presented as barriers, not negations of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""overdosibg on ibuprofen"") and explicitly tied to the author's plan (""thats likely my go-to plan""). There is no mention of concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), but the reference to a method qualifies this for 'Behavior' per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions (""plan on ending it soon"") with uncertain imminence. There is no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of having taken pills or attempted self-harm). Thus, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die (suicidal ideation) and specifies a method (ibuprofen overdose), moving this beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. The presence of a plan/method is explicit, and there is no ambiguity about the author's personal intent. Fear of pain and guilt do not override the expressed plan or method. No past attempt is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

109,I Relapsed After Almost Two Years. I don't want to get into details but I think I have an addiction to extreme pornography and have had it since I was a kid. Last night/this morning I relapsed and now I feel like shit. If I had a gun I'd kill myself because I know how this goes for me and right now I'm not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future. I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating suicidal intent. The method specified is ""gun"" in the phrase ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I feel like shit,"" ""not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future,"" and feeling ""born/meant to be fucked up""). There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) or a specific timeline for action. The relapse refers to pornography addiction, not a suicidal act, and no past or recent suicidal actions are described. The desire to die is expressed hypothetically, conditional on having access to a gun.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" showing a personal desire to die. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (""gun"") is mentioned in relation to suicidal intent. However, this is conditional (""If I had a gun""), and there is no evidence of preparation (e.g., obtaining a gun or making plans). The mention of a method leans toward 'Behavior', but the hypothetical nature introduces some uncertainty.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses a past relapse (addiction-related, not suicidal) and current/future despair, but no initiated suicidal actions are described. The suicidal thought is conditional and not tied to a specific time frame (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). This does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires a concrete, past or recent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'd kill myself"") with a specific method mentioned (""gun"") aligns with 'Behavior', as the definition includes mentioning a method, even briefly. However, the conditional phrasing (""If I had"") and lack of preparation create ambiguity. Per the rules, if unsure about an explicit plan/method, 'Ideation' should be chosen over 'Behavior'. But here, the method is explicitly stated, and 'Behavior' is defined to include such mentions. Thus, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the author expresses desire and specifies a means, even if hypothetical.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and explicitly states ""i just wanna kill myself,"" indicating personal suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness about the smoking situation, feelings of being trapped (""i cant avoid it""), despair about health (""my lungs are destroyed,"" ""im gonna get lung cancer""), and concern for a sibling. There is no mention of a specific suicide method, plan, or preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note). The context is avoiding future suffering from cancer, but no temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The desire to die is expressed as a way to escape anticipated pain, without evidence of it being unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself,"" which are direct phrases indicating a personal desire to die. The author states ""i just wanna kill myself"" as a genuine wish to avoid future suffering, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not intend to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks details about means or steps. Without any indication of planning or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a desire to die to prevent future events (lung cancer), but it does not reference any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an attempt, interrupted action, or failure). The focus is on thoughts and emotions, not concrete actions, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die (""i just wanna kill myself"") and references ""suicidal thoughts,"" which fits 'Ideation'. However, there is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The absence of any past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. The explicit suicidal intent distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which would apply if the thoughts were unwanted or if suicide was discussed abstractly without personal desire. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

I plan on doing it next week and i'm excited to finally move on from this worthless existence. These past years have shit and i hope I don't get cold feet. Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and describes having a specific plan to end their life. Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness (""worthless existence""), despair (""these past years have been shit""), and a resolved desire to die (""excited to finally move on""). There is a clear future intention (""I plan on doing it next week"") and a goodbye message, which may imply preparation. However, no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or physical preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed. The desire to die is personal and not presented as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""suicide plan"" and ""kill myself."" It expresses a clear, current desire to die (e.g., ""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A plan is explicitly mentioned multiple times (""I've got a suicide plan,"" ""finally got a plan,"" ""I plan on doing it next week""). Although no specific method or tool is described, the presence of a defined plan and timeline (""next week"") constitutes a planning element. The goodbye message (""Goodbye reddit"") could be seen as a preparatory step, but the explicit plan is sufficient to lean toward 'Behavior'. Since the plan is stated, this is not 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""next week"") with no mention of past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., taking pills, self-harming). Thus, this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit suicidal desire and a stated plan, meeting the criteria for 'Behavior'. While the method is not detailed, the plan itself is explicit and future-oriented. This distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan) and 'Attempt' (which requires initiated action). 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the clear personal desire to die.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""long history of depression and suicidal thoughts"" and a past suicide attempt (""attempted suicide in the past, many years ago"").
   - States current resurgence of suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again"").
   - Expresses distress, guilt, and hopelessness related to chronic pain and feeling like a burden (""I feel like a piece of crap,"" ""my wife feels powerless"").
   - No mention of current suicidal desire, plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline. Focus is on seeking support and guilt about communication struggles.
   - Explicitly discusses active steps to get help (setting up appointments, confiding in friends/wife).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned as recurring but framed in the context of past experiences and current distress, not as a current desire to die. The writer emphasizes seeking help and trying to follow through with appointments. No phrases like ""I want to die now"" or ""I will kill myself"" appear.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. References to past attempts lack current planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The suicide attempt is explicitly stated as historical (""many years ago""). No recent or initiated self-harm actions are described. Current focus is on emotional struggles and help-seeking.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress, guilt, and hopelessness, alongside a history of suicidal thoughts/attempts. However, it lacks a *current, personal expression of desire to die*. Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but not framed as a present intent, and the writer actively discusses help-seeking. No plan/method/preparation exists for current behavior. The core issue is emotional conflict about communication, not active suicidality. Fits **Indicator** (distress with unwanted thoughts/history, no current desire/plan).

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of disconnection (""don't feel like a person anymore""), social isolation, fear of abandonment by the boyfriend, and an inability to share struggles. Key elements include:
   - Emotional distress: Hopelessness (""It's getting to be too much""), feeling like a burden (""afraid he won't want baggage like me"").
   - Mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) but explicitly states inability to act on them (""can't even cut because my bf will see""). 
   - No references to death, dying, suicide, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. Self-harm (sh) is framed as a coping mechanism, not a suicidal act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""want to die,"" ""end my life""). 
   - ""Thoughts of sh"" relate to self-harm, not suicide. The author expresses distress but no personal wish for death. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of a suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means). Self-harm is discussed but not as part of a suicidal plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no reference to an attempt). Self-harm is described as avoided, not acted upon. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core themes are emotional distress, isolation, and fear of losing relationships. Self-harm thoughts are present but explicitly unwanted (avoided due to fear of discovery). 
   - **No desire to die or suicidal intent** is expressed, ruling out 'Ideation'. Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No past/current suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Falls under **'Indicator'**: Distress, hopelessness, and unwanted self-harm thoughts without personal suicidal desire.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions death explicitly with phrases like ""when I die,"" ""my pain is finally over,"" and ""if I'm dead."" It expresses emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair by framing death as the only solution to end pain and achieve happiness. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). No past actions or attempts are described, and there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The author's desire to die is presented as genuine and necessary for happiness, with no suggestion that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through statements like ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This shows a clear wish for death as a relief from suffering. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no mention of not wanting these thoughts), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is on the abstract concept of death as an escape, not on how or when it might be carried out. Without any planning elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses death in a future-oriented, hypothetical context (e.g., ""when I die""), but there is no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt). It is solely focused on thoughts and desires, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die, which aligns with 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method). The lack of planning elements rules out 'Behavior', and the absence of any described past or recent self-initiated lethal actions rules out 'Attempt'. While the post conveys distress, the clear suicidal desire means it is not merely an 'Indicator' of general distress. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""my life is all downhill,"" ""career dreams are ruined,"" ""I'll never have kids,"" ""I have nothing in my life""), despair (""I don't care about anything anymore""), and a clear desire not to live (""I don't want to live""). The phrase ""take the leap"" is idiomatic and could imply action, but no specific method, tool, location, or substance is mentioned (e.g., no details like pills, a bridge, or a weapon). Preparations are not explicitly described, though ""goodbye"" may hint at farewell, but it's not tied to concrete actions like writing a note or acquiring means. The temporal context is future-oriented (""finally decided,"" ""goodbye""), suggesting imminent intent, but no specific time frame (e.g., ""tonight"") is given. The author states a decision to act but does not describe any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried but failed""). The desire to die is explicit and personal, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide. It also expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I don't want to live""). There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to""). Thus, explicit intent is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned. ""Take the leap"" is vague and metaphorical; it does not specify a plan (e.g., jumping from a height) and could simply mean deciding to act. No preparations are described, such as acquiring means or writing a note. The absence of explicit details means this leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' (per rules: if unsure, choose 'Ideation').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current decision and future intention (""finally decided,"" ""goodbye"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. The reference to staying ""here about a month longer"" implies past distress or ideation but not a concrete attempt (e.g., no description of an action like taking pills). Thus, there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself,"" ""I don't want to live""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire). However, the lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (e.g., no mention of how, where, or when beyond general intent). Since no past or recent action is described, 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation'.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""finally ending,"" which are euphemisms for suicide. It expresses a desire to die, with emotional indicators like relief (""feel so relaxed"") and hopelessness (""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" implying the last year was unbearable). There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or substances mentioned for suicide. Preparations are implied by ""playing my favourite video game one last time,"" but this is a general last activity, not a direct suicide preparation like writing a note or acquiring means. No past suicidal actions are described; the focus is on future intent. The writer's desire to die appears genuine and welcomed, not unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" to convey a personal desire to die. The emotional tone (e.g., feeling relaxed about ending) confirms this is not distress about unwanted thoughts but a current wish to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools are mentioned. ""Playing my favourite video game one last time"" indicates a farewell activity but does not constitute an explicit plan, method, or suicide-specific preparation (like obtaining means). Since the method is vague and no clear preparations are stated, this does not meet the threshold for Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""before i end it all"") with no reference to any past or recent initiated suicidal actions. It is anticipatory, not descriptive of a concrete attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""end it all,"" ""call it quits""), placing it beyond Indicator (which lacks such intent). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or explicit preparations means it does not qualify as Behavior. With no past actions described, Attempt is not applicable. Therefore, the post fits Ideation best, as it centers on explicit suicidal thoughts without actionable details.

She hasn't posted anything in 2 days and isn't answering my messages. I'm scared pls tell me how do I know if she is ok ?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post is written by the author expressing concern for a friend who mentioned a past suicide attempt. Key elements include:
     - The friend ""tried to kill herself"" three days ago and is now on restrictions.
     - The friend has not posted or responded in two days, causing the author fear and distress.
     - The author explicitly states ""I need help"" and ""I'm scared,"" seeking advice on how to check on the friend's well-being.
     - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or related concepts apply to the author personally.
     - Emotional indicators (e.g., fear, helplessness) are present but are directed at the friend's situation, not the author's own state.
     - There are no references to the author having suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. All suicidal content is attributed to the friend.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No, the post does not explicitly mention suicide, death, or a desire to die in relation to the author. Phrases like ""I need help"" and ""I'm scared"" reflect concern for another person, not personal suicidal intent. The only explicit suicide reference is about the friend (""she had tried to kill herself""), not the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No, there is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide by the author. The post focuses solely on the friend's past actions and the author's emotional response.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event (the friend's suicide attempt three days ago) but no actions initiated by the author. The author's only ""action"" is seeking help for the friend, which is not a self-harm behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses general distress and fear about a friend's suicide attempt, but there is no personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or behaviors from the author. According to the rules, risk classification must be based solely on the author, not others mentioned.
   - This fits the 'Indicator' category: The post shows distress (e.g., ""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") and discusses suicide abstractly (via the friend's experience), but lacks any clear, current, personal suicidal intent or desire from the author. The distress stems from concern for another, not internal suicidal ideation.
   - It does not meet criteria for 'Ideation' (no personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan or method), or 'Attempt' (no self-initiated lethal action by the author).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide: ""I will hang myself now."" This is a direct reference to death and a specific method (hanging).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to be alone anymore""), despair (""nobody has ever liked me""), and isolation (""I've been alone since I was 5""). Past self-harm is mentioned, but it's noted as no longer helping, and there is no description of a past suicide attempt.
   - Specific plan/method is clear: ""hang myself"" and ""looking for something that I can tie"" indicate active preparation for the method. The writer also considers the method's lethality (""I don't think the thing will break off as I am only 44kg"").
   - Imminence is high with ""now"" indicating immediate intent.
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""hang myself,"" a direct suicidal phrase.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear, current desire to die (e.g., ""I will hang myself now"").
   - No, there is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted upon; instead, the writer is actively preparing.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (hanging) is mentioned.
   - Yes, there is active preparation: ""looking for something that I can tie"" to carry out the method.
   - This indicates planning and preparation, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""I will hang myself now"") with ongoing preparation (""now looking for something"").
   - Past self-harm is referenced but is not described as a suicidal action (e.g., no mention of a past suicide attempt). The self-harm is presented as a separate issue that no longer helps.
   - No initiated, potentially lethal action is described; the writer is in the planning/preparation phase.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - The presence of a specific method (hanging) and active preparation (seeking means) moves it from 'Ideation' (desire without plan) to 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., no description of an attempt) is present, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The self-harm mention is not equivalent to a suicide attempt.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal intent with a plan and preparation.

   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of being shattered, miserable, and dysfunctional (e.g., ""I feel so shattered,"" ""I just feel shitty,"" ""I can barely function""). 
   - It explicitly negates a desire to die: ""It's not even that I just want to die."" 
   - No mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't even know how to just live anymore"") and despair, but no suicidal intent. 
   - The focus is on current suffering and inability to cope, not on ending life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die; instead, the writer states they do not want to die (""It's not even that I just want to die""). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not present; the content reflects distress about their emotional state, not unwanted suicidal ideation. 
   - Leaning towards 'Indicator' due to the absence of personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of any plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. 
   - Without these elements, the post does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings only; no references to past or recent suicidal actions. 
   - No indication of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and misery without any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past action. 
   - The explicit negation of wanting to die (""It's not even that I just want to die"") reinforces that this is about distress, not suicidal ideation. 
   - There is no ambiguity requiring a higher category; all elements align with 'Indicator'.

120,"Hate this rat race. I got a job and I thought it was fun but they overwork me. They don't train me because they are busy. I just want to kill myself. People could say stuff like: well, start your own company. you don't get it. I want out now. In the beginning I thought: well, I should just work harder and I kept up with my work through self research because they don't have time. Well, how did they thank me? By giving me more. I can't handle it and when I say something about it, they respond with: well, the works keep coming. yeah, it is not my fault they organized themselves like trash. I am a hard worker but now I just don't see the need. Tf is this life? I want out.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses extreme distress and hopelessness about work overload and lack of support.  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I just want to kill myself,"" ""I want out now,"" ""Tf is this life? I want out.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""I can't handle it""), hopelessness (""I don't see the need""), and urgency (""want out now"").  
   - **No mention** of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past/future actions.  
   - Focus is on a *desire to escape* via suicide, not planning or acting.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself"" and reinforces desire (""I want out"").  
   - **No indication** these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**: No references to methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *current* emotional state and desire.  
   - **No mention** of past/ongoing actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm).

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny. Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also. Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post begins with ""AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""DIE""), expressing a direct personal desire. It discusses depression, worthlessness, suicidal thoughts as a ""cope,"" and self-loathing. Crucially, it escalates to specific methods: ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" for mayhem, instructions to ""make nitroglycerin at home,"" and targeting ""power plants."" These are explicit, lethal methods with implied preparation (""research where to find parts""). The tone shifts from self-reflection to advocating violent action, though framed as hypothetical (""if you change your mind""). No past actions by the author are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. ""I WANT TO DOIE [DIE]"" is a clear personal expression of a desire to die. The later violent methods are presented as alternatives to suicide, maintaining the theme of self-destruction.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. Specific methods (wire cutters for infrastructure sabotage, homemade explosives) and preparations (researching parts, targeting power plants) are detailed. This goes beyond general ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The methods are described as potential future actions (""if you want to do it""). No past or recent initiated lethal actions by the author are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""I WANT TO DIE"") satisfies **Ideation** threshold.
   - Detailed methods (explosives, sabotage tools) and preparations (research, sourcing parts) meet **Behavior** criteria.
   - No concrete past actions rule out **Attempt**.
   - The specificity of methods/preparations distinguishes this from **Ideation** or **Indicator**.

122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe bullying directed at the author's best friend, including the bully telling the friend to ""go kill yourself"" and making violent threats.  
   - The friend is described as mentally disturbed, constantly tired, not eating, withdrawing socially, feeling overwhelmed, and unable to stand up for herself.  
   - **Crucially, there is no mention of the friend expressing personal suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, or past actions related to suicide/self-harm.** The only reference to suicide is the bully's statement (""go kill yourself""), which is an external command, not the friend's own expression.  
   - The friend's distress manifests as exhaustion, social withdrawal, and emotional overwhelm—signs of psychological strain but **not explicit personal suicidal intent**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent from the friend** (the subject at risk). The friend is described as distressed but does not voice any suicidal ideation. The phrase ""go kill yourself"" is attributed to the bully, not the friend.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention of the friend having a suicide plan, method, or engaging in preparations.** The focus is on the bullying’s impact (e.g., fatigue, withdrawal), not actionable suicidal behavior by the friend.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No description of past or recent suicidal actions by the friend.** The post discusses ongoing harassment and its psychological effects but no concrete self-harm events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The friend exhibits distress (withdrawal, fatigue, overwhelm) likely due to bullying, but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire, plan, or action**. The bully’s statement does not equate to the friend endorsing suicidal intent.  
   - This aligns with **'Indicator'**: General distress without explicit personal suicidal desire or behavior from the at-risk individual.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself so bad.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Describes hopelessness (""I have nothing to look forward to""), isolation, self-loathing (""loser, ugly""), and mental illness.  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself"" is a clear method.  
   - No past actions described (e.g., no reference to prior attempts).  
   - Imminence: ""I don't know how much longer I could last"" suggests urgency but no specific timeline.  
   - Stated desire: Expresses a strong wish to die (""I want to hang myself""), countered only by a ""small piece of hope"" (ambivalence, not rejection of suicidal thoughts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide is on my mind everyday.""  
   - Yes: Clear desire to die (""I want to hang myself so bad"").  
   - No negation: The ""small piece of hope"" implies conflict but does not explicitly reject the desire to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself"" directly names a lethal means.  
   - No preparations mentioned (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **current** thoughts/desires (""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself"").  
   - **No description of past/initiated actions** (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself"" would indicate an attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die and specific method rule this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: While suicidal desire is present, the mention of a method (""hang myself"") moves it beyond ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific method (hanging), but no evidence of preparation or initiated action.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/recent concrete action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""attempted once again"" and ""my 15th time,"" indicating past suicidal actions.  
   - It expresses current desire to die (""still want to attempt again"") but also notes a mitigating factor (""found one thing to live for"").  
   - No specific future plan/method is described (e.g., tools, locations).  
   - Temporal context: ""last night"" refers to a very recent, concrete action.  
   - Healthcare barriers (insurance, COVID) are mentioned but don’t alter suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Attempted,"" ""still want to attempt again"" confirms personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No future plan/method/preparation is described. Past attempts are referenced, but no details imply imminent future behavior beyond desire.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key factor**: The post describes a *concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action* (""attempted once again"") that occurred very recently (""last night""). The phrase ""15th time"" reinforces a history of actual attempts.  
   - Current ideation (""still want to attempt"") exists but is secondary to the described recent action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past/recent suicidal actions take precedence over current ideation/plans per the rules.  
   - ""Attempted"" confirms an initiated, potentially lethal act (even if unsuccessful). This fits the **Attempt** definition.  
   - ""Still want to attempt again"" suggests ongoing ideation but lacks a specific future plan/method, so it doesn’t elevate to 'Behavior'.  
   - Mitigating factors (e.g., ""found one thing to live for"") don’t change the classification of the described past action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling,"" ""sad,"" ""scared.""  
   - Explicitly states a desire to not wake up: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""  
   - References past similar experiences (""as I've done this before"") but no description of a specific lethal action.  
   - No mention of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., note), or imminent timing.  
   - Expresses internal conflict: ""too scared to go all the way through,"" fear of burdening friends, and unwanted isolation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I hope I don't wake up"" directly expresses a desire to die (passively, via non-awakening).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die""). The core sentiment is a genuine wish not to survive.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific method or plan**: References ""falling asleep"" contextually, but no tools/substances/locations tied to suicide (e.g., no pills, ropes, or intent to overdose).  
   - **No preparations**: Describes hiding feelings from friends but no suicide-specific actions (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes recurring distress and passive hope of death during sleep, but **no concrete past or current suicidal action**. Phrases like ""I’ll wake up later"" and ""I’m still too scared to go all the way through"" imply no initiated lethal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""I hope I don’t wake up"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/current initiated lethal action** (only passive hope and fear of acting) → Rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am going to shoot myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have ran out of chances""), despair (""Too late to turn back""), farewell/goodbye messages.  
   - Specific method/preparation: ""loaded gun"" (method), room emptied/savings gone (preparations).  
   - Imminence: ""I'm writing this... not sure what will happen once I post this"" (action likely immediate).  
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""I am going to shoot myself"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""shoot myself"" confirm a clear, current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method (""shoot myself"") and tool (""loaded gun"") are stated. Preparations include emptying the room, depleting savings, and farewells.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intent (""I am going to shoot myself"") with imminent execution (after posting). No past or current *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I tried but failed""). Past ideation (since June) is noted but not acted upon.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - No concrete *initiated* action (e.g., pulling the trigger) → rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Plan/method is explicit → rules out 'Ideation'.  
   - Personal suicidal intent is unambiguous → rules out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a suicide attempt from a week ago, including specific actions like writing a suicide note, swallowing bleach, and vomiting. Emotional indicators include depression, stress, feeling unappreciated, and suicidal episodes. The method (bleach) and preparation (note) are clearly stated. The event is described as past (""a week ago""), with the user indicating they are ""a little okay now"" and ""doing better,"" but referencing the lingering impact (""but its still in there""). There is no mention of current suicidal desire, plans, or imminent intentions; instead, the focus is on sharing a past experience and recovery.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide episode"" and describes a clear desire to die at the time of the event (e.g., ""i thought that was the last breath i have""). However, this intent is contextual to the past episode, not expressed as a current desire. The user now states they are ""doing better"" and hopes ""no one does the same,"" suggesting the suicidal thoughts were not wanted long-term, but the explicit intent was present during the attempt.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparations (writing a suicide note) are mentioned. However, these are part of the past suicide attempt, not current or future behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event (""a week ago"") where the author initiated a specific, potentially lethal action (swallowing bleach) that was interrupted (vomiting) and failed. This constitutes a concrete suicidal act that was self-initiated and life-threatening, fitting the 'Attempt' definition. There is no description of current ideation, plans, or preparations; the user emphasizes recovery.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post is a detailed description of a past suicide attempt, including initiated action (swallowing bleach) that was potentially lethal but failed. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category, which prioritizes past or recent concrete actions over current states. While the user mentions ongoing distress (""its still in there""), the absence of current suicidal desire, plans, or imminent behavior rules out 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. The focus on a historical attempt, even with current improvement, necessitates 'Attempt' per the rules (e.g., ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described"").

The only thing stopping me is the thought of my parents going through the loss of another child :/ please help",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions losing a sibling, worsened anxiety and depression, loss of will to live, and a current desire to die (""I still want to die""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""lost all will to live""), despair, and concern about being a burden to parents (indirectly, by fearing their suffering).
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past actions involve coping efforts (""tried to pull through"" and finding distractions), but no description of any initiated suicidal actions or attempts.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the desire to die is expressed as a persistent feeling when alone.
   - The writer explicitly states a desire to die (""I still want to die""), but this is tempered by a barrier (fear of hurting parents), not an explicit rejection of the thoughts as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I still want to die"").
   - The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; instead, the thoughts are presented as genuine, with an external factor (parents) preventing action. Thus, this is not a case of distress about unwanted thoughts alone.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, gathering means) is mentioned or implied. The barrier (parents) is a deterrent, but it does not constitute planning or preparation for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past emotional struggles and coping efforts after the sibling's death, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of self-harm, attempts, or interrupted actions). The phrase ""tried to pull through"" refers to coping, not a suicidal act.
   - Current feelings of wanting to die are expressed, but without any indication of imminent action or initiation of a plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I still want to die""), which aligns with 'Ideation' as it includes explicit suicidal thoughts without any plan, method, or preparation.
   - It does not fit 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not abstract or accompanied by a clear statement of the thoughts being unwanted (e.g., the barrier is external, not an internal rejection).
   - It does not fit 'Behavior' because no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.
   - It does not fit 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated suicidal actions are described.

   - References a future contingency: taking LSD as a potential remedy, with acceptance of death if it fails (""my end will only get nearer,"" ""I'm fine with either outcome"").  
   - **No specific suicide method, plan, tools, or preparations** described. The LSD is framed as an intervention, not a means of self-harm.  
   - **No description of past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""thinking of suicide for months"" and implies desire for death if LSD fails (""my end will only get nearer"").  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/plan**: References taking LSD as a *precursor to potential suicide* but does **not** specify how suicide would be carried out (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions stealing and consuming dog's prescription hydrocodone (an opioid) combined with alcohol to ""feel ok."" 
    - Expresses distress (""i hit a new low,"" ""haven’t felt ok in a while"") and helplessness (""not sure what to do"").
    - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods tied to suicide. 
    - The hydrocodone/alcohol use is framed as a coping mechanism (""to feel ok for one night""), not a suicide attempt. 
    - No stated desire to die, no plans/preparations for suicide, and no descriptions of past/current suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die. 
    - Distress is evident, but the focus is on seeking temporary relief, not ending life. 
    - **Answer: No**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - While substances (hydrocodone/alcohol) are mentioned, they are used for coping, not as part of a suicidal plan. 
    - No tools, locations, notes, or other preparations tied to suicide. 
    - **Answer: No plan/method/preparation for suicide identified**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes a recent action (taking hydrocodone/drinking) but frames it as self-medication, not self-harm. 
    - No indication this was an initiated suicidal act (e.g., no mention of intent to overdose lethally). 
    - **Answer: No concrete suicidal action**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post shows **distress** (hopelessness, substance misuse) but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal intent, plan, or attempt. 
    - Harmful behavior (substance misuse) is present but not linked to suicide. 
    - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without suicidal desire/ideation. 
    - *Not Ideation*: No expressed wish to die.  
    - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No suicide plan, method, or initiated lethal action.

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore"") and despair (""I don't have any friends,"" ""Nothing in my life is working out""), which are emotional indicators of distress.
   - There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or means.
   - No specific plans, preparations, or references to past actions are present.
   - The temporal context is general, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The phrase ""I see no point in living anymore"" suggests a passive wish to not be alive but lacks a clear, explicit desire for suicide or death. It reads as a statement of hopelessness rather than an active intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - The expression ""I see no point in living"" implies a desire to not be alive but is not explicit about wanting to die (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""I want to die""). Given the ambiguity, it leans toward distress about life circumstances rather than a clear suicidal desire (No for explicit desire).
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and the primary sentiment is distress without explicit suicidal intent, this aligns with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, or notes).
   - Without any planning elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current state of mind (hopelessness) with no references to past or recent actions, initiated attempts, or future intentions involving concrete steps. Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks an explicit personal expression of a desire to die or commit suicide. The phrase ""I see no point in living"" is ambiguous regarding genuine suicidal desire and is more indicative of emotional distress.
   - Following the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Indicator' as the post expresses distress without clear suicidal intent or action.

132,"Update I guess. So my friend now knows this account and I didn't delete all my history so she knows how fucked up I am. I didn't anyone to know, obviously. It's unfair on them, my problems are my own not theirs. They deserve so much more than me and know I feel so guilty. &amp;#x200B;. So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" which directly references a specific method (pills) for a potentially lethal self-harm action. 
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel so guilty""), feelings of being a burden (""It's unfair on them,"" ""They deserve so much more than me""), and despair about the situation.
   - Specific method (pills) and preparation are implied through the action described as already taken (""taken a fuck load of pills"").
   - The action is in the past tense (""taken""), indicating it has been initiated, with imminent consequences (""might not wake up tomorrow"").
   - The writer implies a desire to die through the context of taking pills to avoid waking up, without any indication that this is unwanted or just a thought.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not use explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies a desire to die through the action and consequence (""might not wake up tomorrow"").
   - The desire to die is personal and not negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (pills) is mentioned, and the action has been carried out (""taken""), indicating preparation and initiation.
   - This goes beyond mere ideation or planning, as the action is described as completed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") that is self-initiated and potentially lethal.
   - The outcome is pending (""might not wake up tomorrow""), but the action itself has been initiated, which fits the 'Attempt' category, even if the result is uncertain.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a desire to die (implied) and describes a specific, initiated action (taking pills) that is potentially lethal.
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal desire to die and action taken. It is not 'Ideation' because a method is mentioned and action has occurred. It is not 'Behavior' because 'Behavior' involves planning or preparation without initiated action; here, the action has been taken, making it 'Attempt'.
   - The past action (taking pills) takes precedence, aligning with the 'Attempt' definition, which includes initiated, potentially lethal actions, even if the outcome is unknown.

I am and will not be one of those people.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning out my suicide"" and expresses a strong desire to die without intervention (""no intention of anyone stopping me"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""can't find a reason to continue living""), fear of past failure (""fear of failing an attempt once again""), and a sense of being a burden.  
   - A specific timeline is stated (""beginning of the new year, come January 1st"").  
   - Preparations include secrecy (""not make those around me suffer"") and determination (""I will go through with this"").  
   - A past attempt is referenced (""fear of failing an attempt once again""), but the focus is on future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the author directly states ""planning out my suicide"" and ""I will go through with this,"" expressing a clear desire to die. There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, a plan is explicitly mentioned with a timeline (""January 1st""). While no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is detailed, the author discusses active preparations (secrecy, avoiding past mistakes) and determination to succeed.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""I intend to do it right this time"") and references a past attempt. However, no *recent or ongoing* lethal action is described (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday""). The focus is on planning for a future act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: The author expresses a desire to die (Ideation) **and** specifies a plan (timeline: January 1st) and preparations (ensuring secrecy, learning from past failures). The mention of a past attempt does not override the current focus on future planning. Since no recent/ongoing lethal action is described, it is not an Attempt.

I actually hate being alive but i dont want to weigh down my family and friends. sometimes i wonder if i should just do it now because if i wait for later it will just hurt them more. For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of not wanting to live (""100% do not want to live anymore""), hating being alive, and explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""wonder if i should just do it now""). Emotional indicators are strong, including hopelessness (""hate being alive""), feeling like a burden (""don't want to weigh down my family and friends""), and despair (""wish i was never born""). However, there is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) described. The author expresses fear of acting on these thoughts (""too scared to kill myself"") and focuses on internal conflict rather than immediate action. The temporal context is present/future-oriented (""do it now,"" ""wait for later""), with no reference to past suicidal actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive""). While the author states they are ""too scared to kill myself,"" this indicates reluctance to act due to fear, not an explicit rejection of the desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or distressing in a way that negates the underlying wish to not be alive; instead, the desire is present but inhibited by external concerns (e.g., burdening family). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied. The phrase ""do it now"" is vague and speculative, lacking details about how suicide would be carried out. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The absence of a concrete plan or method rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and hypothetical future intentions (e.g., ""wonder if i should just do it now""), but there is no description of any past or recent suicidal actions that were initiated (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). All content is contemplative, focusing on feelings and thoughts rather than behaviors. This confirms the absence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a strong personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. The lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation distinguishes this from 'Behavior'. The fear of acting and concern for others do not diminish the expressed desire to die, so it does not fit 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). With no past actions described, 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""attempt suicide"" directly and describes a specific method: hanging.  
   - Details preparations: using a chair/elevated object to stand on after a minute to avoid death.  
   - Describes *repeated past actions* (""frequently,"" ""i hang myself but always leave..."").  
   - Explicitly states the action is initiated but interrupted by the author (""stand onto after a minute... so I don't die"").  
   - No explicit negation of desire to die; focuses on the mechanics of interrupted actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""attempt suicide"" and describes self-hanging.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (hanging) and preparation (chair/object) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past/repeated actions** that were initiated and potentially lethal (hanging), though interrupted by the author.  
   - The phrase ""half heartedly attempt suicide"" confirms concrete actions were taken, even if not fatal.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is the description of **initiated, potentially lethal actions** (hanging) that the author interrupted. This fits 'Attempt' (past/recent actions with lethal potential, even if stopped).  
   - Despite the self-interruption and lack of fatal outcome, the concrete initiation of hanging (a lethal method) qualifies as an attempt.  
   - Rules emphasize: 'Attempt' includes interrupted/failed actions initiated by the author.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left.

I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal history: ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" ""had an attempt when I was 14,"" and ""a few close calls.""  
   - Expresses current hopelessness: ""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" and ""this world's just not meant for me.""  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation for imminent suicide is described in the present context.  
   - Focuses on distress from life circumstances (family conflict, relationship struggles) and emotional pain.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I've been suicidal"") and a past attempt.  
   - Current desire to die is expressed (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore""), but the phrasing leans toward resignation rather than imminent intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan or method** described for acting on suicidal thoughts. References to past attempts (""had an attempt,"" ""close calls"") are historical and lack specifics about means/preparations in the present.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Clearly describes a **past suicide attempt** (""had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out"") and other ""close calls.""  
   - The post does not describe a recent or ongoing suicidal action. Current expressions are limited to ideation and distress.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author’s description of a **concrete past suicide attempt** (""barely made it out"") meets the criteria for 'Attempt' (a potentially lethal self-initiated action).  
   - Current statements express hopelessness and passive suicidal ideation but lack plans/preparations, which would otherwise suggest 'Behavior' or active 'Ideation.'

I'll break killing myself regardless.I just wish I could die in my sleep instead. Maybe I'll get lucky and increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and ""die in my sleep."" It also references self-harm (""start cutting again"") as a means to increase COVID risk, which could indirectly contribute to death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I just wish I could die in my sleep"") and a sense of inevitability (""One of these days I'll finally do it"").
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""hang myself,"" with details on preparation (""I've done it many times and I figured out how to properly hang myself""). The phrase ""figured out how"" implies planning and knowledge acquisition.
   - There are references to past actions: ""I've done it many times"" likely refers to past suicide attempts or behaviors, and ""start cutting again"" indicates a history of self-harm. However, these are not described as specific, initiated lethal actions (e.g., no details on when, how, or outcomes).
   - Imminence is indicated with ""One of these days"" and ""at the moment there is too much potential interference,"" suggesting a future plan rather than immediate action.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I'll finally do it,"" ""I'm not afraid of killing myself anymore,"" ""I just wish I could die""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and similar phrases. It expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any negation (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method (""hang myself"") is mentioned, and there is evidence of preparation (""figured out how to properly hang myself""). The reference to ""potential interference"" implies situational planning. The self-harm mention (""start cutting again"") is secondary and tied to increasing COVID risk, but the primary focus is on hanging as a suicide method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes future intentions (""One of these days I'll finally do it"") and past events (""I've done it many times""). However, the past actions (""done it many times"") are vague and lack specific details about initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no description of what occurred during these events). Thus, this does not clearly meet the threshold for 'Attempt', which requires concrete descriptions of past actions. The current focus is on future behavior with a plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan/method (hanging), which aligns with 'Behavior'. The mention of past events is insufficient to override to 'Attempt' due to vagueness. There is no ambiguity about suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'. 'Ideation' is ruled out because a plan and preparation are present.

   - The post mentions persistent thoughts over a year (""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all"") and feelings of doom (""feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing""). 
   - Key emotional indicators: hopelessness, dread, and intrusive suicidal ideation. 
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. 
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or imminent timelines. 
   - The phrasing (""thoughts telling me to end it all"") frames the suicidal thoughts as intrusive/distressing rather than an explicit personal desire to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - ""End it all"" is an explicit suicide reference. 
   - However, the writer does not state a *personal desire* to die (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Instead, suicidal thoughts are described passively (""thoughts telling me""), suggesting distress about the thoughts themselves. No explicit negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present, but the framing leans toward unwanted intrusive thoughts.

I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature.

My miserable ass is is as useless as the shit that comes out of it.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness, self-loathing (""useless, shameless, pathetic loser""), worthlessness (""waste resources""), and isolation.  
   - **Explicit past suicidal actions**: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor.""  
   - **Methods are specified** (drowning, hanging, jumping from height), and **actions were initiated** but stopped (""chickened out"").  
   - **No current plan or preparation** is mentioned; the focus is on past failed attempts and ongoing despair.  
   - Desire to die is implied through self-deprecation but not explicitly stated for the present (e.g., ""Why should I still live?"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Past suicidal actions are explicitly described (drowning, hanging, jumping), confirming a historical desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present for those past events.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Past methods** (drowning, hanging, jumping) are specific, but these are tied to **completed past actions** (attempts), not current plans. No imminent threat or future preparation is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions dominate**: The author describes **concrete, initiated, potentially lethal acts** (trying to drown/hang/jump) that were stopped by self-interruption (""chickened out""). This meets the 'Attempt' threshold (initiated acts, even if aborted).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past potentially lethal actions (drowning, hanging, jumping) are explicitly stated and initiated, fitting **'Attempt'** per the definition (""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... even if interrupted"").  
   - Current expressions align with 'Ideation' (desire to die implied) and 'Behavior' (methods referenced historically), but **'Attempt' takes precedence** because concrete past actions are the clearest and most severe element.

Living is just so frustrating for someone like me, it doesn't help that i'm sensitive af and that my relationship with my mom sucks. To top it all off I have been doing nothing for the past year dropped out of college because I was burned out and quite my parttime job. If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15 years old. I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself which is the only positive thing. I might actually get the courage to do it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15,"" ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Living is not for me,"" ""Living is so frustrating""), despair (""crippling anxiety,"" ""relationship with my mom sucks""), anhedonia (""I have been doing nothing for the past year"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, location) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. The references to suicide are general.
   - References to past actions: ""I would have been gone when I was 15"" implies past suicidal desire but no concrete action—it's hypothetical (""if suicide wasn't hard"") and not described as an initiated attempt.
   - Imminence: ""I might actually get the courage to do it"" suggests future possibility but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Stated desire: Expresses a genuine wish to die (e.g., ""I would have been gone,"" ""kill myself"") and frames increasing confidence as ""the only positive thing."" Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself.""
   - Yes, expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I would have been gone,"" ""get the courage to do it"").
   - No, suicidal thoughts are not negated or described as unwanted; instead, confidence in acting on them is growing. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means).
   - Without any plan/method/preparation, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes past suicidal desire at age 15 but no concrete action initiated—it's conditional and hypothetical.
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""becoming more confident,"" ""might get the courage""), but no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action. Thus, not an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts are present, so not 'Indicator'.
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation, so not 'Behavior'.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action, so not 'Attempt'.
   - Best fit is 'Ideation' due to personal expressions of suicidal desire without concrete plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""the pain is too much,"" despair, and a desire to die (""be dead"").  
   - Explicitly states a method (Trazodone + alcohol) and preparation (""I have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today"").  
   - Specifies imminence (""dead in less than 24 hours"").  
   - No reference to past actions; focuses on future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""be dead"" in a self-referential context of ending life.  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""the pain is too much"" + ""be dead"").  
   - No indication of unwanted thoughts; desire is actively stated.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (Trazodone + alcohol) and preparations (acquiring means: ""have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **future intention** (""will get alcohol,"" ""be dead in less than 24 hours"").  
   - **No past/recent initiated action** (e.g., no mention of taking pills yet).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Specific method/preparations mentioned** → Rules out *Ideation*.  
   - **No initiated lethal action** (only planning/preparation) → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Behavior**: Explicit desire + plan/method/preparation (Trazodone/alcohol + acquiring means).

Absolutely nothing. My life has no worth. No meaning.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep despair, hopelessness (""Every year I think things are going to get better, and they don't""), anhedonia (""I should be happy, but I'm not""), worthlessness (""I bring nothing to the table... no worth""), and guilt.  
   - Mentions a desire to ""give up"" and existential questioning (""Why the fuck am I alive?"").  
   - **No explicit references to suicide, death, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**  
   - Focuses on emotional pain, past trauma, and feeling trapped by negative thoughts—**not on active suicidal desire or intent**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - ""I want to give up"" is vague; it **lacks explicit desire to die** (could mean giving up on efforts to improve).  
   - Existential questioning (""Why am I alive?"") reflects distress but **not a stated wish to end life**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or actions toward suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **chronic emotional struggles**, not past/current suicidal actions.  
   - **No reference to initiated self-harm** (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Dominant themes are **hopelessness and worthlessness without suicidal intent**.  
   - ""I want to give up"" is ambiguous but **insufficient for 'Ideation'** (no explicit wish to die).  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress about life/unwanted thoughts, **no personal desire for death or suicide**.

(Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I'm going to die,"" indicating a desire for death.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""cushion the pain"") and acceptance of death.  
   - A specific method is described: using anorexia to starve to death by lowering weight to 78 pounds or less.  
   - Preparations are implied (setting a ""goal weight"" and strategizing to make death gradual).  
   - The context is future-oriented (""going to,"" ""new goal weight""), with no mention of past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""I'm going to die"" show a clear, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and detailed method/preparation align with **Behavior** (suicidal thoughts + plan/preparation).  
   - No past/ongoing lethal action occurred, ruling out **Attempt**.

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" directly and specifies a method: ""charcoal bbq in a tent,"" which refers to carbon monoxide poisoning from burning charcoal in an enclosed space. However, it is framed as a question about feasibility (""Is it possible...?""), not as a personal expression of intent or desire.
   - There are no emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, or burden. No references to past actions, preparations, or imminence (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The phrasing is impersonal and inquisitive; it does not state a genuine wish to die from the author's perspective but rather seeks information.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide,"" but it is in the context of a general question, not a personal declaration (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). The author does not express a personal desire to die or any suicidal thoughts for themselves. Instead, it is an abstract discussion of a method. Therefore, explicit personal intent is absent, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent) is mentioned, but it is part of a hypothetical question, not an indication that the author has a plan or is preparing to act. There is no evidence of personal preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note). Since no personal suicidal desire is expressed, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes no past or recent actions initiated by the author (e.g., no references to trying the method). It is entirely future-oriented and speculative, with no indication of concrete steps taken. Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly by inquiring about a method, but it lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or intent from the author. It falls under 'Indicator' because it involves a general discussion of suicide without clear current, personal suicidal desire. The mention of a method does not elevate it to 'Behavior' or 'Ideation' since there is no accompanying personal ideation. Ambiguity about genuine desire also defaults to 'Indicator' per the rules.

146,"Life so full of contradictions that it's not worth it. I feel like everything about me is wrong and that it's only going to leave me alone for the rest of my life, and the part I feel worst about is that I shouldn't feel this way. Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""want to die"" but immediately negates intent: ""I don't feel like actually committing die.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""it's only going to leave me alone""), self-loathing (""embarrassment,"" ""don't deserve anything""), and feeling like a burden (""everyone would be better off without dealing with me"").  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions related to suicide.  
   - Primary themes are distress about identity (trans, body dysphoria), isolation, and guilt over perceived burdensomeness.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly states ""want to die"" but clarifies suicidal thoughts are not actionable: ""**I don't feel like actually committing die**."" The phrase ""want to die"" is framed as a passive consequence of self-blame, not an active desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past or imminent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts (""want to die"") are explicitly rejected as unwanted/inactionable, aligning with **Indicator**.  
   - Overwhelming distress, burdensomeness, and hopelessness are present but lack current personal suicidal intent, plan, or behavior.  
   - Falls under Indicator due to negation of genuine desire to act (""I don't feel like actually committing die"") and absence of plan/method.

I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""My heart hurts,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" ""it hurts so much and I just feel like dying.""  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is stated: ""I want to die"" and ""I feel like I don't want to live"" (repeated twice).  
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions are mentioned.  
   - The context is relational despair after a fight, with passive resignation (""passively letting whatever happen happen"").  
   - No indication of unwanted suicidal thoughts; the desire to die is presented as a direct emotional response.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I feel like I don't want to live"" are clear personal expressions of a desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are referenced.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No past/recent actions**: The post describes feelings and thoughts (""feel like dying""), not concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and lack of negation (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"") place this beyond **Indicator**.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of initiated self-harm actions (past or recent) rules out **Attempt**.  
   - **Ideation** fits: The author personally expresses suicidal desire without plans or actions.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me anymore""), feelings of worthlessness (""I'm an abomination""), and intrusive violent thoughts (e.g., thoughts of hurting others, wanting to be assaulted).  
   - The metaphor of a ""sick dog"" waiting to be ""put down"" indirectly references death/dying but frames it passively (""Eventually it'll get sick enough..."") rather than as a direct personal intention.  
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, death, or specific methods (e.g., pills, cutting). The closest reference is the dog metaphor, which is abstract and not tied to the author’s direct actions.  
   - The author questions their own desires (e.g., ""Why do I want horrible things to happen to me?"") but does not state a current, personal wish to die.  
   - No indications of plans, preparations, methods, timelines, or past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a desire to die. The dog metaphor implies a resigned acceptance of potential death but lacks personal agency or intent (e.g., ""the dog put itself down"" is hypothetical and detached).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned**; the focus is on distress, confusion, and unwanted violent/self-punishing ideation (e.g., wanting trauma/illness to ""feel valid"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** references to plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide or self-harm. The ""3 weeks"" deadline suggests a desire for change, not a suicide timeline.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No** description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, aborted efforts, or self-injury). The dog metaphor is figurative and not a report of concrete behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The primary themes are **distress, hopelessness, and intrusive thoughts** (about violence, trauma, and illness) without explicit suicidal desire, plan, or action.  
   - The dog metaphor conveys despair but is too abstract and impersonal to qualify as suicidal ideation. It lacks a clear statement of the author’s *own* wish to die.  
   - Meets **Indicator** criteria: Expressions of severe distress, unwanted thoughts, and vague references to death/dying without personal suicidal intent, plan, or behavior.  
   - Does **not** meet thresholds for Ideation (no explicit desire to die), Behavior (no plan/method), or Attempt (no initiated actions).  
   - *Per rules*: When ambiguous about genuine suicidal desire, default to ""Indicator.""

Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months,"" indicating persistent suicidal ideation.
   - References concrete preparation: ""drafted my will.""
   - Expresses emotional conflict (shame/guilt about not ""following through,"" feeling ""obligated"" to suicide) but explicitly states, ""I don't think I would do 'it',"" and emphasizes relief when out of slumps.
   - Discusses methods hypothetically (avoiding weapons/household items, not involving family) but no active/imminent plan stated.
   - No description of past/current initiated lethal actions; focuses on thoughts and preparation (will).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: Directly uses ""suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide,"" and ""suicide pact."" Desire is implied but conflicted and explicitly negated later (""I don't think I would do 'it'"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes: ""Drafted my will"" is a specific preparation tied to suicidal intent. Mentions avoiding certain methods but no active plan/method disclosed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes ongoing ideation (""months"") and recent preparation (will drafted ""yesterday""). No past/current initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die is present (""plotting suicide""), despite conflicted feelings.
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of initiated lethal actions.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: ""Drafted my will"" is a clear suicidal preparation (aligning with ""Behavior""). The specificity of this act outweighs the lack of a concrete future plan/method. While the author expresses doubt about acting, the preparation itself meets the threshold for ""Behavior.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses significant emotional distress, feelings of being misunderstood and abused (""i get abused enough at home""), hopelessness (""i have no one""), and frustration with interpersonal relationships.  
   - Mentions feeling depressed and criticized for it (""mocked for feeling depressed"").  
   - The strongest emotional statement is: ""i want it to stop and if i leave them i have no one."" This conveys despair and isolation but **does not explicitly reference death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**.

   - Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i'm so tired,"" ""i have no more energy,"" ""the world is just fucked,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED"") and references to past trauma (""how can you do those sorts of things to a child,"" abandonment issues). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means related to the author. 
   - Phrases like ""it's finally over"" suggest relief from a stressful situation, not a suicidal act. The line ""you should've laid in bed for a couple more hours, give us all some peace finally"" expresses a wish for the other person's absence/death, not the author's own desire to die. 
   - No explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, preparations, or past actions by the author are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a personal desire to die or not be alive. The distress is focused on external circumstances and anger toward others, not inward suicidal intent.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, there is no indication of them being unwanted or resisted. The primary sentiment is distress without personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of any plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references past events (e.g., childhood trauma) but no description of any self-initiated, potentially lethal actions by the author (e.g., no attempts, interrupted actions, or failures).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows general distress, hopelessness, and anger, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions.
   - This fits the 'Indicator' category: expressions of distress or despair without explicit suicidal intent from the author. The vague references to peace or exhaustion do not translate to a personal wish to die.
   - Rules applied: If no desire to die is personally expressed, it is 'Indicator'. Ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator'.

152,"I don't want to kill myself, but. I have literally nothing going for me. I graduated college almost 2 years ago, and I still don't have a job. I pushed all my friends away. I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long. Everyone I know has a great job, a great relationship, their own apartment; they're all moving forward in life, meanwhile I'm still sitting in the same house that I grew up in. I'm so sick of this. I've always been a melancholic guy, but I really want to give life a chance. I want to have financial independence, a girlfriend, hobbies, and see where it takes me. But it seems like the world rejects me at every turn. I've always prided myself on being a pretty tough and resilient person, but I've reached a point where I really don't know what's next for me. I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and frustration about life circumstances (e.g., unemployment, isolation, stagnation, feeling rejected).  
   - Key phrases: ""I don't want to kill myself, but..."" explicitly negates suicidal intent; ""I’m sick of *this* life"" indicates dissatisfaction with current circumstances, not a desire to die.  
   - No mentions of death, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm/suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing is going to change""), despair (""walls are closing in""), but balanced by expressed desires for purpose, relationships, and improvement (""I want to give life a chance"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The author explicitly states, ""I don’t want to kill myself,"" framing their distress around life dissatisfaction, not a genuine desire to die. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and the tone emphasizes a wish for change rather than escape via death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None**. No references to methods, tools, locations, preparations, or timelines for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggles and past life events (e.g., unemployment, isolation) but **no mention of past/current suicidal actions**, attempts, or preparations.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post centers on **general distress and hopelessness** without explicit suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors. The clear negation of suicidal intent (""I don’t want to kill myself"") and focus on desiring life improvements align with **Indicator**. While despair is evident, the absence of suicidal ideation or planning rules out higher categories.

153,Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult. How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations. I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family but I know I shouldn't I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out . Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a personal desire to die.
   - Specific temporal context: ""tomorrow while my mom is out"" implies a planned timeframe for action.
   - Mentions preparatory behavior: ""hit up everyone I have in my contacts"" (suggesting potential farewells).
   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelm, hopelessness (""can't get myself to do anything""), self-loathing (""too weak and pathetic""), and isolation (""small support system"").
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, and no description of past/current lethal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die tomorrow"" express a clear personal desire to die. The qualifier ""I know I shouldn’t"" shows ambivalence but does not negate the active desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Plan**: The timeframe ""tomorrow while my mom is out"" specifies intent to act during an opportunity.
   - **Preparation**: ""Hit up everyone I have in my contacts"" suggests initiating farewells (a recognized preparatory step).
   - No explicit method (e.g., tools/locations), but the combination of timing and farewells constitutes planning/preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on future intent (""tomorrow""). No description of past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday"").
   - ""Too weak to do it"" implies no action has been taken yet.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out Indicator.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The specific plan (timing: ""tomorrow"") and preparation (contacting people) elevate this beyond mere desire (Ideation) to Behavior.
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No described initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I took pills""), so Attempt does not apply.
   - Ambivalence (""I know I shouldn’t"") does not override the presence of planning elements.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses suicidal desire, a timeframe for action, and preparatory behavior, fitting the **Behavior** category.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""beyond saving""), despair (""dead inside,"" ""still sad""), and anhedonia (""still anhedonic"").  
   - Explicit suicidal language: ""yeet myself"" is slang for self-harm/suicide, indicating a direct personal desire to act.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned).  
   - No description of past actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context: Current feelings (""I just want..."") with no imminent timeline.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""yeet myself"" explicitly denotes suicidal/self-harm intent. The writer does not state these thoughts are unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While ""yeet myself"" implies action, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current ideation (""I just want"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal action**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (""yeet myself""), ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a concrete past action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die/act, but no plan or method specified.

God im such a fucking loser. i could really use someone to talk too. All my friends are judgmental assholes who wont understand me at all. I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions past suicide attempt: ""I tried to end it once before.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""i’m such a fucking loser""), isolation (""All my friends are judgmental assholes""), and distress over life setbacks.  
   - References a *past action* (""tried to end it"") and regret it failed (""Sometimes i wish i succeeded"").  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, timeline, or active steps).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""end it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide.  
   - Explicit desire to die is tied to the *past attempt* (""wish i succeeded""), not a current declaration (e.g., no ""I will do it now"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current method, plan, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, notes, or imminent actions).  
   - Past attempt is referenced but lacks specifics about method/preparation at that time.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Key phrase: ""I tried to end it once before"" confirms a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**.  
   - ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" expresses regret about the attempt’s failure but does not indicate new behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicidal *action* (""tried to end it"") meets the 'Attempt' definition (concrete, initiated, potentially lethal).  
   - Current expressions (distress, hopelessness) lack a plan/method, so they don’t qualify as 'Behavior'.  
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence over 'Ideation'/'Indicator' per rules, as a past lethal action is described.  
   - Not 'Behavior' because no *current* plan/method exists; not 'Ideation' because the core issue is a *past action*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""I just wanna kill myself out of fear,"" explicitly stating suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: panic attack, fear.  
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes).  
   - No past actions or attempts described.  
   - Imminence: The phrase ""I just wanna"" expresses a current desire but lacks a timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent.  
   - The author does *not* negate this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **current** emotional state (panic attack) and desire to die.  
   - **No** reference to past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" or ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated action → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Personal expression of suicidal desire without a plan or preparatory steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""give up and just get it over with"" and ""why keep going?""—suggesting possible suicidal ideation, but framed as an internal struggle (""my brain is screaming at me"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle""), defeat, and despair.  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide/death terms (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""), specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focuses on intrusive thoughts (""brain is screaming"") and distress about recurring feelings, not a stated personal desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - The phrase ""get it over with"" is ambiguous but framed as an unwanted thought (""my brain is screaming""), not a personal desire. The writer expresses distress about being ""back here"" (in a dark place) but doesn’t state *they want to die*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses recurring feelings (""every time I am back here"") but **no description** of past or imminent actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress about intrusive thoughts** (""brain is screaming at me"") and hopelessness, but the author does not explicitly endorse a desire to die. The phrasing suggests these thoughts are *unwanted* (e.g., ""thought I was doing better,"" ""defeated"").  
   - Lacks explicit personal desire for suicide, plans, or actions. Meets 'Indicator' criteria: abstract distress, unwanted thoughts, no plan/method. Ambiguity about genuine desire leans toward 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: feeling annoyed, stupid, offended, crying.  
   - Explicitly states: ""This is one of the reasons why I **currently have suicidal thoughts**.""  
   - **No** mention of death/dying methods, plans, preparations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past actions.  
   - **No** expression of a *desire* to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), only acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts.  
   - Focus is on distress from bullying and self-criticism, with suicidal thoughts framed as a consequence.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (**Yes**).  
   - **No** expression of a *desire* to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - The phrasing (""reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts"") implies the thoughts are *unwanted* consequences of external events, not an active wish to die.

   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are present but lack desire, plan, or preparation → **Not Ideation** (which requires *desire* to die).

Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning to commit suicide.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'll never be happy""), despair (""I have to go""), anger (""I'm angry""), and feeling trapped (""no choice but to end it"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence is vague (""planning,"" but no timeframe like ""tonight"").  
   - The writer expresses a desire to die due to circumstances but also sadness about unmet dreams. There is **no statement negating the desire** (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""planning to commit suicide,"" ""have to go,"" and ""end it"" show explicit personal suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While ""planning"" is mentioned, **no specific method, tools, location, or preparations** are described. The term ""planning"" alone is vague and lacks concrete details.

   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""planning"").

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""attempting suicide"" twice explicitly.  
   - Emotional indicators: regret, embarrassment, hopelessness (""I want to rip my hair out,"" ""dreading this,"" ""cannot stand living"").  
   - Describes being ""so close to attempting suicide"" but **no specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned.  
   - Action taken: Reached out to mom via text instead of attempting. No lethal action initiated.  
   - Temporal context: Past crisis (""I was so close"") led to current outcome (moving home).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""attempting suicide"" and links it to a personal crisis (""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide"").  
   - Desire is framed as averted by reaching out, but the *genuine desire to die* is implied in the past context.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past crisis** (""I was so close to attempting suicide"") but **no initiated lethal action**. The action taken was texting mom, not self-harm.

   - Explicit desire to die (""attempting suicide"") places it beyond *Indicator*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned, so not *Behavior*.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" but immediately negates it with ""I wont kill myself of course."" This indicates a reference to suicide but not an endorsement or desire to act.
   - Emotional indicators include intense distress (""I cant take it,"" ""the pain makes me want to scream and break everything,"" ""Its excruciating""), showing despair and frustration, but not hopelessness tied to a wish to die.
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current emotional pain.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for suicide; instead, suicide is explicitly ruled out.
   - The writer states they do not want to act on suicidal thoughts (""I wont kill myself of course""), framing the mention of suicide as unwanted or hypothetical.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" but the desire to die is clearly negated. The phrase ""of course"" emphasizes that suicide is not a current intention. The primary expression is distress about pain, not a genuine wish to die. This aligns with 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts without personal desire).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The urge to ""scream and break everything"" relates to frustration, not suicidal behavior. Without any suicidal planning element, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional suffering, not past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and abstractly references suicide (""kill myself"") but explicitly states no current personal desire to die (""I wont... of course""). This fits 'Indicator', which includes unwanted suicidal thoughts without genuine intent. There is no evidence of active suicidal ideation (desire to die), behavior (plan/method), or attempt (past action). Ambiguity about desire is resolved in favor of 'Indicator' per the rules.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses distress related to appearance obsession, gender dysphoria intensified by societal pressures, hatred of feminine activities (makeup, girly clothing), and a desire to transition genders (""I want to be a male now"").
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators: Distress, discomfort, and dysphoria are present, but no explicit hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or feelings of being a burden in a suicidal context.
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide or self-harm.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for any harmful intentions.
   - The writer's stated desire is focused on gender identity change, not a wish to die or engage in suicidal behavior. There is no expression of unwanted suicidal thoughts or a struggle with such thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The statement ""I want to be a male now"" indicates a desire for life change, not death.
   - No discussion of suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted.
   - Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of any suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., writing a note) for suicide.
   - Content is solely about gender-related distress and identity, not actionable suicidal behavior.
   - No basis for 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current feelings and desires (e.g., wanting to stop obsessing, hating feminine activities, wanting to be male).
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, self-harm, or interrupted behaviors).
   - No basis for 'Attempt' category.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general psychological distress (gender dysphoria, appearance-related stress) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.
   - Falls under 'Indicator' because:
     - Distress is present, but there is no explicit or implicit suicidal ideation, intent, or action.
     - Vague or abstract references to death/suicide are absent; the focus is on identity and social pressures.
     - Without any suicidal content, it does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt'.
   - Rule application: Since there is ambiguity or doubt about suicidal desire, and no such desire is expressed, 'Indicator' is appropriate.

   - Focus on internal conflict: expresses desire to die (""wish I had the courage to end it all"") but counters with a wish to ""endure"" and urges others to ""stay around.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""wish I had the courage to end it all,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act""). The emphasis on lacking ""courage"" implies unresolved intent, not rejection of the thought.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, methods, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current feelings**, not past actions. No mention of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it all"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current concrete actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Though the post includes hopeful messaging, the personal expression of suicidal desire is unambiguous, distinguishing it from **Indicator** (which requires absence of explicit desire).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""almost committed suicide a few days ago"" due to lack of means but states they ""still consider"" it. Explicitly references suicide and ongoing consideration.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (isolation, family conflict, anxiety severity), but the core focus is on suicidal intent.
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation described (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned; only notes the absence of means). 
   - Temporal context: Refers to a past near-event (""a few days ago"") where suicide was considered but not acted upon due to lacking means. No indication of an initiated lethal action.
   - Desire to die is explicitly personal and current (""still consider"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: Phrases like ""almost committed suicide"" and ""still consider"" show a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of these thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No: While suicide is explicitly mentioned, there is no description of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note). The lack of means (""didn't have anything to do it with"") reinforces the absence of actionable planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Past consideration (""almost committed"") but no evidence of an initiated, potentially lethal action. The phrase ""almost committed"" implies intent but not execution (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm initiated). The lack of means further supports that no concrete action occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die and ongoing suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator' (which requires no genuine suicidal desire).
   - Absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to [action]"") rules out 'Attempt'. The near-event reflects ideation, not behavior or attempt.
   - Best fit: **Ideation** (explicit personal desire to die/suicidal thoughts, without plan/method).

165,suicide with me. can anyone suicide with me together. for those want to suicide too,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times, with phrases like ""suicide with me,"" ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" and ""for those want to suicide too."" This indicates a direct reference to suicide and a personal desire to engage in it.
   - There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair; the focus is on inviting others to join in suicide.
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The act of suicide is discussed generally.
   - No references to past actions, such as previous attempts or initiated behaviors.
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die by seeking partners for suicide, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicide"" in a personal context (e.g., ""suicide with me""), indicating a direct desire to die.
   - The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; instead, they actively seek collaboration.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied. The post refers to suicide in a general, non-specific way.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present. The invitation to others is not considered a preparation under the guidelines, as it lacks concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""suicide with me"") but no past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), aligning with 'Ideation' or higher. However, without any mention of a plan, method, or preparation, it cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.
   - The absence of unwanted suicidal thoughts or abstract distress rules out 'Indicator'. The writer's active invitation confirms a current personal desire to die.
   - Following the rule: ""If no desire to die or commit suicide is personally expressed by the author for themselves, consider 'Indicator'""—here, desire is expressed, so not Indicator. Also, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'""—there is no explicit plan, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kms"" (kill myself), ""want to hang myself,"" ""kill myself,"" ""put the rope around my neck,"" ""practice hung.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I am a burden,"" ""liability,"" ""grasping at straws""), fear of failure, and inability to focus on anything except suicide.  
   - Specific method/preparation: Mentions hanging as a method, acquiring a rope, ""practicing"" hanging by placing the rope around their neck and hanging for ""a minute or two.""  
   - Past/recent action: Describes initiating a physical act (""put the rope around my neck,"" hung briefly but stopped).  
   - Imminence: ""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer.""  
   - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""I want to kms,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself"") without stating these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and ""kms."" The author expresses a genuine desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Method (hanging), tool (rope), and preparation (physically placing the rope around the neck and engaging in a ""practice"" hanging).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **very recent, self-initiated action**: ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice’ hung for a minute or two."" This is a concrete, potentially lethal act (hanging) that was interrupted by the author (""stopped"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit desire to die (**Ideation**), specific method/preparation (**Behavior**), **and** a recent initiated action (brief hanging).  
   - The key differentiator is the **initiated action** (""practice hung""), which was potentially lethal and physically enacted, even though stopped. This aligns with the **Attempt** definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... interrupted by self... or failed.""  
   - **Attempt** takes precedence over current ideation/behavior when a concrete past/recent action is described.

I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**:  
     - Explicit expressions of suicidal intent: ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I don't want to be here any more.""  
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm a fucking failure""), despair (""sobbing for hours""), feeling like a burden (""didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden"").  
     - Mentions of a method: Considering a gun (""I've always thought I was going to get a gun"") but uncertainty (""I don't know how exactly,"" ""I don't know though"").  
     - No specific plan, preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note), or timeline beyond general intent.  
     - References to past suicidal ideation (""this job has been making me violently suicidal"") but no description of initiated actions.  
     - Stated desire is unequivocal: ""I want to fucking die.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""I’m finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""I’ll die a failure"" confirm a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method is vaguely referenced (""thought I was going to get a gun"") but explicitly uncertain (""I don’t know how exactly,"" ""I don’t know though"").  
   - **No specific plan, tools, preparations, or imminent timeline**. The gun is a past consideration, not an active plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** (""going to go through with it"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal action**.  
   - Past events involve ideation (""job has been making me violently suicidal"") and emotional distress, not concrete actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Strong desire to die** (rules out *Indicator*).  
   - **No specific plan, method, or preparation** (rules out *Behavior*; gun mention is hypothetical/uncertain).  
   - **No description of past/current initiated lethal action** (rules out *Attempt*).  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no actionable plan or preparations.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions driving to the mountains with ""full intentions to end things"" (explicit suicidal intent and implied method/location).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""people in my life are apathetic about my existing""), escapism (""want to sleep and fast travel... be numb""), and ambivalence (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").  
   - Describes a specific preparatory action: driving to a location (mountains) with suicidal intent.  
   - No description of an *initiated* lethal action (e.g., no mention of starting to jump/take pills).  
   - Explicitly states the action was impulsive and expresses doubt about acting (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""end things"" is a direct phrase implying suicide. Desire is explicit (""full intentions to end things"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Mentions a location (""mountains"") and implies a method (e.g., jumping). Driving there constitutes preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a recent preparatory action (driving to the mountains) but explicitly negates follow-through (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). No lethal action was initiated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific location/method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Attempt"" because no lethal action was initiated (only preparation). Not ""Ideation"" due to the presence of a plan/prep.  
   - Ambivalence (""I don’t think I’m going to do it"") doesn’t override the clear preparatory behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of death (""I'm ready to die"", ""go out the way I want"") and emotional indicators of hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing"", ""Fuck this world""). There are references to specific preparations (""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"") and planning (""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it""). The phrase ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" suggests readiness for action, but no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is detailed. The author expresses a clear desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted. The temporal context involves past planning and current preparations for future action, but no description of an initiated suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""go out the way I want,"" with no negation or indication of distress about unwanted thoughts. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, there is mention of preparations (""Preps being made"") and planning elements like setting and changing a date. While no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is described, the preparations indicate concrete steps toward suicide, leaning toward 'Behavior'. The phrase ""strapped in and ready to go"" is vague but supports readiness for action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past planning (""date was set a while ago"") and current preparations/preparedness, but no initiated action (e.g., no description of a past attempt or recent lethal action). Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die, moving this out of 'Indicator'. The mention of preparations (""Preps being made"") and planning (""date set"") indicates more than just ideation, fitting 'Behavior'. There is no evidence of a past or recent initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The presence of preparations confirms 'Behavior' over 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" indicating suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (hates current course, limited choices), despair (friends ditching them), academic failure, depression, panic attacks, and social isolation.  
   - **No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned for suicide (e.g., no pills, weapons, or notes).  
   - **No past or recent actions** initiated (e.g., no mention of prior suicide attempts).  
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated but lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") or actionable steps.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""ending my life"" show personal desire to die. The author does not negate this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""I’ll do it at X place""), or preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note"") is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on past struggles (academic failure, OCD) and current distress, but **no description of any initiated suicidal action**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""ending my life"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal intent is personal and explicit, not abstract/unwanted.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of method/preparation and no past/recent lethal actions.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains key phrases: ""its working!"" which is vague but could imply an action in progress; ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" suggesting finality or an end; and ""pls let me never wake up"" expressing a direct desire to die (specifically, not waking up, which implies death during sleep). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and a wish for death. 
   - There is no explicit mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). ""Its working!"" might hint at an ongoing action, but it is ambiguous and not specified as a suicidal method. 
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""never wake up"") and imminent (""last post""), but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., taking pills, self-harm) are described. The phrase ""its working!"" could suggest something is happening now, but it lacks detail about what ""it"" is or if it is a concrete suicidal act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""pls let me never wake up"" expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., not wanting to be alive). The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; instead, they reflect a genuine wish to die. Therefore, this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. ""Its working!"" is vague and could refer to various things, but it is not explicitly tied to a suicide method (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, or locations). The ""last post"" could imply a goodbye but is not explicitly a preparation like writing a suicide note. Since there is no explicit plan or method, and the rules state to choose 'Ideation' if unsure, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""never wake up"") and a current state (""its working!""), but it does not describe any past or recent initiated actions that are potentially lethal. For example, there is no description of taking pills, jumping, or other concrete actions that were started. The phrase ""its working!"" might imply an action, but it is not specific enough to qualify as an 'Attempt' (which requires a described, initiated action).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die (""pls let me never wake up""), which rules out 'Indicator'. 
   - There is no explicit plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (e.g., no specific method like overdosing or jumping). 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so it is not 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, with a desire to die but no plan/method, the post fits 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions having pills (42 unnamed pills and allergy medicine) as a method for suicide, describes them as easy to swallow, and explicitly states a plan to act tonight (""tonight im gonna do it""). It expresses a strong desire to die (""im so ready to die"") and hopelessness (referencing past unfulfilled intentions and antidepressants not working). There is no mention of past suicide actions, only past expressions of intent without follow-through. The temporal context is immediate (""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post implies suicide through phrases like ""do it"" in context and explicitly states a desire to die (""im so ready to die""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the writer expresses readiness and intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (pills, including details about type and ease of swallowing), and the writer has the means (""i actually have the means to""). Preparations are indicated by possessing the pills and planning to use them tonight.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight im gonna do it"") with no reference to past or recent initiated lethal actions. Past mentions are only of unfulfilled expressions, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and presence of a plan/method (pills) rules out 'Indicator'. The lack of any initiated lethal action (past or recent) rules out 'Attempt'. The combination of suicidal desire with a specific plan and preparation aligns with 'Behavior'. The mention of having the means and a timeline confirms this, distinguishing it from 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""tired and alone,"" ""unwanted nuisance,"" hopelessness (""I want to be done with everything""), loneliness, and feeling unloved.  
   - Explicitly states: ""kill myself"" as a perceived solution to escape emotional pain.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (time/location), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context: ""More and more often"" suggests recurring thoughts, not imminent action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements include expressions of a strong desire to die (""I really want to check out,"" ""how much I want to check out""), which is a euphemism for suicide. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., ""running on nothing but shear spite,"" ""spite has its limits""). The writer explicitly mentions suicide (""I have no moral problem with suicide"") and reflects on the impact of their death on others, but dismisses concern. There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current feelings and desires. The temporal context is ongoing, with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""soon"" or ""tonight"") specified. The writer's desire to die is genuine but restrained by spite, not by a lack of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in a personal context and uses ""check out"" repeatedly as a clear euphemism for suicide or dying, indicating a direct desire to die. The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they affirm the desire but are held back by spite.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, gathering means) is mentioned. The language is about the desire to act, but no concrete plans or steps are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and desires, with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts). The writer discusses holding on due to spite, but no lethal action was taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal and explicit desire to die/suicide, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which is for distress without suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The core content aligns with 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but no actionable plan.

175,i cant do this anymore. im going to do it. im in so much pain and i cant handle it anymore. i cant. i cant. im done. thank you to the people i met thru this sub. and i hope everyone finds something to live for.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions intense emotional distress (""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain,"" ""i cant handle it anymore,"" ""im done"") and implies an intention to act with ""im going to do it."" The phrase ""do it"" is strongly suggestive of suicide in context, especially combined with the farewell (""thank you to the people... and i hope everyone finds something to live for""), which resembles a goodbye message. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are described. The temporal context is future-oriented (""im going to do it"") but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer expresses a desire to end suffering but does not explicitly state a wish to die or negate suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used. ""Im going to do it"" implies suicidal intent contextually but is not direct. The desire to die is inferred from the distress and farewell, but it is not clearly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die""). There is no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Due to the ambiguity, this leans toward 'Ideation' but must be weighed against the rules (if doubt about genuine desire, 'Indicator' is safer).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The farewell could be interpreted as preparatory, but it is not explicit (e.g., no ""wrote a note"" or ""got the pills""). Without a clear plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""im going to do it"") with no reference to past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses personal distress and implies suicidal intent but lacks explicit suicidal desire or terminology. Phrases like ""im going to do it"" are vague and contextually suggestive of suicide, but the absence of direct suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die"") or a plan/method creates ambiguity. Per the IMPORTANT RULES, if in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose 'Indicator'. Additionally, without a clear plan or method, it cannot be 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Indicator' is the most appropriate category, as the primary sentiment is distress and hopelessness without a clear, current personal expression of suicidal desire.

176,What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?. I know that's it's stupid but I've got a lot of stress right now and it would just be a lot easier. I've also never really seen myself going anywhere in life so. why not.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal language.
   - Emotional indicators include stress (""I've got a lot of stress right now""), hopelessness (""I've also never really seen myself going anywhere in life""), and the perception that suicide would be easier (""it would just be a lot easier"").
   - There is a question about methods (""What Is a mostly painless way to kill myself?""), but no specific method, plan, or preparation (e.g., tools, location, or actions like writing a note) is stated or implied.
   - No references to past actions, such as previous attempts or preparations.
   - No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the question is general.
   - The desire to die is expressed (""kill myself""), but there is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die in the context of distress and hopelessness (e.g., ""it would just be a lot easier,"" ""why not"").
   - There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted). The phrase ""I know that's it's stupid"" acknowledges societal judgment but does not indicate a rejection of the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method is mentioned; the author asks for a ""mostly painless way"" but does not describe or imply having a plan, means, or location.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes, or making arrangements) are present.
   - The inquiry about methods suggests curiosity but does not constitute a plan. Therefore, this lacks the elements for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past events. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to a past attempt or recent action).
   - Thus, there is no evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression of a desire to die (""kill myself"") with suicidal intent places this above 'Indicator' (which requires no clear personal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - With no past or recent initiated action, it cannot be 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts but lacks any indication of a plan or preparations.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: The post discusses ""commit suicide,"" ""overdosing,"" and the process of dying by pills.  
   - Emotional indicators: Focuses on the physical suffering of overdosing but lacks personal expressions of hopelessness or despair.  
   - Plans/methods/preparations: Describes overdosing as a method in detail but does **not** indicate the author is considering it for themselves.  
   - Past actions: No description of the author initiating or attempting suicide.  
   - Imminence: No temporal markers (e.g., ""tonight"") suggesting personal intent.  
   - Stated desire: The author explicitly advises against taking pills (""Don't take the pills""), framing the content as a warning to others.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""commit suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used, but **only in a general/instructional context** (e.g., ""I'm not here to tell you not to commit suicide"").  
   - The author **does not express a personal desire to die**; instead, they emphasize the horrors of overdosing to deter others.  
   - **No personal suicidal desire** is expressed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (pills, overdosing) are discussed, but **not as part of the author’s own plan**.  
   - **No preparations** (e.g., acquiring pills, writing notes) by the author are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes hypothetical outcomes of overdosing (""*You'll* feel fine..."") without referencing past/current actions by the author.  
   - **No initiated or interrupted suicide attempt** by the author is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post educates on suicide methods but **lacks personal desire, plan, or action** from the author.  
   - Suicide is discussed abstractly as a warning to others, fitting **Indicator** (general distress/awareness without personal intent).  
   - **Not Ideation/Behavior/Attempt**: No evidence of the author’s own suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions future suicidal intent (""im positive im gonna do it in the future""), lack of motivation to live, and staying alive only to avoid family sadness. It references a conditional timeline (""when im fed up of this"") but no specific method, tools, location, or preparations. The author reassures they are ""good rn,"" indicating no immediate action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""gonna do it"" (contextually implies suicide) and ""no motivation to keep on living.""  
   - Clear desire to die is expressed (""im positive im gonna do it""), though framed as future-oriented.  
   - No statement negating or rejecting these thoughts as unwanted; the primary sentiment is resignation, not distress about the thoughts themselves.  
   → **Yes, explicit desire to die is present.**

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools mentioned.  
   - No preparations described (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means).  
   - The timeline is vague (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up"").  
   → **No plan/method/preparation indicators.**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intent only (""gonna do it,"" ""in the future"").  
   - No mention of past/current actions (e.g., ""I tried,"" ""I took pills"").  
   → **No initiated action; purely prospective.**

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die and suicidal intent exist, meeting criteria for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Suicidal desire is personal and explicit, ruling out **Indicator** (which requires lack of genuine desire).  
   - Reassurance (""im good rn"") does not negate the expressed intent but supports temporal non-imminence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger and resentment towards the parents for creating a life the author describes as ""psychologically tortured."" Key elements include feelings of being unwanted, uncared for, and existential despair. There are **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations**. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""living a life psychologically tortured"") and perceived burdensomeness (""They could even find the time to care for me"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar.  
   - No stated desire to die, not be alive, or end life (e.g., ""I want to be gone"" is absent).  
   - The distress centers on resentment and suffering, not suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No reference to plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past or imminent actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). Focus is on generalized suffering.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **severe distress and hopelessness** but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - Vague dissatisfaction with life/upbringing without suicidal intent falls under **Indicator**.  
   - Ambiguity about suicidal desire is resolved per rules: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator.""

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes a vivid, terrifying dream about mass murder by foreign men, leading to a severe panic attack upon waking. The author expresses intense fear, anxiety about sleeping, and seeks understanding or coping strategies for such dreams.
   - Key elements include references to violence (e.g., ""slicing up people,"" ""crazed rampage""), emotional distress (e.g., ""severe panic attack,"" ""absolutely terrified,"" ""anxious to sleep""), and the realness of the threat in the dream. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means related to the author themselves.
   - Emotional indicators are present (panic, terror, anxiety), but they stem from an external nightmare scenario, not internal feelings of hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or being a burden in a suicidal context.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or temporal imminence for suicide are mentioned. The focus is on the dream's impact and seeking help for anxiety, not on personal suicidal actions or desires.
   - The author's stated desire is to avoid intense dreams and reduce anxiety, not to express a wish to die or engage in self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive; the distress is about the nightmare and its aftermath, not personal suicidal intent.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of them being unwanted or negated. The content lacks any personal suicidal context.
   - Leaning strongly toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress about an external event (the dream), with no suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The dream involves violence by others, not self-directed harm.
   - Without any suicidal desire or planning elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' or higher.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past dream and current anxiety, but no past or recent suicidal actions by the author are mentioned. The dream is not a self-initiated, potentially lethal action; it is a subconscious experience.
   - No evidence of a concrete suicidal attempt, interrupted or otherwise.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress (panic, fear, sleep anxiety) due to a nightmare, but it lacks a personal, current expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, preparation, or past attempt.
   - This fits 'Indicator': The author is discussing abstract violence and personal anxiety without any suicidal intent. If there were ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' would be chosen, but here there is no ambiguity—suicide is not referenced at all.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no suicidal plan or preparation mentioned.
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past or recent suicidal action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose,"" indicating a specific past suicidal action. It expresses emotional distress like ""fear and despair,"" ""suffering,"" and hopelessness about the afterlife (""i don't want to believe theres nothing""). The phrase ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" and ""please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering"" suggests a current desire to end suffering, potentially through suicide, but no specific future plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The overdose on purpose is a clear reference to a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""end this suffering"" and ""do it"" (in context) imply a desire to die, but this is conditional on having ""something to believe in"" or a ""reason."" The past action ""overdosed... on purpose"" confirms explicit suicidal intent for that event. For current state, the desire is not negated as unwanted; it's presented as a plea for motivation, leaning towards current ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (""overdosed"") is mentioned, but only in the context of a past action. There is no indication of a current plan, method, or preparation for future suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent steps described). The focus is on needing a reason to act, not on active planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""overdosed... on purpose"") as a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. It also alludes to current suicidal thoughts (""i just need something... so i can do it""), but no current or future action is initiated or described beyond expressing a desire.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The past overdose ""on purpose"" meets the definition of 'Attempt' as it was a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. Even though the post includes current distress and implied ideation, the 'Attempt' category takes precedence because the past action is clearly described and concrete. This overrides any current 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan) or 'Behavior' (no current plan/method). 'Indicator' is not appropriate due to the explicit past suicidal action and current desire.

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal again,"" indicating current suicidal thoughts. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I thought I was getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again""), distress about being a burden (""I'm hurting my significant other... I'm scared to stress him even more""), and situational stressors (running out of meds, lack of response from doctors/pharmacy). 
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to running out of meds is related to treatment, not as a suicide method. 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. 
   - The temporal context is present-focused (""I'm suicidal again""), with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). 
   - The desire to die is implied by ""suicidal,"" but not explicitly negated (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal,"" which directly relates to suicide. 
   - It expresses a clear personal desire to die or not be alive through the phrase ""I'm suicidal again,"" as this term implies current suicidal thoughts or feelings. 
   - There is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or tools are mentioned. 
   - No preparations (e.g., writing a note, saying goodbye) are described. 
   - The absence of a plan, method, or preparation means this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal again"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt). 
   - Since no concrete, potentially lethal action was taken or initiated, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal again"") indicates a desire to die, placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear desire or unwanted thoughts). 
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior'. 
   - No past or recent action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions. 
   - Although there is distress, the lack of negation of suicidal desire and the direct statement ""I'm suicidal"" make 'Ideation' more appropriate than 'Indicator' (per rules: if ambiguous desire, choose 'Indicator', but here the explicit term ""suicidal"" reduces ambiguity).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong emotional distress, including anxiety, hopelessness (""I can't handle the fact that she thinks I'm worthless,"" ""I can't have this life it's too painful""), and feelings of failure. It explicitly mentions a desire to die: ""now I want to die more than ever."" There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions related to suicide. The context is about worsening mental health due to family interactions and medication, but no suicidal behavior or attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it does express a clear personal desire to die with ""I want to die more than ever,"" indicating genuine suicidal intent. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). This leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye) are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and desire, not planning. Without any plan/method, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and a recent interaction with the author's mother, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to initiated attempts like taking pills or self-harm). Phrases like ""I want to die more than ever"" indicate present ideation, not completed actions. 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""I want to die more than ever"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of such intent. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No description of past or recent initiated lethal actions rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear, personal desire to die without specific plans or behaviors.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicide by hanging"" as a specific method.
   - References preparation: ""ive alr tied the noose,"" indicating a concrete step taken.
   - Emotional indicators: Ambivalence (""im still not sure"") and a request for honesty about the experience, but no explicit expressions of hopelessness or despair.
   - No reference to past suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an actual hanging attempt).
   - No stated time frame for imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Stated desire: The writer is inquiring about the method and has prepared, but expresses uncertainty, not a clear, current wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging.""
   - It implies personal consideration of suicide through the query and preparation, but the desire is not directly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die""). The uncertainty (""still not sure"") suggests ambivalence rather than a firm intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method: ""suicide by hanging"" is named.
   - Preparation: ""ive alr tied the noose"" confirms a tangible preparatory action (acquiring/readying means).
   - This clearly indicates planning elements, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes a past preparatory action (""tied the noose""), but not a lethal action (e.g., no mention of initiating hanging).
   - No description of a past or recent suicidal act that was initiated and potentially lethal, so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit suicide mention and preparation place this beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire or intent).
   - The presence of a method and preparation rules out 'Ideation' (which involves desire/thoughts without plan or preparation).
   - The action described (tying the noose) is preparatory, not an initiated lethal act, so it is not an 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it includes suicidal thoughts/consideration combined with specific preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I want to die"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts and a personal desire to die due to distressing feelings about being a ""pervert."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair about uncontrollable sexual feelings, but no specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. 
   - There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts; the statement ""I've never done anything wrong or illegal"" refers to general behavior, not suicide-related actions. 
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The desire to die is expressed directly and personally, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this"").

   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die because of them""). There is no negation or statement that these thoughts are unwanted; the language indicates a current, personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied. The focus is on the desire and questioning (""Should I kill myself?""), not on how or when it might be carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past events. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt or recent action that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expressions of suicidal desire (""I want to die,"" ""kill myself"") indicate personal suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity or lack of genuine desire). 
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No description of past or recent initiated lethal actions rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, this aligns with 'Ideation': explicit personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

186,"i hate my dad. i hate my family so much i hate my dad he loves to choose his family over my siblings every fucking time he leaves us and comes back like nothing happened, god he loves his shitty pedo father who sexuality assaulted me at a young age i hate him so much my mom deserves so much better i hate everything i just wanna end it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense anger and hatred towards family members, particularly the father, and references past trauma (sexual assault). The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" suggests a desire to cease living, which implies suicidal intent. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (""i hate everything""), but no specific mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm. The phrase ""end it"" is a common euphemism for suicide but lacks detail on how, when, or any concrete steps. No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. The desire to ""end it"" appears genuine and not explicitly unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a direct and personal expression implying a desire to die, especially in the context of distress. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). Thus, there is a clear, current desire to die, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is vague and does not imply a plan. Without any details on how the action would be carried out, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and a present desire to ""end it,"" with references to past family events (e.g., assault) but no description of any self-initiated, potentially lethal suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of past attempts, even if interrupted or failed). Thus, there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (""i just wanna end it""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. However, it lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The absence of a concrete past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. While the post shows distress, the explicit personal wish to ""end it"" means it does not fit 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' requires a lack of clear suicidal desire or an explicit statement that thoughts are unwanted. Here, the desire is present but unspecific, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses past feelings of being unable to cope and mentions being ""on the brink of suicide"" historically.  
   - It explicitly references suicide as a past alternative but emphasizes choosing vagrancy (""going hobo"") instead.  
   - No current expressions of hopelessness, desire to die, or burden. Instead, the tone is reflective and solution-focused (vagrancy as a coping strategy).  
   - No mention of current suicidal plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent.  
   - The author states they are currently ""a functional member of society"" and frames vagrancy as a past/potential *alternative* to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned explicitly (""on the brink of suicide""), but **not as a current personal desire**. The context is historical (""in my life,"" ""past"") and framed as an avoided outcome.  
   - The author expresses **no current desire to die**; instead, they advocate for vagrancy as a life-preserving alternative.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. Vagrancy is discussed as an *alternative action*, not a suicidal behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Suicidal feelings are described as past experiences (""on two occasions,"" ""in the past"").  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). The author only references *avoiding* suicide via vagrancy.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post references suicide abstractly/historically as a risk the author overcame, not as a current desire or plan.  
   - The primary focus is sharing a coping strategy to help others, with **no personal expression of current suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Discusses suicide as a past risk but lacks current personal desire, intent, or planning. The tone is proactive (offering alternatives) and lacks despair.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""end it"" which strongly implies suicide. Expresses hopelessness (""I can't go on anymore""), despair (""I fucked up my life""), isolation, and anhedonia (""I miss being happy""). 
   - Explicitly states a future suicidal action (""tonight I'm just gonna... end it""). 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is detailed, but ""drunk in my basement"" implies intoxication may be part of the plan. 
   - No past actions/attempts are described. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - ""End it"" is a direct suicide reference. ""I can't go on anymore"" confirms desire to cease living. **Yes**. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - A timeframe (""tonight"") and implied method (being ""drunk"" may lower inhibitions/be part of means) are present. ""I'm drunk in my basement"" indicates current state and potential preparation. **Leans toward Behavior**. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Focuses on future intent (""tonight""). No past/initiated actions described. **Not Attempt**. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific timeframe (""tonight"") + implied preparation (current intoxication in isolated location) = **Behavior**. Though no weapon/pill specifics, the contextual readiness (drunk, alone, imminent timing) exceeds Ideation.

189,"I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen. Will I be able to successfully end my life? I'm fairly short, male and 56 kg.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - It specifies a method: using 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen for overdose, and provides personal details (height, weight, gender) to assess lethality.
   - There is no expression of emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness or despair) beyond the suicidal inquiry.
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on a potential future act.
   - The question ""Will I be able to..."" implies planning and preparation, as the user possesses the means (codeine) and has access to additional substances (ibuprofen).
   - The desire to die is clear from the context, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the question about success shows a genuine desire to die, not just abstract or unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (overdose using codeine and ibuprofen) is mentioned.
   - Yes, preparations are indicated by having 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen, demonstrating acquisition of means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of taking pills or other steps). It is forward-looking, asking about future potential.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method/preparation align with 'Behavior'.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal desire to die, not just distress or abstract thoughts.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a plan/method is explicitly present.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no concrete, initiated action (past or recent) is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions resisting ""the desire to end"" and despair (""i cant live like this,"" ""i never been happy since birth"").
   - Expresses hopelessness (""failed everything,"" ""wasted [life],"" ""not happy or enjoying anything"") and isolation (""nobody understands"").
   - **No explicit references to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions**.
   - The phrase ""resisting the desire to end"" implies **unwanted** suicidal thoughts without a current desire to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - ""Desire to end"" suggests suicidal thoughts but is framed as resisted/unwanted. The primary sentiment is distress about suffering, not a stated intent to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes chronic suffering (""whole life resisting"") but **no past or recent suicidal actions**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core is distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts (""resisting the desire to end""), without explicit personal desire to die, plan, or action.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expressions of despair and passive thoughts of ending life, explicitly countered by resistance.  
   - Not *Ideation*: Lacks clear, current desire to die (thoughts are resisted).  
   - No elements of *Behavior* (plan/method) or *Attempt* (past action).

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" as a future possibility (""will probably commit suicide eventually"").  
   - Emotional context: Focuses on the difficulty of communicating suicidal intentions to loved ones, implying resignation or hopelessness.  
   - **No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - The phrasing ""probably"" and ""eventually"" suggests non-immediacy and lack of concrete planning.  
   - The writer expresses a personal desire to die but frames it as a future likelihood, not an immediate intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""commit suicide"" in a personal context.  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a clear desire to die (""will probably commit suicide eventually"").  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, or preparation** is specified (e.g., no details about *how*, *where*, or *when* beyond ""eventually"").  
   - Asking ""how to tell people"" is a communication concern, not a suicidal preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Refers to a **future intention** (""will probably commit suicide eventually"").  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit and personal**, ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is mentioned, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is a **stated desire to die via suicide** without actionable details → **Ideation**.

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""the voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself,"" which references suicide directly. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm losing grip with it all,"" ""it's just getting worse""), despair (""I don't know who to turn to,"" ""I can't cope with his own mistakes""), and distress (""I can't stop crying""). The author expresses a clear personal desire not to die: ""I wanna see my daughters grow up."" There is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), preparation (e.g., note-writing), or past/current suicidal actions. The suicidal thoughts are attributed to external ""voices"" and are explicitly unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. However, the author states a personal desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up"") and frames the suicidal thoughts as coming from ""voices,"" indicating they are distressing but not desired. This negates a genuine current wish to die, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to ""end myself"" is vague and lacks concrete details about how or when it might happen. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past financial mistakes but no past or recent suicidal actions. It focuses on current emotional distress and unwanted thoughts, with no description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted and not the author's personal desire (e.g., ""voices"" telling him vs. his own wish to live). This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts without a genuine desire to die. There is no plan/method (ruling out 'Behavior') and no described action (ruling out 'Attempt'). Ambiguity about desire is resolved by the author's clear statement against dying, so 'Indicator' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses moving on from an abusive relationship and expresses hope for future support and self-sufficiency. Key phrases include ""i'm not okay right now"" indicating current distress, and ""maybe i don't need to die"" which references death but frames it as unnecessary. 
   - There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional indicators include vulnerability (""i'm not okay right now"") but are countered by hope and resilience (""i can be okay,"" ""a hopeful thought"").
   - The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" implies a past consideration of death but explicitly negates it, showing no current desire for death. Imminence or plans are absent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - The only death-related phrase (""maybe i don't need to die"") expresses a lack of desire to die, not a wish for death. It frames death as unwanted or unnecessary.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated; instead, the reference to death is abstract and negated, leaning toward distress about life circumstances without suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), plans, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. The content focuses on emotional reflection, not actionable suicide-related behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings (""i'm not okay right now"") and future hopes, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" suggests a general reflection, not an initiated or interrupted action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and references death abstractly (""maybe i don't need to die""), but it lacks a clear, current, personal desire to die. The primary sentiment is hope and resilience, with death framed as unnecessary. 
   - No explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts are present. The negation of death (""don't need to die"") and absence of desire align with 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and references death in the context of asking about the lethality of taking 3 Xanax pills (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?""). 
   - Emotional indicators include boredom triggering suicidal thoughts, but the author states ""i dont wanna die rn"" (right now), indicating a lack of current desire to die. 
   - There is a specific method mentioned (taking 3 Xanax pills), but it is framed as a means to ""be calm"" due to boredom, not as a suicide plan. The author also insists, ""i will do it anyway,"" referring to taking the pills for calming purposes, not suicide. 
   - No references to past suicide actions, attempts, or preparations (e.g., no note, no acquisition of means for suicide). 
   - Imminence is present for taking the pills (""rn""), but it is not tied to suicidal intent. 
   - The author's stated desire is clear: they do not want to die (""i dont wanna die rn"") and are expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts that occur when bored.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts."" 
   - However, the author negates any current desire to die with ""i dont wanna die rn,"" framing the suicidal thoughts as unwanted and not representing a genuine wish to act. This leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts, not an intent to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (taking 3 Xanax pills) is mentioned, but it is not presented as part of a suicide plan; instead, it is for calming down due to boredom. The author separates this action from suicidal intent, asking about potential risks without expressing a desire to die from it. 
   - No preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no suicide note, no gathering means for suicide). 
   - Since the method is not linked to suicidal intent and the desire to die is negated, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. If unsure, the guidance is to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior', but here the context shows no suicidal plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a future action (taking pills) but not as a suicide attempt. The action is intended for symptom relief, not self-harm. 
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal actions are mentioned (e.g., no reference to prior attempts). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they do not want to die (""i dont wanna die rn""), indicating the thoughts are unwanted and not accompanied by a current desire to act. This aligns with 'Indicator' (general distress or unwanted thoughts without personal suicidal intent).
   - The mention of a method (Xanax) is not tied to suicide planning, so it does not elevate to 'Behavior'. The absence of desire or plan rules out 'Ideation' and 'Behavior'. No past actions support 'Attempt'.
   - Given the explicit negation of suicidal desire and the focus on distress, 'Indicator' is the best fit. Per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguous desire, choose 'Indicator'—here, desire is clearly negated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""i will wait until I can kill myself"" and ""if he is dead.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme guilt (""i am a fucking monster,"" ""piece of human garbage""), hopelessness (""I don’t know what to do""), and self-loathing.  
   - Self-harm request: Asks for advice on hidden self-harm locations (""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing"").  
   - Imminence: Suicide intent is conditional (""if he is dead"") and future-oriented (""wait until"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states a desire to die (""kill myself"") without negation or expression of unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""kill myself"" and contextual desire to die if a specific outcome occurs.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Self-harm request implies a method/plan for self-harm, but **suicide** is only mentioned conditionally with no specific method, tools, or preparations described (e.g., no pills, weapons, or notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt). The suicide statement is future-tense and hypothetical. Self-harm is queried but not acted upon.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicide-specific elements**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - **Distinguishing factors**:  
     - Self-harm request is a *behavior* but is distinct from suicidal behavior. The suicide intent lacks a plan/method/preparation (e.g., ""wait until I can kill myself"" is vague).  
     - No concrete suicidal action (past or present) rules out *Attempt*.  
     - Explicit desire to die rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Conclusion**: The core suicide risk is **Ideation** (desire to die without plan/method). Self-harm query is concerning but separate; suicide classification prioritizes the explicit suicidal statement.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself soon,"" ""really strong urge to lately,"" ""wish I wasn't even born.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""people don't care,"" ""don't make effort""), despair (""life is fucking stupid"").
   - Mentions future intention (""soon"") but **no specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.
   - Desire to die is explicit and personal (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""wish I wasn't born"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: Directly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a desire to not exist (""wish I wasn't even born"").
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act""). Primary sentiment is active desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) mentioned.
   - General urgency (""soon"") but lacks concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on future intent (""soon,"" ""going to"") with no description of past/initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""kill myself,"" ""wish I wasn’t born"") → Rules out 'Indicator'.
   - **No method/plan/preparation** mentioned → Rules out 'Behavior'.
   - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** → Rules out 'Attempt'.

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""plummet to the ground,"" which implies suicide by jumping, a specific method. It also references ""go to the highest floor,"" indicating a location. Emotional indicators include ""tempted"" (suggesting desire), ""guilt or fear,"" and ambivalence about outcomes (e.g., fear of surviving injured). There is no mention of past actions, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The desire is conflicted due to fear and guilt, but the temptation to act is present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""plummet to the ground"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, indicating a personal desire to die. The writer expresses temptation (""so tempted"") but also hesitation, yet there is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., ""I don't want to act on this""). Thus, it leans away from 'Indicator' and shows genuine suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (jumping/plummeting) and location (highest floor) are mentioned, which constitutes a plan. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the method and location are explicit, aligning with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses a future intention (""so tempted to just go"") with no reference to past or recent actions. It is hypothetical and contemplative, not describing any initiated, potentially lethal action. Thus, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (temptation to die) with a specific method/location (jumping from a high floor) moves this from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. The ambivalence (fear, guilt) does not negate the plan; it only highlights internal conflict. Since a method is clearly stated, and no action has been taken, 'Behavior' is the best fit. Rules emphasize that if a plan/method is present, it should be 'Behavior', and uncertainty would default to 'Ideation', but here the method is explicit.

198,"If I deeply hurt my boyfriend, he wont feel that bad if I kill myself. Any thoughts?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include implied hopelessness or guilt (e.g., the idea that hurting the boyfriend would make her suicide less impactful, suggesting feelings of being a burden).
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past actions or attempts.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the statement is conditional and speculative.
   - The writer's desire is not explicitly stated as a current wish to die; instead, it's framed hypothetically (""if I kill myself"") and seeks external input (""Any thoughts?""), which may indicate distress or contemplation rather than intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct suicide-related phrase.
   - However, the desire to die is not clearly expressed as current or genuine; it is conditional (""if I deeply hurt my boyfriend... he wont feel that bad if I kill myself""). This framing suggests a hypothetical scenario rather than a personal affirmation of intent.
   - There is no explicit statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want to act on this""). The ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator' when uncertain about genuine desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks detail.
   - Without any indication of planning, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario with no reference to past or recent actions. It does not describe any initiated, potentially lethal behavior (e.g., no mention of trying something and failing or being stopped).
   - Thus, it cannot be classified as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts personally (""I kill myself"") but frames them conditionally, creating ambiguity about genuine current desire. There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Per the rules: When there is doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (e.g., hypothetical phrasing without clear intent), 'Indicator' should be chosen. The primary sentiment here appears to be distress (e.g., relationship conflict and its impact) rather than an explicit, personal desire to die.
   - Therefore, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

199,"How does no one notice when I'm standing on the ledge of a hospital parking garage?. I can never get the nerve to jump. But I'll stand there. Or sit there. Sometimes for an hour. Trying to work up the nerve. No one has ever stopped. The last time, someone came out of the elevator looked at me and kept walking, got into their car and left. Do hospitals even have security? This is the same hospital where 6 years ago someone took their life the same way. I get that if I wanted to die I would have already jumped, maybe that's true. But I can't help it. I go hoping I'll gain the courage or maybe, just maybe someone will stop me and someone will show me they care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author describes repeatedly going to a hospital parking garage ledge with the intention to jump (""standing on the ledge,"" ""trying to work up the nerve to jump"").  
   - Specific method mentioned: **jumping** from a height.  
   - Preparations: Physically going to the location, standing/sitting on the ledge for extended periods (""sometimes for an hour"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""no one has ever stopped""), hopelessness (""do hospitals even have security?""), and conflict between desire to die and hope for intervention (""hoping [...] someone will stop me"").  
   - No description of a past initiated lethal action (e.g., they did not jump). References to others’ suicides are not personal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, desire to die is explicit (""if I wanted to die I would have already jumped"") and tied directly to the act of jumping.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: Jumping (explicitly stated).  
   - **Preparation**: Repeated visits to the location, positioning themselves on the ledge.  
   - This elevates the risk beyond mere thoughts.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **recurrent preparatory behavior** (going to the ledge, attempting to gather courage).  
   - No description of a past or recent **initiated lethal action** (e.g., they did not jump, fall, or take steps to jump).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (jumping) + preparations (repeatedly going to the ledge) = **Behavior**.  
   - Not **Attempt**: No initiated lethal action occurred (e.g., leaning to jump, falling).  
   - Not **Ideation**: Plan/method/preparation is present.  
   - Not **Indicator**: Desire to die is explicit and personal.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions multiple past suicide attempts (using a phone charger, joining military to die in combat).
   - Expresses current hopelessness (""my death seems the ultimate answer""), feeling like a burden, and deteriorating life circumstances.
   - Explicitly references recent research into suicide methods (""searching about ways to kill myself... look like an accident"").
   - Notes barriers to help-seeking (phone anxiety) and ongoing concealment of distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts on my life,"" and ""ways to kill myself"" confirm a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Past**: Specific methods attempted (phone charger as ligature, military combat death plan).
   - **Current**: Actively researching methods to make suicide appear accidental (though unsuccessful).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **past concrete actions** with potentially lethal methods (phone charger attempt).
   - Current ideation includes planning/research but no initiated lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Past actions (phone charger attempt) qualify as *initiated, potentially lethal acts*, meeting the 'Attempt' definition.
   - Current suicidal research ('Behavior') is secondary to the explicit description of past attempts. 'Attempt' takes precedence per rules when a concrete past action is described.
   - No ambiguity: The post confirms the author personally engaged in life-threatening self-harm.

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions strong emotional distress: ""nobody cares about me,"" ""more dead inside,"" ""done with everything,"" ""done trying my best.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I dont understand why nobody cares""), despair (""im done being played with""), and feelings of worthlessness.  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations**.  
   - Phrases like ""more dead inside"" are metaphorical, indicating emotional numbness, not literal death/suicide.  
   - **No temporal urgency** (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") or past actions related to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die.  
   - ""Dead inside"" and ""done with everything"" reflect emotional exhaustion, not a stated wish to end life.  
   - **No** mention of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing emotional pain, **not** past/future suicidal actions.  
   - **No** description of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, and feeling ""dead inside,"" but **lacks personal desire to die, plans, methods, or actions**.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Expresses despair without explicit suicidal intent or behaviors.  
   - Rule: *""If no desire to die is personally expressed, choose Indicator.""*

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""jump off"" and ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" which implies a specific method of self-harm (suicide by jumping). 
   - Emotional indicators include fear (""less scary"") and the building of courage to act, suggesting determination.
   - Specific method and location are detailed: jumping from the bedroom window, with the environment (trees and mud) reducing fear.
   - Preparation is indicated by ""getting more courage,"" showing psychological readiness.
   - Imminence is present with ""Hopefully I can do it soon,"" indicating near-future intent.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to carry out the action, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump off"" and ""jump out"" in this context strongly imply a lethal self-directed action.
   - It expresses a genuine desire to die, as seen in the active encouragement to act (""I think I can,"" ""getting more courage,"" ""hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - No statement negates the desire (e.g., no expression of not wanting these thoughts), so it leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from a bedroom window.
   - The location is specified, and the writer considers environmental factors (trees and mud) to facilitate the action.
   - Psychological preparation (""getting more courage"") is evident.
   - This indicates a plan, so it leans towards 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intent (""I can,"" ""soon""), with no description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no mention of a previous attempt or action that was started).
   - Since no concrete, potentially lethal action has been taken, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire and a specific method (jumping from a window) rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The detailed method and preparation elements go beyond mere thoughts of dying, ruling out 'Ideation'.
   - The lack of any described initiated action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, with a clear plan/method and preparation, the post fits 'Behavior'. The imminence (""soon"") and specificity support this.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses struggles with depression, family dynamics, and reluctance to seek help. Key elements include:
   - Mentions ""writing suicide notes"" during severe depressive episodes.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""depression hits really hard,"" feeling like a burden to therapists) and isolation.
   - No explicit mention of death/suicide methods, timelines, or active preparations beyond note-writing.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., no description of initiating self-harm).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - The note-writing implies suicidal thoughts but lacks a stated *current desire to die*. The context frames it as a passive consequence of depression (""next thing I know"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - ""Writing suicide notes"" is a preparatory behavior, but no specific method (e.g., pills, location) or *plan* to act is mentioned. The notes are described retrospectively during depressive lows.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Notes are written during past depressive episodes (""sometimes... I'm writing""), not as part of an imminent plan. No initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Suicidal thoughts (note-writing) are present but framed as unwanted outcomes of depression, not a current intent.
   - No desire to die is explicitly stated; the focus is distress about isolation/help-seeking.
   - Preparatory behavior (notes) exists but lacks a plan/method, leaning toward **Ideation**. However, the notes are not tied to imminent risk, and the primary sentiment is distress about mental state (not active suicidal intent). Per rules: *""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""*

**Conclusion**: The core issue is distress and depressive symptoms, with suicidal thoughts mentioned indirectly as a symptom. The absence of explicit desire, plan, or action supports **Indicator**.

People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""hope i die"" and ""fuck me fuck da world,"" indicating a personal desire for death. It includes emotional indicators like ""suffering mentally,"" ""all depressed,"" and expressions of hopelessness (e.g., ""No one cares not even me""). There are references to death (""People dying is funny,"" ""hope that asshole dies,"" ""hope i die""), but no specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions are described. The tone is sarcastic and self-deprecating (e.g., ""maybe i just need attention""), but the desire for death appears genuine in the context of despair. No imminence is indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it expresses a clear personal desire to die through phrases like ""hope i die"" and ""fuck me fuck da world."" The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or negate the desire (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to die""). This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, guns), plan, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The references to death are vague and wishful, not actionable. Without any plan/method, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and wishes (e.g., ""hope i die"") but does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no initiated attempts like ""I tried to overdose""). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""hope i die""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire). The lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No described actions rule out 'Attempt'. Sarcasm (e.g., ""hehe,"" ""funny"") does not negate the expressed desire, and there is no ambiguity strong enough to default to 'Indicator' (per guidelines). Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""cut,"" which could refer to self-harm (e.g., cutting oneself). ""To deep"" appears to be a misspelling of ""too deep,"" indicating the action was excessive or severe. The word ""fuck"" conveys distress or frustration. There is no explicit mention of death, dying, or suicide. Emotional indicators include distress but not explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden. The phrase ""just cut"" suggests a recent action, but no specific plan, method (beyond the implied act of cutting), or preparations (e.g., notes) are detailed. The temporal context is immediate (""just""), implying a past or very recent event. There is no stated desire to die or expression of suicidal intent; the focus is on the action and its outcome (""too deep"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. No clear desire to die is expressed (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die""). The post describes an action (""cut"") but does not frame it in the context of suicidal intent. Without explicit suicidal desire or context, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (cutting) is implied, but it is not explicitly tied to suicide. There is no indication of planning (e.g., acquiring tools, choosing a location) or preparation for a suicidal act. The action is described as completed (""just cut""), but without suicidal context, it may represent non-suicidal self-injury. Since no plan or suicidal method is clearly stated, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past/recent action (""just cut"") that was initiated. However, it does not specify that this action was intended as a suicidal act or was potentially lethal in a suicidal context. ""Too deep"" could imply severity, but without suicidal intent, it may reflect accidental or non-suicidal self-harm. No concrete, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to kill myself by cutting"") is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress and references self-harm but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. It falls under 'Indicator' because it shows general distress without clear current suicidal ideation. Although a method (cutting) is mentioned, it is not explicitly linked to suicide, and there is no plan or preparation described. The action itself is ambiguous and could be non-suicidal. Given the ambiguity and absence of suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is appropriate based on the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.
   - Focus is on criticizing others' insincerity, not describing personal suicidal intent or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die. 
   - **No statements** about wanting to be dead or not be alive.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""wanna die"" but immediately follows with ""but dont at the same time,"" showing ambivalence and lack of genuine desire to act.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""everything boring""), isolation (""friends left,"" ""bullied""), functional impairment (""struggle to get up,"" stopped school).  
   - **No specific method, plan, preparation, location, or timeline** mentioned.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" increasing over time and a daily feeling of wanting to ""justify dying."" The author references ""partially planning to die"" but does not specify any methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""every single day I feel terrible""), anxiety, depression, and feeling like a burden. There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm). The temporal context is ongoing (""thinking about it most of the time for the past few months"") without imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The author expresses conflict about sharing these thoughts but no explicit rejection of the desire to die (e.g., no ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and wanting to ""justify dying,"" indicating a personal desire to die. The phrase ""partially planning to die"" reinforces suicidal intent. There is no statement explicitly negating this desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The author states they lack ""strong and reliable methods"" and only reference ""partially planning,"" which is vague and non-actionable. Mentions of impulsivity do not equate to a concrete plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes ongoing suicidal thoughts over months but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried X yesterday""). The focus is on contemplation, not behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and personal suicidal thoughts qualify for 'Ideation.' The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior.' No past/recent lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt.' While distress is present, the clear suicidal desire moves this beyond 'Indicator.'

209,"they took the last bit of stability i have. i just got laid off from my well paying, work from home, low stress, work at your own pace, non-entry level job on wednesday. they took the last bit of stability i have in my life. i live alone because my ex was an abusive pos who i escaped so i have no partner to help keep me afloat till i find something new. i can't rely on my mom because she just lost her job too and im too prideful to tell my dad i don't have a job anymore. i'm also in school which i may have to withdraw from. i lost everything that made me feel comfortable in life in a 5 minute zoom call. i can't ever find a job that pays as much because my role was very specific to the company and is not widely available elsewhere. it's also not something i can use as a marketable skill elsewhere. my life has always been shit but being able to finally support myself was the only thing that made me feel okay about being me. but i guess my ex was right about me, i'm an ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead. and now its gone. and likely won't come back for years and years and years, if ever. i'm so tired of having everything decent or good in my life taken from me. theres no fucking reason to keep playing this bullshit game. its just struggle and work and work and work and then when you finally get something positive out of life it's ripped away from you. i'm just an ugly 27 year old woman with no degree, no partner, no job, no reason to keep going. ever since i was a kid i knew living was a total fucking scam and yet i was too scared to end it for the sake of other people and my own fears. now i really don't care any more. my parents are the reason i have to suffer, why should i care about them? they didnt care about my future to invest in it when they had the means to, why should i care about their emotional state?. i've been thinking i could just drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself. then i can rest in peace.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness, despair, and feelings of being a burden (""ugly useless stupid girl who is better off dead,"" ""no reason to keep going""). It details recent traumatic life events (job loss, isolation, financial instability) and explicitly mentions suicidal intent (""end it,"" ""better off dead""). Crucially, it specifies a method (""hang myself"") and a plan (""drive out into the mountains and hike as long as i can from paths and find a nice little spot to hang myself""). There is no description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself"" or similar).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states personal suicidal intent (""better off dead,"" ""end it,"" ""hang myself"").  
   - The desire to die is clear and current, not framed as unwanted thoughts (e.g., no negation like ""but I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, a specific method (""hang myself"") and plan (driving to the mountains, hiking off-path to find a secluded spot) are described. This indicates preparation beyond mere ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal plan is framed as a future intention (""I’ve been thinking I could..."").  
   - **No** description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried to hang myself yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die + specific method/plan (""hang myself"" + detailed location/preparation) meets the criteria for **Behavior**.  
   - While despair and hopelessness are severe, the presence of a concrete plan elevates it beyond **Ideation** (which lacks a plan).  
   - **Attempt** does not apply because no past/recent initiated lethal action is described.  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit personal suicidal intent and planning.

210,I want to be dead. I don't enjoy anything. I am lonely. I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants. I am not healing. It is terrible. I don't want to live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct statements like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" which indicate a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators are present, such as anhedonia (""I don't enjoy anything""), loneliness, and hopelessness (""I am not healing""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). No past actions or attempts are described, and there is no temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer mentions seeking therapy and taking antidepressants, which shows help-seeking behavior but does not negate the expressed desire to die. The primary sentiment is a current, personal wish for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore."" These are clear, personal expressions of suicidal intent. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' and points to at least 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. There is no reference to tools, substances, locations, or any steps taken toward acting on suicidal thoughts. The absence of these elements means this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past actions. There is no mention of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable, as no concrete, potentially lethal action is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to be dead"") places this beyond 'Indicator', which requires no clear personal suicidal intent. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. No past or recent action is described, so it cannot be 'Attempt'. Thus, the post fits 'Ideation', as it expresses a personal desire to die without specifics on how or when it might be carried out.

211,"its supposed to get better but i want to know when. I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like I'm doing everything people say they do to get better but it's just not working. I take care of my body: I workout 5-7 times a week, I sleep 8-10 hrs a night, I eat nutritious meals. I'm part of a prestigious grad program for my field, one that I should be proud of and is undeniably an accomplishment. I volunteer regularly with womens groups and lgbtq groups. I'm on medication and I see a therapist weekly. When I'm sad, I journal, I use DBT skills, I try to fight cognitive distortions. But I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal. People say to wait it out, but its been years. Day in day out, I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts. Its supposed to get better but I just want to know when. I read so many articles and videos and posts about people that have recovered from being suicidal and I just don't get why I'm plagued with this. I'm doing all the same things. Its so hard to have any hope or motivation to go on when I dont even know what else to try at this point. I'm just tired of all of it.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""I am constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""it's just not working,"" ""hard to have any hope""), despair (""I don't know what to do anymore""), and exhaustion (""I'm just tired of all of it"").
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., when, where, how), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past actions, such as initiated suicide attempts, are present. The focus is on ongoing thoughts and feelings over years.
   - Imminence is not indicated; the suicidal thoughts are described as persistent but not immediate (e.g., ""day in day out,"" ""it's been years"").
   - The writer expresses a current personal struggle with suicidal thoughts but does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to die. Instead, the tone conveys frustration and hopelessness about not improving despite efforts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" multiple times and describes constant suicidal thoughts.
   - Yes, the phrase ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" indicates a clear, personal desire not to be alive, framed as an ongoing state.
   - No, the writer does not explicitly negate the desire or state that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this""). This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation are present (e.g., no references to notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means).
   - The absence of any plan or method means this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current and persistent suicidal thoughts, not past events. Temporal references are to long-term struggles (""it's been years"").
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of past attempts, even if interrupted or failed). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die through explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action means 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The core of the post is the author's explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and desire without actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation' best. The mention of therapeutic efforts (e.g., DBT skills, therapy) does not change the category, as they reflect coping rather than a negation of suicidal intent.

I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore so I really need it but idk what to di,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions depression, anxiety, lack of motivation, and fear of parental judgment.  
    - Expresses hopelessness (""fucked up self"") and functional impairment (""don't even have the motivation to get up"").  
    - **No references** to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
    - Focuses solely on distress about mental health and barriers to accessing therapy.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or desire to die.  
    - Distress is centered on untreated mental health, not a wish to cease living.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
    - **Absent**. No mention of suicidal plans, tools, locations, or preparatory actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
    - Describes current emotional state and obstacles to therapy.  
    - **No references** to past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - Expresses hopelessness and impaired functioning (**distress indicators**).  
    - **No desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions** → does not meet criteria for *Ideation*, *Behavior*, or *Attempt*.  
    - Fits **Indicator**: Distress about mental health without personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly, but the writer states they ""try to suppress"" them and ""really don't want to have to do that,"" indicating resistance and lack of genuine desire to act.
   - A specific method (using eye drops) is referenced, but it is framed as an unwanted ""idea"" triggered by a video, not as a personal plan or preparation. The phrase ""gave me an idea"" suggests contemplation rather than intent.
   - Emotional indicators include distress about having these thoughts (e.g., ""i wish i wasn't like this""), but no hopelessness or burden statements directly tied to a desire to die.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or imminent action (e.g., time-specific plans like ""tonight"").
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - However, the writer negates any desire to act: ""I really don't want to have to do that"" and expresses distress about the thoughts themselves. This aligns with unwanted suicidal thoughts, not a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method (eye drops) is mentioned, but it is described passively as an ""idea"" that arose from media consumption, not as part of a personal plan or preparation. The writer does not indicate intent to use this method or take steps toward it.
   - Given the lack of explicit planning and the context of resistance, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current thoughts and feelings; there is no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to trying a method). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The core of the post is distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""i wish i wasn't like this"") without a clear, personal desire to die. The mention of a method is abstract and triggered externally, not indicative of planning.
   - This fits 'Indicator' per the definition: ""expresses general distress... or discusses suicide abstractly,"" with suicidal thoughts explicitly stated as unwanted. The ambiguity around the method idea leans toward 'Indicator' when desire is negated.
   - It does not qualify as 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die; 'Behavior' is not met due to lack of plan/preparation; and 'Attempt' is absent as no action occurred.

Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions writing a suicide note a month ago, planning (""picked a time and place""), and preparation (""note primed and ready to be posted""). 
   - Expresses desire to die (""free myself of my problems"") and current temptation to re-engage with suicidal planning (""coax the feeling back,"" ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"").
   - No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), but details concrete preparations (note, timing, social/media setup). 
   - Describes self-sabotage of past plan (no initiated lethal action). 
   - Current language implies ongoing desire (""this time"") but no new plan/method beyond past preparations.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes (""suicide note,"" ""free myself of my problems,"" ""do it this time""). Desire is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. Specific preparations: suicide note written/ready, time/place chosen, social/media contingency planned. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Past: Planned/prepared but sabotaged action (no initiated lethal act). 
   - Present/Future: Desire to re-experience planning calm and potential renewed intent (""this time""), but no description of new or imminent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire + concrete past preparations (note, timeline) = **Behavior**.
   - Past self-sabotage confirms no lethal action was initiated (ruling out Attempt). 
   - Current language references past planning/prep without detailing new methods/immediacy, keeping focus on prior Behavior. 
   - ""Maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"" suggests ideation but lacks new plan details; the documented prep (note, time/place) anchors the classification.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay.

As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""i dont feel it will ever end""), despair (""feel like utter hell""), worthlessness (""stain upon the world""), isolation (""so alone and forgotten""), and physical/emotional pain. 
   - Mentions passive thoughts about absence/insignificance (""world would not change at all if I were gone,"" ""fading memory"") but **no explicit references to suicide, death, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions** related to suicide. 
   - Explicitly states a reason to live (""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No** direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die. Phrases about being ""gone"" or a ""fading memory"" reflect hopelessness and perceived insignificance, not active suicidal intent. The author affirms a commitment to ""stay"" and seek meaning.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No** mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm/suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - **No** description of past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or preparatory behaviors. Focus is on enduring emotional pain and trauma history.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post reveals severe psychological distress (depression, anxiety, PTSD) and passive hopelessness but lacks:
     - Explicit desire to die or commit suicide.
     - Any suicidal plan, method, or preparation.
     - References to past/recent suicidal actions.
   - The closest phrasing (""world would not change if I were gone"") denotes worthlessness, not suicidal intent, especially when contrasted with the stated reason to ""stay."" This aligns with **Indicator**, defined as expressing distress without explicit personal suicidal desire.

   - Specific methods are detailed: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself from a tree"".  
   - A timeframe is provided (""Tuesday""), indicating imminence.

Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""Having a lot of suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""death is just like sleep which seems amazing,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Why do I struggle... if it won't lead to anything?""), anhedonia (""laughing with my friends is nice but only lasts for a while,"" ""feel empty""), guilt/perceived burden (""suicide is selfish,"" concerns about impact on family/dog/friends).  
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - No past actions initiated (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Desire to die is explicit but conflicted due to external obligations (e.g., dog, friends, parents).

   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""it would be better if I was dead,"" and positive framing of death (""Sign me up please"").  
   - **Yes**: Desire to die is clearly expressed, though tempered by guilt. The writer does **not** state these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or concrete steps (e.g., pills, bridges, notes). Barriers are moral/relational (selfishness), not logistical.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past/current suicidal actions described (robbery incident was external danger, not self-initiated). Thoughts are ongoing but abstract.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""better if I was dead"") and endorsement of suicidal thoughts place this beyond general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Strong suicidal desire is present, but **no plan/method/preparation** is indicated (e.g., no ""I will use X method"").  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent lethal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal thoughts (""didn't have a method or anything"") and negative outcome (psych ward).  
   - Current emotional state: Paranoia, distrust, and worry about location tracking.  
   - Explicitly states past experience made them ""10x more suicidal"" but frames this as a reaction to trauma.  
   - **No explicit current desire to die, commit suicide, or end life**.  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or imminent timeline mentioned**.  
   - Focus is on seeking anonymous support to *prevent* crisis escalation, not expressing active intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself.""  
   - ""More suicidal"" references a past emotional reaction, not a current desire.  
   - Suicidal feelings are framed as unwanted consequences of past intervention.  
   → **No current personal desire to die expressed; leans toward 'Indicator'.**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. Past reference lacks method (""didn't have a method"").  
   - Current focus is on avoiding systems, not planning self-harm.  
   → **No evidence of plan/preparation.**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past event: Involuntary hospitalization after calling hotline.  
   - **No description of past self-initiated lethal action** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  
   - **No current/future action implied**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Primary content: Distress about past trauma and fear of systems.  
   - ""More suicidal"" is contextualized as a reaction, not active ideation.  
   - No current desire, plan, or behavior. Ambiguity about suicidal feelings is resolved by explicit framing as trauma response.  
   → **Fits 'Indicator'**: Distress about suicidal thoughts as unwanted consequences, no personal expression of current desire to die.

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes phrases like ""I dont want to live anymore,"" which indicates a personal desire to not be alive. It expresses emotional distress through ""This is not right"" and a sense of isolation with ""I just want be by myself,"" suggesting hopelessness.
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means (e.g., no reference to tools, locations, or substances). No preparations (e.g., writing a note) or past actions (e.g., previous attempts) are described.
   - The temporal context is present-focused with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire expressed is for the current state, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""I dont want to live anymore"" is an explicit personal expression of a desire to not be alive, aligning with the definition of suicidal ideation. It does not explicitly mention ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it clearly conveys a wish to cease living. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to act on them (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied. The content focuses solely on the desire to not live, without any actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current feeling or state, with no reference to past or recent actions. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal behavior (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The expression ""I dont want to live anymore"" constitutes an explicit, personal desire to not be alive, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation' (desire without a plan or method). There is no ambiguity about the suicidal desire being personal and current, and no elements push it toward 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no action). Since the desire is clear and not negated, it does not fit 'Indicator' (which requires lack of explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).

220,'If you are actually suicidal and not been attention seeking you would've told no one and just ended it silently so nobody could stop you' FUCK OFF. I FUCKING HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS LIKE ARE U JUST PLAIN STUPID. MAYBE BECAUSE IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON TO WHATEVER THE HELL I HAVE LEFT. MAYBE BECAUSE I STILL NEED HELP. AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger and frustration about being dismissed as ""attention-seeking"" when expressing feelings.  
   - Key phrases: ""I'm trying to fucking hold on,"" ""I still need help,"" ""I DID [ask for help] AND U NEGLECTED IT.""  
   - **No explicit mentions** of personal suicidal thoughts, death, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""whatever the hell I have left""), despair (rage at invalidation), and feeling neglected.  
   - Focus: Rebutting a harmful stereotype about suicide and pleading for validation/support, not expressing personal suicidal desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The author references suicide indirectly *only* to criticize others' attitudes (""If you are actually suicidal..."").  
   - They explicitly state efforts to ""hold on"" and ""need help,"" indicating a desire to survive, not die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. No tools, locations, timelines, or preparatory actions are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Discusses **past neglect** when seeking help (""I DID ASK FOR HELP""), but **no description** of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried X"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress about invalidation and a plea for support.  
   - While the post engages with suicide as a topic, the author **lacks personal desire to die** (emphasizing holding on/needing help).  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses hopelessness and distress but lacks explicit personal suicidal ideation, plans, or behaviors.

I have no more strenght, i feel like killing my self every day and it huts so much. Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done, ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer but shit, nothing here for me. over and over again only to be dissapointed. Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I feel like killing my self every day"" and ""this might be my final good bye,"" indicating explicit suicidal thoughts and a potential farewell.
   - Emotional indicators include loneliness, exhaustion (""no more strenght""), hopelessness (""nothing here for me""), and repeated disappointment.
   - Specific preparations are stated: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done,"" showing concrete steps taken in anticipation of suicide.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, and there is no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). The reference to ""ive wrote here before"" likely means previous posts seeking help, not a suicide attempt.
   - Imminence is implied with ""this might be my final good bye,"" but no specific timeframe is given.
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing my self"" and implies a desire to die through phrases like ""final good bye"" and ""nothing here for me.""
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no expression of not wanting to act on the thoughts), so this is not an 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method or plan (e.g., tools, location) is mentioned, but preparations are explicitly described: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done.""
   - This fulfills the 'Behavior' criteria, as preparations like writing a suicide note are highlighted in the definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal ideation (""I feel like killing my self every day"") and future intention (""this might be my final good bye"").
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of taking pills or self-harming). The line ""ive wrote here before and gave it a chance"" refers to seeking help or waiting for life to improve, not a suicide attempt. Thus, it does not meet the 'Attempt' threshold.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.
   - Preparations (suicide note, etc.) are present, moving this beyond 'Ideation' (which requires no plan or preparation).
   - Since no specific method is mentioned, but preparations are explicitly stated, 'Behavior' is appropriate. The definition includes preparations like writing a suicide note.
   - No initiated lethal action is described, so it is not an 'Attempt'.

I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting.

I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""kms"" (kill myself) is used multiple times.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can't keep it to myself anymore""), isolation (""I can't talk to anyone""), and guilt/embarrassment about seeking help.  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"" and ""I'm about to kms.""  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or timelines beyond ""very soon"").  
   - Self-harm is mentioned (""I can't stop cutting""), but this is distinct from a suicidal act.  
   - A barrier to immediate action is noted (""I can't leave my dog""), indicating intent is future-oriented but not imminent.  
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose yesterday"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""kms,"" and ""I’m going to kill myself very soon"" confirm a personal desire to die. The thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing intrusions (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal intent is clear, there is no mention of a specific method (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""gun""), plan (""tonight,"" ""at the bridge""), or preparations (e.g., ""bought pills,"" ""wrote a note"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post focuses on **future intent** (""soon,"" ""not yet"").  
   - **No evidence of past/current initiated suicidal actions**. Self-harm (""cutting"") is noted but is non-lethal and distinct from a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I’m going to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation is described → **Ideation**.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal actions → not 'Attempt'.  
   - Self-harm (""cutting"") is a risk factor but does not elevate the category to 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' without suicidal intent tied to a plan/action.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people. And there's many other stuff. They deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death on their shoulders, I hope they spend the rest of their days wondering if it was their fault.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""shoot myself on the spot."" It expresses strong emotional indicators like hopelessness, anger (e.g., ""they deserve to live the rest of their life with the burden of my death""), and a sense of being a burden. Specific methods are mentioned (""shoot myself""), and there is evidence of preparation (""one of my suicide notes I threw away""). The desire to die is personal and current, with increased intent due to the family intervention. No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the suicide note is a preparation, not an initiated attempt. Imminence is implied with ""on the spot"" but not concretely timed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""shoot myself,"" expressing a clear, personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the writer reinforces the desire (e.g., ""I don't care"" about the family's suffering). Thus, it is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method (""shoot myself"") is mentioned, and preparations are evident (""suicide notes""). This satisfies the criteria for 'Behavior', as it goes beyond mere ideation by including concrete elements of planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions and past preparations (writing the note), but no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of trying to shoot or harm themselves). The ""wish"" to shoot on the spot is hypothetical, not an action taken. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire (ruling out 'Indicator') and includes a method and preparation (ruling out 'Ideation'). Since there is no evidence of an initiated action, it cannot be 'Attempt'. The presence of a specific method (""shoot myself"") and preparations (suicide notes) aligns with 'Behavior'. Per the rules, if a plan/method is present, it is 'Behavior'.

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""OD"" (overdose) as a method of suicide, specifically listing medications (venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolfresh, inderal) and expressing intent to take them all at once. 
   - Emotional indicators include numbness (""I can't feel anything right now""), hopelessness, and persistent suicidal thoughts (""it's all I can think about,"" ""I've been thinking about suicide for a while"").
   - There is a specific plan/method: overdosing on named prescription drugs, with means available (""I have a month's prescription"").
   - Preparations are implied by having the drugs, but no explicit actions like writing a note are mentioned.
   - Imminence is indicated with ""today.""
   - The desire to die is present (""hope for the best"" implies a wish for death despite uncertainty about lethality), with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated.
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described; references are to thoughts (""thinking about suicide"") and mood fluctuations, not initiated acts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""OD"" (a direct reference to self-harm).
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""think I'm going to OD today,"" ""hope for the best"" in context of ending life).
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; instead, the tone suggests consideration and intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (overdosing) and tools (listed medications) are mentioned.
   - Yes, means are available (possession of prescriptions), indicating preparation.
   - This elevates the risk beyond ideation to behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intention (""today"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""think I'm going to"" and ""feel like popping"" denote planning, not action taken.
   - Past references are to thoughts (""thinking about suicide"") and mood, not concrete actions, so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) combined with a specific method and means (overdosing with available drugs), meeting the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a plan/method is clearly present (method and means specified).
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described; the post discusses intent and preparation for a future act.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses deep hopelessness (""I've got nothing left,"" ""I'm completely used up"") and feelings of being a burden (""I'm sorry I wasn't a better person""). It includes a direct reference to ending life (""The end is the only thing that feels right now"") and farewell messages (""Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt,"" ""thank you,"" ""Love you Mom, Dad..."").
   - There is no explicit mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The apologies and thanks could imply goodbye but are not explicit preparations.
   - The temporal context is present-focused (""feels right now""), indicating current intent, but no description of past actions or attempts.
   - The writer expresses a desire for ""the end,"" which implies a wish to die, without stating it as unwanted or negating the thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies a personal desire to die in a context of despair, without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted. Thus, it meets the threshold for explicit suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The farewells are emotional expressions, not explicit preparations (e.g., ""writing a suicide note"" is absent). Since there is no clear plan/method, this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt like ""I tried to...""). It focuses on present emotional state, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a clear personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) but lacks any plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. There is no described past or recent action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The emotional distress and implied desire align with 'Ideation' because the writer expresses a wish for death without actionable details. While farewells could hint at risk, they are not sufficient for 'Behavior' without explicit planning elements. The rules specify to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about plan/method, and 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the explicit desire for ""the end.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling ""terrible,"" ""suicidal,"" ""depressed,"" and ""overwhelmed.""  
   - Explicitly states: ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat"" – indicating a **specific method (cutting throat)** and a **desire to act**.  
   - No references to past actions, preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), or temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""don't know what to do""), anhedonia (""can't even cry"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions being ""suicidal"" and expresses a desire to end thoughts via self-harm (""cutting my god damn throat""). No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (""cutting my god damn throat"") is mentioned in the context of acting on suicidal urges.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current** urges/desires (""all I want to do"") but **no initiated action** (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""did"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Explicit desire to die + specific method (""cutting throat"") → **Behavior** (per rules: mention of a method qualifies as Behavior).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated action.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire is explicit and personal; not abstract/unwanted thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post references a quote about suicide: ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doesn't matter,"" described as more beautifully phrased. The user is sharing this quote and asking if anyone knows more about it.
   - There are no emotional indicators of hopelessness, despair, or personal burden from the author. The quote itself has a philosophical tone, suggesting resilience rather than promoting suicide.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide are mentioned by the author. The focus is solely on the external quote.
   - There is no imminence of intention (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") from the author.
   - The writer does not express a personal desire to die; instead, they are discussing the quote abstractly and seeking information.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The quote contains the phrase ""kill yourself,"" but this is not the author's personal expression; it is part of a referenced quote. The author does not explicitly state ""I want to die"" or similar for themselves.
   - The author does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive. Instead, they present the quote as an interesting or insightful thought, even describing it as ""beautifully phrased,"" which implies a focus on the idea rather than personal distress.
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned in the quote but are framed as conditional and external. There is no indication that the author endorses or experiences these thoughts personally. Therefore, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned by the author. The post is purely about sharing and inquiring about a quote, with no planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes stumbling upon a quote recently, but this is not a suicidal action. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) by the author are described. The quote refers to a general concept, not an event involving the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly through a quote but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from the author. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes abstract mentions of suicide without current personal intent.
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit personal desire to die expressed by the author. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not applicable due to the absence of any plan, method, preparation, or initiated action.
   - Given the ambiguity rule (choose 'Indicator' if unsure between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'), 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to ""leave earth"" and mentions repeatedly ""wanting to die,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i'm not happy anymore,"" ""my life will never get better""), despair (""i give up on everything,"" ""i can't do this anymore""), and references to chronic unhappiness. The phrase ""ready to join my dog"" implies a wish for death to reunite with a deceased pet, reinforcing suicidal intent. However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The temporal context is general and recurring (""i always end up wanting to die"") with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") or description of past or recent initiated actions. The writer's desire to die is explicit and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through phrases like ""i want to leave earth,"" ""i always end up wanting to die,"" and ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" in a context of despair. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to act on this""). This rules out 'Indicator' and confirms suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye concretely) are mentioned. ""Ready to join my dog"" is metaphorical and vague, not indicating a plan. Without any explicit planning element, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes ongoing feelings and a current state of being ""ready"" but no past or recent initiated actions. References to ""always end up wanting to die"" are about recurring thoughts, not concrete actions. There is no description of a potentially lethal act that was started (e.g., ""I tried to...""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows a clear, personal desire to die (suicidal intent) without any plan, method, or preparation, aligning with 'Ideation'. The lack of specific actionable steps means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. The emotional distress is tied to explicit suicidal thoughts, not just general unhappiness, so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. No past or recent actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions past suicidal intent: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit.""  
   - Emotional context includes hopelessness (past decision to die) but also current protective factors (mother's grief, newfound appreciation for life).  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., pills, rope, note-writing).  
   - The writer states they **no longer intend** to act (""Now, I know I can't do that"").

   - **Yes**, explicit phrases like ""kill myself"" are used.  
   - **However**, the desire is framed in the past tense and explicitly negated in the present (""I know I can't do that"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - A timeframe (""before Christmas"") is mentioned, but **no specific method, tools, or preparations** are described.  
   - Timeframes alone are insufficient for 'Behavior'; a concrete plan/method is required.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **past intention** (""I was going to..."").  
   - **No initiated action** (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm attempt). The writer only references a decision, not an act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit past desire to die qualifies as suicidal **ideation**.  
   - Lack of method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - While the writer expresses distress, the explicit past suicidal thoughts (even if now rejected) align with 'Ideation'.  
   - Protective factors (mother's grief, new perspective) contextualize the ideation but don't change the classification.

230,"Am I faking my depression?. Ok so for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide for days. My home life isnt that good. Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" and ""triggers me to actually want to commit suicide.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (family conflicts, feeling unappreciated), despair (suicidal ideation as a response to triggers).  
   - References to suicide methods (""ways to kill myself"") but **no specific plan, tools, location, or preparation** described (e.g., no pills/rope acquired, no note written).  
   - Describes recurring thoughts (""could have these thoughts for days"") but **no past/current initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""tried to overdose"").  
   - Temporal context: Thoughts occur during fights (""when we fight I always think about suicide""), but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""want to commit suicide"" but questions motivation (""feel like I’m doing it for attention"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""thoughts about suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""want to commit suicide"" show personal desire. Self-doubt (""faking"") doesn’t negate the expressed intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Mentions researching methods but **no specific method, plan, or preparation** (e.g., ""easy painless ways"" is generic; no substance/tool/location specified). Research alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' without actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried""). Only references **thoughts and research**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""want to commit suicide"") → Rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - No specific plan/method/preparation → Rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No initiated lethal action → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Core content: Recurring suicidal thoughts + explicit desire, but no actionable plan → **Ideation**.

231,Life is useless. I bet you that there's something better on the other side not like heaven but a life you live without thought or human Emotions no hunger no body or mind. Just a being. Death and suicide need to be normalized,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and a philosophical view of death as potentially better (""something better on the other side... no thought or human Emotions""). It mentions ""Death and suicide"" in the context of normalization, but not as a personal desire or plan. There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. No references to past actions or attempts. No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer's stated desire focuses on abstract concepts, not a personal wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is mentioned (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""), but it is discussed abstractly and socially, not as a personal expression (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). The phrase ""Life is useless"" indicates despair but not an explicit, current desire for self-inflicted death. The writer does not state or imply that they are experiencing unwanted suicidal thoughts; instead, the tone is more advocative. Therefore, explicit personal suicidal intent is absent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned. The content remains vague and general.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes beliefs about death and suicide, not past or recent actions. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows distress and hopelessness but lacks a clear, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. Mentions of suicide are abstract and normalized, not self-referential. This aligns with 'Indicator' (general distress without personal suicidal desire). Ambiguity exists due to phrases like ""Life is useless,"" but the absence of explicit personal intent means 'Indicator' is appropriate. No plan/method indicates it's not 'Behavior,' and no past actions rule out 'Attempt'.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses the concept of death in an abstract, philosophical manner, describing it as ""beautiful"" and focusing on the relief from pain (""never feel pain anymore""), avoidance of life's difficulties (""never deal with the hassle""), and a sense of release (""to let go after holding on so tight""). It uses poetic language like ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity.""
   - There are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping). No preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) or references to past actions are present.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (e.g., escaping pain and hassle), but these are framed as general reflections rather than personal declarations.
   - The imminence of any intention is absent; the post centers on the ""thought"" of death, not a timeline for action.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous—they romanticize death but do not explicitly express a personal wish to die or act on suicidal thoughts. The tone is rhetorical and detached (e.g., ""Ain't the thought..."" and ""Isn't it just beautiful?"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used. The word ""death"" is mentioned, but in a conceptual, impersonal context.
   - The post does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). Instead, it ponders the appeal of death as an idea, which leans toward abstract distress.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and any implied desire is negated by the lack of personal ownership, this points to 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparation (e.g., notes, goodbyes) is indicated. The content remains hypothetical and general.
   - Without any plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post reflects on the idea of death in a timeless, non-specific manner. It does not describe past, current, or future actions (e.g., no references to attempts or initiated behaviors).
   - There is no evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action by the author, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness through an abstract discussion of death's appeal, but it lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent from the author. The rhetorical questioning and impersonal framing suggest the writer is contemplating death as a concept, not stating a personal wish to die.
   - This fits 'Indicator', which covers vague or philosophical mentions of death/suicide without explicit personal desire. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent should default to 'Indicator' per the rules.
   - It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires described actions).

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions intense emotional distress (feeling like an outcast, friends not caring, family conflict, exhaustion, hopelessness, and a crumbling will to live). It explicitly references suicide multiple times: ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself,"" ""committing suicide,"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day."" There is a conditional plan based on COVID test results: running away if negative (with ambiguous risk) and suicide if positive. The method is vague (""any method""), with no specific tools, locations, or substances described. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The timeline is imminent (""tomorrow"" for results), but all actions are future-oriented. The author expresses a clear, current desire to die if COVID-positive, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""committing suicide."" It expresses a genuine desire to die in the COVID-positive scenario (e.g., ""i don't see another day,"" ""not afraid of death anymore""). There is no statement negating or rejecting these thoughts (e.g., the author acknowledges the thoughts as ""selfish and irrational"" but still intends to act on them). This indicates explicit suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A conditional plan is mentioned (suicide if COVID-positive), but the method is non-specific (""use any method""). No details about tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., ""got pills"" or ""wrote a note"") are provided. The vagueness (""any method"") does not constitute an explicit plan or method as defined for 'Behavior'. Since there is uncertainty about specificity, this leans toward 'Ideation' per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""i'll decide what to do once i get them,"" ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself""). There are no references to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., a prior suicide attempt). Mentions of past fear of death relate to thoughts, not actions. All suicidal content is prospective, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts confirm 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire to die). The lack of a specific method, plan details, or preparations rules out 'Behavior' (e.g., ""any method"" is too vague; no evidence of planning steps). With no past actions described, 'Attempt' does not apply. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post expresses a personal desire to die with conditional intent but no concrete plan or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"" (direct suicidal intent).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""burden"", ""disappointment"", hopelessness (""nothing"" after overdose, ""nobody else"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (actual ingestion of pills).  
   - Past action: Describes a concrete, potentially lethal act (overdose) initiated by the author that failed (""nothing"").  
   - Imminence: References a recent/completed action (""took... and nothing"") and expresses ongoing intent (""what should i do kill mslef"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""kill myself"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself"" repeated).  
   - Yes (clear desire to die, frustration at failed attempt).  
   - No negation of desire (distress is about failure, not unwanted thoughts).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method specified: Overdose (""zopiclone"").  
   - Preparation confirmed: ""took an entire bottle"" (action completed).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent concrete action**: Ingestion of pills (""took... and nothing"").  
   - Action was potentially lethal (whole bottle of sleep medication) and self-initiated.  
   - Current pleas (""what should i do"") indicate ongoing crisis but don’t override the past lethal act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The overdose (""took..."") is a clear, initiated, potentially lethal act meeting the 'Attempt' definition.  
   - Despite the failure (""nothing""), the action was concrete. Rules state 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior when a past lethal action is described.  
   - Distinction from 'Behavior': Actual ingestion occurred, not just planning.  
   - Distinction from 'Ideation': Method was not just mentioned—it was used.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post describes intense emotional distress (feeling ""like Hell,"" anger, not belonging in society) and personal struggles (being ""short, skinny aspie,"" having learning disabilities, mistreatment by others).
   - Explicit suicidal intent: The phrase ""I might kill myself"" directly references suicide.
   - No specific method, plan, timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.
   - No past actions (e.g., prior attempts) are described.
   - The phrase ""I might kill myself"" expresses a potential desire to die but lacks certainty or immediacy.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states ""I might kill myself,"" indicating a personal expression of suicidal thoughts. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I won't"") to suggest these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No method/preparation**: While suicidal intent is present, no specific plan, tools, location, or preparatory steps are mentioned. The phrasing is vague and conditional (""might"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The statement ""I might kill myself"" refers to a future possibility, not a past or recent action. No initiated suicidal act is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (""I might kill myself""), moving it beyond **Indicator** (which requires no explicit suicidal desire).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No past or recent suicidal action is mentioned, so **Attempt** does not apply.
   - This fits **Ideation**: Explicit suicidal thoughts/desire are present, but without a specific plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""end it"") and a specific method (""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""struggling with depression for god knows how long"") and a clear desire to cease existing (""I will be non existent"").  
   - A specific plan is detailed: method (overdosing on Tylenol and Advil), means (whole bottles), and imminent timing (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes"").  
   - There is no mention of past actions or preparations beyond the stated future plan.  
   - The writer expresses a definitive desire to die (""Goodbye world,"" ""I will be non existent"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""end it"" and ""I will be non existent"" directly indicate a desire to die.  
   - No negation or expression of unwanted thoughts; the tone is declarative.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific methods (Tylenol, Advil overdose), quantities (""whole bottle[s]""), and timing (""tonight,"" ""minutes"") are provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""going to end it tonight"") with immediate timing (""minutes"").  
   - No past or recent initiated action is described (e.g., no mention of having taken pills yet).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Ideation**: Ruled out because a specific plan/method is present.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits perfectly—explicit desire to die **with** a detailed plan (method, means, timing).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""i want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct personal desire for suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""physically uncomfortable,"" ""miserable"") and frustration about memory gaps.  
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, location), or preparations (e.g., note-writing).  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  
   - The desire to die is stated as a current feeling without negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""i want to kill myself"" is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent. The author does not frame this as an unwanted thought.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current distress and desire but **no past or recent initiated suicidal actions**. References to last year focus on emotional misery, not concrete suicidal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past/current lethal action rules out *Attempt*.

And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" and ""die."" It references a past ""failed attempt in October,"" indicating a concrete suicidal action. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""life wants me to kill myself,"" ""everything is shit,"" ""I deserve to die"") and feelings of being undeserving. A specific future plan is stated: ""I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks,"" but no method or preparation details (e.g., tools, substances) are provided. The desire to die is clear and affirmed, with no indication of the thoughts being unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""end myself,"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I deserve to die,"" ""I will end myself""). There is no statement suggesting these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific temporal plan is mentioned (""on my birthday in two weeks""), but no method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are detailed. The reference to a past attempt does not include current preparations. Due to the lack of explicit method or preparation, this leans toward 'Ideation' if considered alone, but the past attempt takes precedence.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past concrete suicidal action: ""my first failed attempt in October,"" which was initiated and potentially lethal (even though it failed). It also expresses future intent (""I will end myself... in two weeks""). The past attempt is a key factor, as it was a self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond general distress or unwanted thoughts (which would be 'Indicator') due to explicit suicidal desire. It includes a future plan with timing but no method, which could suggest 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'; however, the rules state that if unsure about plan/method explicitness, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'. Crucially, the description of a past ""failed attempt"" is concrete and potentially lethal, falling under 'Attempt'. The rules specify that if a past attempt is mentioned, 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior, as the action was initiated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""my last suicide attempt,"" confirming a past concrete suicidal action by the author. 
   - Current emotional state is positive (""I feel really good,"" ""suicidal thoughts kinda left... they are gone""), with no expressions of hopelessness or despair. 
   - Mentions thinking about death but explicitly states ""not about doing it,"" indicating no current intent or plan. 
   - No mention of current methods, preparations, or imminent plans. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, but only regarding a past event (""last suicide attempt""). Current thoughts are explicitly negated (""they are gone,"" ""not about doing it""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No current plan/method/preparation** mentioned. Past attempt is referenced, but no details imply ongoing planning. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a **past potentially lethal action** (""last suicide attempt"") initiated by the author. 
   - No current behavior or imminent intent is expressed. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is the **description of a past suicide attempt** (""I took pills last night"" would be analogous). This meets the 'Attempt' definition. 
   - Despite current positive recovery, the rules prioritize concrete past actions: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'."" 
   - Current mentions of death are explicitly non-actionable, aligning with recovery, not 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense distress: ""can't take it anymore,"" ""frustrating to hold my tears,"" ""eyes burning,"" ""can't sleep,"" ""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy,"" ""guilty,"" ""so tired.""  
   - References ""awful thoughts"" causing fear but explicitly states: ""I don’t have a plan to hurt myself.""  
   - No references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""can't take it anymore""), anhedonia (""can't bring myself to do what I enjoy""), guilt, exhaustion.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or desire to die.  
   - ""Awful thoughts"" could imply suicidal ideation but is vague. Critically, the author states these thoughts are *unwanted* (""I'm so scared"") and explicitly negates intent/plan (""I don’t have a plan to hurt myself"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Focus is on current emotional suffering.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress (hopelessness, guilt, exhaustion) and intrusive thoughts but **explicitly disavows a plan or desire to act**.  
   - The fear around ""awful thoughts"" frames them as *unwanted*, aligning with distress about the thoughts themselves rather than a current desire to die.

This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing. I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time and it's just so so much all the time. I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual! Hopefully the roof collapses or my matress turns into a large mouth and eats me or some stupid shit I don't even know why I typed this out",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, self-loathing, and anhedonia (e.g., ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I don't wanna play video games... or even eat anymore""). 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present: ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time."" 
   - No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no references to tools, locations, or notes). 
   - Self-harm thoughts are described (""imagine myself amputating parts of my body"") but explicitly stated as never acted upon: ""I've never purposely hurt myself."" 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; hospitalization is mentioned but framed as historical depression treatment. 
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted (e.g., ""I want to die"" is unqualified; the only restraint cited is guilt about parents' sadness).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, direct phrases include ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day.""  
   - **No** indication these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the author consistently endorses the desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.  
   - Self-harm imagery is hypothetical/fantasy-based and explicitly not acted upon.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes persistent suicidal thoughts (""every day"") but **no** concrete past/recent actions.  
   - Hospitalization is noted but linked to past depression, not a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core elements are **explicit desire to die** and **persistent suicidal thoughts**, meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'.  
   - Absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No described initiated actions rule out 'Attempt'.  
   - Emotional distress alone would lean toward 'Indicator', but the explicit, personal desire to die elevates it to 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions emotional pain causing physical symptoms (""hurting,"" ""muscles ache,"" ""exhausting,"" ""body giving up"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight.""  
   - No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans (e.g., acquiring means), or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context: Desire is future-oriented (""tonight"") but passive (hoping for death during sleep, not self-initiated action).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The writer explicitly expresses a desire to die (""hoping i will die"").  
   - No negation of this desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: The wish for death is passive (hoping to die *in sleep*). No method (e.g., overdose), tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future wish (""tonight"") but no description of past/current self-initiated lethal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""hoping i will die"") and temporal framing (""tonight"") indicate **active suicidal ideation**.  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current self-initiated actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Not **Indicator** because the writer personally expresses a current desire to die (passively wishing for death still qualifies as ideation).  
   - Classification: **Ideation** (desire to die, no plan/method).

243,"Zoloft overdose. So at 11:30 I took 6 pills the equivalent to 300mg and It obviously wasn't enough to kill me, I feel completely fine now apart from slight nausea and I'm really sweaty, will I be okay if I don't go to hospital?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions a ""Zoloft overdose"" and describes taking 6 pills (300mg) at a specific time (11:30), indicating a concrete action.  
   - It references death/suicide through phrases like ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" showing a personal desire for the act to be lethal.  
   - Emotional indicators are implied by the act (e.g., hopelessness), but not explicitly stated.  
   - Specific method (Zoloft pills) and preparation/action (taking the pills) are clearly described.  
   - The action is past-tense (""I took""), initiated, and potentially lethal, with reported effects (nausea, sweating).  
   - The question about not going to the hospital indicates current concern but does not negate the past suicidal action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""overdose"" and ""kill me,"" indicating a clear desire to die.  
   - There is no statement that the thoughts or actions are unwanted; instead, the failure to die is noted with disappointment.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - A specific method is mentioned (Zoloft overdose with 300mg pills), and the action of taking the pills constitutes preparation and execution.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""I took 6 pills"") that was completed but failed to cause death.  
   - This is a concrete suicidal act, not just thoughts or planning.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The key distinction is between 'Behavior' (plan/preparation without action) and 'Attempt' (initiated lethal action).  
   - Here, the author describes a specific, past action that was potentially lethal (overdose), even though it failed. This fits the 'Attempt' category.  
   - The presence of a method and action rules out 'Indicator' (no personal desire) and 'Ideation' (no plan/action).  
   - 'Attempt' takes precedence over current concerns because the post focuses on a described past action.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes phrases indicating a decision to end life: ""destined to do it,"" ""made my decision,"" ""at peace knowing it's soon,"" and ""hope my plan works.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""body that has clearly given up"") and calm resolve (""feel so calm"").  
   - A ""plan"" is explicitly mentioned, though no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note, means) is detailed.  
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""soon""), with no description of past or recent actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Destined to do it"" (strongly implying suicide) and ""no way I'm living"" express a clear personal desire to die. The calm acceptance (""at peace"") confirms genuine intent, not distress about unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. The author explicitly references a ""plan"" (""Hope my plan works"") and temporal imminence (""soon""). Though no method/preparation specifics are given, the explicit mention of a plan qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""soon"") with no indication of initiated actions. Phrases like ""destined to do it"" and ""hope my plan works"" are anticipatory, not retrospective.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (Ideation) is present, but the **mention of a plan** (""plan works"") elevates it to Behavior.  
   - No method/preparation details create ambiguity, but the explicit plan reference aligns with Behavior.  
   - No past/current actions (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took pills"") are described, ruling out Attempt.  
   - The calm resolve and personal ownership (""my plan"") distinguish this from Indicator.

I just want to find an actual suicide forum.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions strong emotional indicators: ""Hopeless"" (repeated), despair (""realizing you're hopeless is too much""), and anhedonia (""I don't want encouragement"").  
   - Explicitly references suicide via the phrase: ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""suicide forum"" directly links the author's desire to engage with suicide-related content. The context (hopelessness, rejecting help) implies this reflects personal suicidal thoughts, not abstract discussion.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a method, tool, location, or preparation. Seeking a forum indicates ideation but not concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing hopelessness and a current desire to find a suicide forum. **No** past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a desire to engage with suicide content, implying personal suicidal thoughts.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Strong suicidal intent (via forum reference) distinguishes this from general distress ('Indicator').  
   - Fits **'Ideation'**: Explicit personal desire linked to suicide (forum search), with no plan or action.

Idc if no one responds I'm just on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die even though I know it's painful idc just want an end",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""slash my wrists and die,"" which is a direct reference to suicide and a specific method (slashing wrists).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""how low my expectations have""), despair (""I just wanted my mother to tell me it'll be okay. Why couldn't I get even that?""), and feelings of worthlessness (""I'm disgusting to look at"").
   - A specific method is identified (""slash my wrists""), and there is a sense of imminence (""on the verge of trying"").
   - The writer expresses a clear desire for death (""idc just want an end""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.
   - There is no mention of past suicidal actions (e.g., the phrase ""I tried, I guess"" appears to refer to seeking emotional support or considering sex work, not a suicide attempt). The focus is on a current/future intention (""on the verge of trying"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related actions (""slash my wrists and die"").
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""just want an end"").
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they emphasize a willingness to act despite pain (""idc just want an end"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""slash my wrists"").
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools or writing a note) are described, but the method is clearly stated.
   - Since a method is explicitly identified, this leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""on the verge of trying"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal action. The phrase ""I tried, I guess"" is ambiguous but contextually refers to non-suicidal actions (e.g., seeking comfort or considering sex work), not a concrete suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""just want an end"") and specific method (""slash my wrists"") rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire).
   - The presence of a specific method moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which is thoughts/desire without a plan/method).
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, with a stated desire and explicit method, the post fits 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""life will get better"" is ""bullshit"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone.""  
   - Mentions preparation: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it.""  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or location is mentioned.  
   - No reference to past actions or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I cannot wait to die"" directly expresses a personal desire to die to end pain.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs"" indicates concrete preparation (arranging post-death logistics).  
   - No method or plan details are given, but preparation alone qualifies for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent and preparation.  
   - **No** description of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""cannot wait to die"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - Preparation (""fix funeral costs"") elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plans/preparations).  
   - Absence of a past/recent initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - **Result**: Fits 'Behavior' due to suicidal desire + preparation (funeral arrangements).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""i'm destined to live a depressed life"") and anhedonia (inability to see future happiness). It references loss (""everything that made my happiness has now left me"") and existential questioning (""what's really the point?""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. 
   - The writer seeks wisdom and acknowledges potential self-indulgence, indicating distress but no action-oriented intent. 
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or past actions related to suicide are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die. The questioning of life's point reflects despair but not a stated wish for death. Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, wanted, or unwanted. Leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, gun), or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. The content is emotional and philosophical, not actionable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Focuses on past happiness and future dread, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions. No initiated behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. This fits 'Indicator' (general distress without suicidal intent). Ambiguity about life's point doesn't elevate to 'Ideation' due to absence of explicit suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""jump from a bridge"" as a method for suicide, with the intent of achieving death (""highest chance of death""). It includes emotional indicators of hopelessness (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") and a specific plan to act (""by the weekend""). The writer expresses a desire for the outcome to be fatal (""wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want""). There is no mention of past actions; the focus is on future intentions. The imminence is indicated by the timeline ""by the weekend."" The writer's stated desire is clearly to die, as they are seeking information to maximize lethality.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide through the phrase ""jump from a bridge"" in the context of seeking death. It expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""highest chance of death,"" ""wish me luck"" implying hope for a fatal outcome). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the writer is actively planning.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""jump from a bridge"") and researched (""which one do I have the highest chance of death""). Preparations include gathering information and setting a timeline (""pick one by the weekend""). This indicates concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""gonna pick one by the weekend"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions. It focuses on planning rather than an action that has been carried out, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit suicidal desire and intent. It exceeds 'Ideation' because a specific method and preparations (research, timeline) are present. It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent action was initiated. The presence of a plan/method aligns with 'Behavior'. The rule to choose 'Ideation' if unsure about plan/method does not apply here, as the method and preparations are explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of being misunderstood, mistreated, hopelessness (""I am here to live in pain,"" ""The pain will never loosen its grip""), and a sense of inescapable suffering (""I will never be free,"" ""This is my destiny""). There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include despair, perceived burden (""I am supposed to suffer""), and anhedonia-like statements, but no explicit suicidal desire or plans. The writer focuses on their pain and isolation, with phrases like ""I will never die"" suggesting a belief in perpetual suffering rather than a wish to die. No past actions, preparations, or imminent intentions related to suicide are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear expression of a desire to die; instead, statements like ""I will never die"" imply a fear of enduring pain, not a wish for death.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of unwanted thoughts or a negation of desire. The primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances, not suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation (e.g., note, goodbyes). The content is entirely focused on emotional suffering without actionable elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional states and beliefs (e.g., ""I am convinced,"" ""I am here to live in pain""), with no references to past or future actions. No initiated suicidal actions are described, even in passing.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and despair without any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. Phrases like ""I will never die"" reinforce a sense of entrapment in life rather than a wish to end it. There is ambiguity about suicidal intent, but the rules state to choose 'Indicator' when there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thoughts. 'Ideation' is not appropriate as there is no mention of wanting to die or not be alive. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are irrelevant due to the absence of plans, methods, or actions.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions sister's suicide and past attempts.

   - Explicitly references **their own past suicide attempt** (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"").  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation described. Current motivation to live is solely to spare parents.  
   - Emotional tone: Hopelessness, ambivalence about life, but no imminent intent.

   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - Current passive ideation (""welcome end,"" questioning life's purpose) does not override the clear description of a past attempt.

I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions emotional distress (hopelessness, despair, anhedonia) with phrases like ""There's no hope anymore,"" ""There's no joy anymore,"" and ""The pain is numb now."" It explicitly references a suicidal plan with ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess,"" indicating a method (likely drowning or self-harm in water to minimize mess). There is also a goodbye/apology (""I'm sorry to those who cared about me... Thank You""), which suggests preparation similar to a suicide note. No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on future intent. The author expresses a clear desire to die, framing it as necessary (""it's for the best"") without any indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""doing it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide in context, and the desire to die is explicit (e.g., ""I plan on doing it"" and ""it's for the best""). There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., no mention of not wanting to act). Thus, explicit intent is present, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""in the tub"") with rationale for less mess, implying a planned approach. The goodbye message serves as a form of preparation (e.g., akin to a suicide note). This combination of plan, method, and preparation aligns with 'Behavior', not 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions (""I plan on doing it"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to trying or failing an attempt). Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire, a specific plan/method (tub), and preparation (goodbye) categorizes this as 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' due to clear intent, not 'Ideation' due to the plan/method, and not 'Attempt' as no action was initiated.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress (""I just want the pain to go away"") and a plea for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include pain and possible despair, but no explicit hopelessness, anhedonia, or feeling like a burden. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are present. 
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated. 
   - The writer's desire is for relief from pain through comfort (a hug), not a stated wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive; the focus is on alleviating pain, not ending life. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication of them being unwanted or resisted. 
   - This strongly leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress without suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., note, means) is mentioned or implied. 
   - Without any suicidal desire established, this step is not applicable, but confirms no escalation beyond distress.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current emotional state, not a past event or future intention. 
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and a wish for pain relief but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. 
   - It fits 'Indicator' because it expresses distress without explicit suicidal thoughts or intent. 
   - Ambiguity exists in ""want the pain to go away"" potentially implying passive ideation, but it is not explicit; per rules, when in doubt between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator. 
   - Does not meet thresholds for Ideation (no desire to die), Behavior (no plan/method), or Attempt (no action).

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post begins with an explicit statement: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. Key elements include expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"") and extensive emotional distress (hopelessness, despair, trauma, feelings of failure, worthlessness, and abandonment). 
   - There are mentions of past actions, such as misusing painkillers, antidepressants, and paracetamol, leading to addiction and physical harm (e.g., liver damage, digestive issues, self-starvation). However, these are framed as coping mechanisms for ""racing thoughts"" and not as intentional suicide attempts. For example, the writer states they took substances ""to cope,"" not to die. 
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances for suicide, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is vague and lacks details on how or when. 
   - Temporal context: The suicidal thoughts are current (""I just feel like...""), but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified. Past events (e.g., medication misuse, trauma) are described as historical experiences, not initiated suicide attempts. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""wanting to end it"" and ""IM GOING TO END IT."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them; instead, the tone conveys genuine despair and a personal wish to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The references to medication misuse and self-starvation are contextualized as consequences of addiction and coping, not as elements of a suicide plan. Without any explicit details on means, tools, locations, or steps for suicide, this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions (e.g., medication misuse, self-starvation), but these are not presented as initiated suicide attempts. They are instead characterized as harmful coping strategies that led to unintended physical consequences. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action taken with suicidal intent (e.g., ""I tried to overdose to die""). Thus, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows a clear, personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. Past actions do not constitute an 'Attempt' as they were not initiated as suicidal acts. While there is significant distress, the explicit suicidal intent places this above 'Indicator'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back.

We both unfollowed each other on social media and deleted our conversations. He said he was crying. I felt like crying. I feel like cutting myself again. Fuck my parents. Fuck my life. Fuck everything.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""I really want to fucking kill myself.""  
   - Specific method/plan: ""I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" (Specifies location, method, and intent).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair (""Fuck my life""), anger (""Fuck my parents""), relapse of suicidal thoughts.  
   - References past self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again"") but no mention of past suicide attempts.  
   - No indication of preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) or imminent timing beyond the described plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and describes a lethal scenario (train crushing head). No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (laying head on train tracks), location (train station near house), and implied plan (""thinking about running away"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** (""I'm thinking about..."").  
   - No past or recent **initiated action** (e.g., no mention of going to the tracks or starting the act). Past self-harm (""cutting"") is noted but is non-lethal and distinct from suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not ""Indicator""**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent are present.  
   - **Not ""Ideation""**: Includes specific method (train tracks) and location, moving beyond general desire.  
   - **Not ""Attempt""**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (only a future plan).  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific plan/method (train tracks at a station) with no ambiguity about intent.

If I am forced to live then put me on a thorazine dri0 so I can be a zombie until the world lets me die.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""wanted to die"" daily for years and references past ""suicide attempts.""  
   - It expresses intense emotions (jealousy, anger, hopelessness) and a persistent desire to die (""my body, my choice means I should be able to kill myself"").  
   - Past suicide attempts are described (""I had a few suicide attempts""), including one where the author was saved.  
   - No specific *current* plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The demand for a ""thorazine drip"" is framed as a wish to escape suffering, not a suicide method.  
   - Temporal context focuses on historical attempts and ongoing ideation (""Every day [...] I have wanted to die""), with no imminent action stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""wanted to die,"" and lack of negation (e.g., no statement rejecting the desire to die) confirm a genuine current desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Past attempts are referenced, but no *current* plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past suicide attempts are acknowledged, but no *recent or ongoing* potentially lethal action is described. The focus is on enduring ideation and frustration.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I have wanted to die,"" ""kill myself"") confirms **Ideation**, not Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No current plan/method/preparation is mentioned, ruling out **Behavior**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Attempt**: Past attempts are historical; the post emphasizes *current* desire without describing a recent initiated action. **Attempt** requires a concrete past/recent action, not just ideation.  
   - **Final**: The core of the post is the author’s persistent, explicit desire to die without a current actionable plan. Past attempts don’t override ongoing ideation when no recent/current action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""I feel shame for failing,"" ""I'm going to try again,"" ""with a different method.""
   - Emotional indicators: Guilt, pain, anger, shame, hopelessness (""I’m such a fucking loser""), and perceived abandonment.
   - Plan/Method: References a past attempt (""shame for failing"") and specifics about a future method (""much easier and not so easy to back out of""). Though the exact method isn’t named, the adjustment implies planning.
   - Temporal context: Past attempt confirmed (""failing""), future intent (""tomorrow maybe,"" ""next week,"" etc.).
   - Action assessment: Describes a past *initiated action* (""failing"" implies an attempt) and future planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""I'm going to try again"" show a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - Yes: Adjusting to a ""different method"" to reduce backing out, with logistical considerations (hospital/math). This indicates planning, but the primary focus is on the **past attempt** (""failing"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Past event: Concrete action (""failing"" an attempt) is explicitly stated.
   - Future intent: Planning another attempt but no *immediate* action described (timing uncertain).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post confirms a **past suicidal action** (""shame for failing"")—a concrete, potentially lethal act initiated by the author. This meets the 'Attempt' definition, even though future plans are mentioned. The core disclosure of a past attempt takes precedence over current ideation/behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions intense distress: ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""It's over.""
   - Expresses hopelessness: ""No bueno,"" ""rot your brain,"" ""It's over.""
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""All I want is courage to end it"" (where ""end it"" strongly implies suicide).
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, location, or tools mentioned.
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.
   - No temporal markers indicating immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. ""End it"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent in this context of despair, equivalent to ""kill myself."" The phrase lacks negation (e.g., no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No. There is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). The post expresses a *wish* for courage to act but describes no concrete steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past or recent actions described. The focus is on current emotional state and desire (""All I want..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""end it"") places this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"") rules out 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""I'm offing myself"" and ""I'm going out of this world."" It expresses emotional indicators of hopelessness and worthlessness (""I'm not worth living""). There is a specific plan indicated by the exact date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours), but no details about the method (e.g., tools, substances) or other preparations (e.g., writing a note). The post is future-oriented, describing an intention to act, with no reference to past actions or attempts. The writer's desire to die is clear and not portrayed as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide with ""offing myself,"" which is a direct phrase equivalent to ""killing myself."" It expresses a clear desire to die with statements like ""I'm going out of this world"" and ""I'm not worth living."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, it leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific plan is mentioned: the exact date (April 13, 2021) and time (13:14 hours) for the suicide. However, no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described. ""Offing myself"" implies an action but lacks method details. Since a specific temporal plan is stated, it constitutes a plan under the 'Behavior' definition. The presence of a plan shifts this from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior', as per the guidelines.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going out"" on a specific future date and time) with no mention of past or recent actions. It does not describe any initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried but failed""), so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""I'm offing myself""), placing it beyond 'Indicator'. It includes a specific plan (date and time), which moves it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'. No method details are given, but the temporal specificity is sufficient for 'Behavior' as it constitutes a plan. There is no description of a past or recent action, ruling out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

   - Specific mentions include: ""I want to die peacefully,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" and repeated declarations of being ""done"" with life.  
   - No method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The reference to drinking (""get drunk"") is contextualized as coping, not a suicide method.  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are described; all statements reflect current feelings or future intent without initiation.

   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods (e.g., pills, weapons).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.
   - **No explicit desire to die**: While ""make it stop"" implies distress, it lacks a clear statement of wanting death (e.g., ""I want to die""). The focus is on relieving emotional pain, not ceasing to exist.

262,"I lost everyone in my life. I lost all of my friends in a fight recently. They called me selfish and reckless and said that they were done with me.

I feel lost and alone and like no one understands me. I tried going to therapy but I couldn't bring myself to actually talk to him about how I feel because it hurts so much I can't even think about it anymore. I hate myself, I make mistakes and make it everyone's life progressively worse. I can't anymore. I'm on the edge, I just can't do this. I would have done it already if I wasn't so afraid of botching it and ending up seriously hurt or in a mental hospital. Both would just make this living hell even more unbearable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**:  
     - Emotional distress: ""lost everyone,"" ""lost all my friends,"" ""mom is depressed,"" ""dad hates me,"" ""sister hates me,"" ""lost and alone,"" ""hate myself,"" ""can't anymore,"" ""living hell.""  
     - Hopelessness/despair: ""nothing is better than this,"" ""I don't belong here,"" ""nothing to look forward to.""  
     - Burden perception: ""make everyone’s life progressively worse,"" ""everyone would be sad if I did it, but their lives would be better.""  
     - **Suicidal Desire**: Explicitly states, ""I would have done it already if I wasn’t so afraid of botching it,"" indicating a genuine wish to die but restraint due to fear of failure/consequences.  
     - **Method/Plan**: No specific method, tools, location, or preparations mentioned. Fear of ""botching it"" implies consideration of methods but no concrete plan.  
     - **Past Actions**: None described (therapy attempt is non-suicidal).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I would have done it already"" directly expresses a personal desire to act on suicidal intent, restrained only by fear of failure.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While fear of ""botching it"" references hypothetical methods, no specific plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned or implied.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Future Intention**: Desire to act (""would have done it"") is conditional/future-oriented but not acted upon.  
   - **Past Actions**: None described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I would have done it"") confirms *Ideation*, not general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., ""botching it"" is vague; no specifics). Thus, *Ideation* fits.  
   - **Attempt**: No past/recent initiated lethal action described.

263,"Ramble about hating myself. Just joined but I have a problem. I'm a 30 year old Male single parent of a 7 about to be 8 year old son. I can afford my bills (barely) but we have food and a roof over our head. But even before he was born I have had depression. I'm sure his mom cheating on me and leaving us 4 years ago didn't help. ( Not doctor diagnosed but I assume do to always been looking at things as glass being empty and not wanting to live.) Now as I'm getting older I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life. Of course I will wait till he's an adult but I just can't seem to get my life together. Every job I have ever wanted I can't get because my experience is in different fields. Females don't like me because of the dad bod. I feel I'm at the point of just no success. I'm over being a failure. But I don't have motivation. I have tried but i just feel like a waste of space. This thing called a life is too much. I would say I'm suicidal but I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn't deserve that. 11 more years then yes I could be there but for now he just has a non successful dad that he is probably ashamed of. How do I deal with the pain of life. I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions suicidal thoughts explicitly (""I would say I'm suicidal"") and expresses a desire to die (""I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""Why am I even here""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I feel like I'm a failure,"" ""no success""), despair (""I serve no purpose but only suffer""), and feelings of being a burden (""failure to my son, my parents, and everyone""). There is a future intention to act (""Of course I will wait till he's an adult,"" ""11 more years then yes I could be there""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The writer states he lacks the courage to act now (""I don't have the balls to actually do it"") and won't act due to his son (""my son doesn't deserve that""). No past or recent suicidal actions are described; ""I have tried"" refers to life efforts, not suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""comfortable with leaving this life""). However, the writer also explicitly states he does not want to act on these thoughts now due to his son, indicating the thoughts are unwanted in the immediate sense, but the underlying desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned. The future timeframe (""11 more years"") is a condition but not a concrete plan with details. Therefore, no elements of planning or preparation are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions. The ""tried"" refers to general life struggles, not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die (""I'm suicidal,"" ""leaving this life"") indicates personal ideation, placing it above 'Indicator'. However, the lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The absence of past or recent initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'. The writer's statement about not wanting to act now (""don't have the balls"") suggests distress, but the core desire to die is explicit and personal, so 'Ideation' is the best fit. There is no ambiguity strong enough to default to 'Indicator' since the suicidal desire is clearly stated.

264,I'm struggling to hold on. Male 25. Been depressed and feeling like shit for years &amp; years. Struggling to hold on I just want off this life. Not sure who I'm talking to or why,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""struggling to hold on,"" ""depressed and feeling like shit for years,"" and ""I just want off this life."" There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""feeling like shit for years,"" ""struggling to hold on""). No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. The phrase ""want off this life"" suggests a desire to escape life but is indirect and metaphorical. No mention of plans, methods, imminence, or past actions. The writer expresses distress but does not specify suicidal intent or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - It expresses a desire to escape life (""want off this life""), but this is not a clear, explicit statement of wanting to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). The wording is ambiguous and could reflect general distress rather than a genuine wish to die. There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted, but no such thoughts are explicitly mentioned either.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The content focuses on emotional state without any indication of planning or actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing feelings (e.g., ""for years & years"") with no reference to past or recent actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal behavior or attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The primary sentiment is distress and hopelessness without a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire. The phrase ""want off this life"" is vague and could be interpreted as a wish to escape suffering rather than a direct desire to die. Given the ambiguity and lack of explicit suicidal intent, it aligns more with 'Indicator' (general distress) than 'Ideation' (explicit desire to die). No plan or method is present, ruling out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The instruction to choose 'Indicator' in cases of ambiguity supports this classification.

I'm 15, completely failing school, nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore, life just isn't worth it but I'm terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself,"" indicating a direct mention of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""life just isn't worth it""), anhedonia (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), and despair (""completely failing school"").
   - The author expresses concern about the impact on family and friends (""how do I minimise the amount that I hurt my family and friends,"" ""I'm terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends""), showing ambivalence but not negating the desire to die.
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The question about minimizing hurt implies consideration of consequences but does not detail a plan, method, or tools.
   - There is no reference to past actions or attempts; the content is focused on current thoughts and intentions.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated; the language is general.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" showing a clear personal desire to die.
   - The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them; the fear is about consequences for others, not a rejection of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The query about minimizing hurt is general and does not constitute a plan or method for carrying out suicide.
   - Since no explicit plan/method is present, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a future-oriented desire (""I need to kill myself"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed).
   - All content is about ideation, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The question about minimizing hurt is not equivalent to detailing a plan.
   - No described past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - The core of the post is a current personal expression of suicidal thoughts with a desire to die but without actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'.

266,"By this time next week I'll be gone. There's no possible way to turn my life around anymore. There's literally no point in trying anymore. My own body has given up on itself. I'm just so tired of fighting this constantly. Since my depression doesn't allow me to make any new memories, I'm constantly stuck living the old ones. It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'll be gone"" (implying death or suicide), expressions of hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around,"" ""no point in trying""), despair (""tired of fighting,"" ""can't escape""), and anhedonia/depression (""depression doesn't allow me to make new memories""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), locations, or past actions. The temporal context is future-oriented (""by this time next week""), indicating imminence but not immediacy. The writer expresses a desire to not be alive but does not state this as unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""I'll be gone"" is a direct implication of death or suicide, especially in the context of despair, indicating a personal desire to die. There are no explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the intent is clear from the hopelessness. The writer does not express that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to""), so it leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. ""I'll be gone"" is vague and does not detail a plan, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intent (""by this time next week"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interventions, or failures). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (""I'll be gone"") with hopelessness, fitting 'Ideation'. However, it lacks any plan, method, or preparation, which would be required for 'Behavior'. There is no ambiguity about the desire (it is not stated as unwanted), so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. With no past actions, 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as per the rule: if no plan/method is present, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal themes: ""I hope I don't make it"" (implying a wish not to survive), ""I don't want to survive another attempt"" (direct reference to a past suicide attempt), and ""I just want to die"" (clear desire for death). Emotional indicators like hopelessness and burden (e.g., parents complaining about medical bills) are present. There is no mention of a specific current plan, method, or preparation for suicide; the focus is on a past attempt and the desire to avoid surviving future ones. The temporal context is past-oriented (""another attempt"") with a general future wish (""I hope I don't make it""), but no imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated. The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""I hope I don't make it."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, they reflect a current personal wish.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""another attempt"" implies a past action but does not describe any current planning or means. Without current details, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""another attempt"" confirms a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that occurred previously (and was survived). This is a concrete suicidal act, not just thoughts. The writer also expresses a current desire to die, but the past attempt is clearly articulated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of a described past suicide attempt (""another attempt"") takes precedence over current ideation, as per the rules. The attempt was a potentially lethal action initiated by the author, fitting the 'Attempt' definition. While there is current suicidal desire (""I just want to die""), the explicit reference to a past concrete action shifts the classification to 'Attempt'. This is not 'Behavior' because no current plan or preparation is indicated, and not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' due to the past action and explicit desire to die.

There is no escape from the everlasting flames of life, death is the only escape.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly, and phrases like ""death is the only escape"" indicate a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""too far gone,"" ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life"") and distress about increasing intensity of thoughts. There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The temporal context is general (""as the days pass""), with no imminent timeframe stated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and expresses a clear desire to die through ""death is the only escape."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are described as intense and escalating.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, location) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The focus is solely on thoughts and feelings, not on planning or acting.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current and ongoing suicidal thoughts (""I wake immediately with suicidal thoughts"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, even interrupted ones). It is about thoughts, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die and mention of suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no description of past or recent actions, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. Thus, it best fits 'Ideation', defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or desire to die without a specific plan.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past events involving ""vaguely suicidal stuff"" and two specific events:  
     - First event: Testing a method until shortly before the point of no return. Explicitly states it was **not** an attempt.  
     - Second event: Went in with the **intention of dying** but stopped. Describes this as a past action that ""happened long enough ago.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress about categorizing past actions, feeling ""bothered"" afterward, and isolation (""only one that knows"").  
   - No current desire to die, plan, method, or preparation mentioned. Focus is on retrospective confusion.  
   - Temporal context: Both events occurred in the past (""long enough ago""), and the author is now in a ""tenuously better situation.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit current desire to die**. The post discusses **past intentions** (""I went in with the intention of dying"" for the second event), but this is historical. Current language reflects confusion and processing, not active suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan, method, or preparation**. Past methods are vaguely referenced (""method,"" ""point of no return"") but not specified. The focus is on categorizing past actions, not imminent risk.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past actions**:  
     - First event: Testing a method (not intended as lethal).  
     - Second event: **Initiated a potentially lethal action with intent to die** (""went in with the intention of dying"") but stopped. This qualifies as a past suicide attempt under the definition (initiated action, potentially lethal, interrupted by self).  
   - **No current or imminent actions** described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The second event meets the **'Attempt'** threshold: A self-initiated, potentially lethal action taken with intent to die, even though it was interrupted.  
   - The post focuses on **reflecting on this past attempt** (and another non-attempt event). There is **no current ideation, plan, or behavior** expressed—only distress about the unresolved classification of these past actions.  
   - Rules: **'Attempt' takes precedence** when a past concrete, potentially lethal action is described, regardless of current emotional state.

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

   - Explicit suicidal desire is stated: ""**I really want to die**.""  
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - References to past events (bullying, abuse) are contextual but do not describe any past suicidal actions.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned.  
   - ""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" refers to emotional numbness, not a suicide plan.

   - Describes preparation (""looking up how to do it"").  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""never ending pit""), despair, and anger.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases (""contemplating suicide,"" ""wish I had the courage to jump... or stab myself""). The desire to die is personal and current, with no negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (car, stabbing) and preparation (""looking up how to do it""). This indicates planning/research.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future intentions (""wish I had the courage"") and preparation (researching methods).  
   - **No** mention of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried""). Contemplation and research are preparatory but not actionable attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (suicidal intent) places this beyond 'Indicator'.  
   - Presence of specific methods **and** preparation (""looking up how to do it"") elevates it from 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I jumped but survived""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - Fits 'Behavior': Desire to die + plan/method (car/stabbing) + preparation (research).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""I'm so fucking done with this shit""), despair (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad""), and isolation (""be alone, disappointment and failure"").  
   - Explicit statements of desire to escape life: ""I want to leave and never come back,"" ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all.""  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring tools).  
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried..."").  
   - The nuclear bomb wish is a generalized desire for mass death, not a personal plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states a personal desire to cease existing (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave"").  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method**: Desires are abstract (""leave and never come back"") or hypothetical (nuclear bomb). No tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent concrete suicidal actions (e.g., attempts). Focus is on current emotional state and generalized wishes.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Clear **desire to die** (""I want out,"" ""never come back"") meets the threshold for *Ideation*.  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No initiated lethal actions rule out *Attempt*.  
   - Emotional distress is present, but the explicit personal wish to die elevates it beyond *Indicator*.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and mentions a specific method (""pull the trigger""). It expresses despair linked to racial pressure and implies a plan involving a firearm. There is no indication of past actions, preparations, or unwanted thoughts—the focus is on a future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. Phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" show a clear personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. ""Pull the trigger"" explicitly references a method (firearm) for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes a future intention (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""). No past/recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**Ideation** criterion met).  
   - Specific method (firearm) mentioned (**Behavior** criterion met).  
   - No descriptions of past/recent initiated actions (rules out **Attempt**).  
   - **Conclusion**: The combination of suicidal desire + specific method qualifies as **Behavior**.

And at work my forearms with my wounds are visible for everyone to notice but they just say thinks like work faster, go to bed earlier( sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time). I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") but frames it as a disclosed struggle, not an attempt to die.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""No one cares,"" ""tired of putting a mask""), isolation, and emotional pain.  
   - Explicitly links despair to death as an escape: ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free.""  
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means), or imminent timeline mentioned.  
   - Self-harm is historical and described as non-lethal; no initiated suicidal action is reported.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" expresses a clear desire to escape life via death, implying suicidal intent. No negation of this desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., tools, substances), plan (e.g., ""I will do X tonight""), or preparations are mentioned. Past self-harm is noted but not tied to a suicide attempt or current planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past action: Self-harm ""two months ago"" is disclosed, but it lacks context of being a suicidal *attempt* (e.g., no mention of lethal intent or method).  
   - No current/future concrete action (e.g., ""I will do X now"") is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong desire to die is explicitly stated (""Death seems like...""), so it exceeds general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Desire to die is present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated. Past self-harm is not framed as suicidal behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of a past or recent *initiated, potentially lethal action* (self-harm ≠ suicide attempt without stated intent).  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses a personal wish to die without actionable plans or methods → **Ideation**.

275,"More than anything I want help and to get better, but I can't tell anyone. I just moved out of home, I live on campus now. I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much. I wish I could tell someone this without getting hospitalized.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions feeling alone, sad, and hopeless, with explicit references to suicide (e.g., ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""write detailed plans in my journal,"" ""have long conversations with myself about suicide,"" ""I think about suicide every day,"" ""seriously consider it only once a week or so""). However, the writer explicitly states, ""I know I would never do it,"" due to fear of hell, and emphasizes a desire for help and getting better. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools, and no descriptions of preparations (e.g., acquiring means) beyond journaling thoughts. No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the focus is on internal thoughts and distress. The writer expresses fear of involuntary hospitalization and financial consequences, indicating a barrier to acting on thoughts. Temporal context shows ongoing distress for seven years, with suicidal consideration occurring weekly but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide"" multiple times, and the writer describes seriously considering suicide weekly. However, the writer clearly negates any desire to act, stating, ""I know I would never do it,"" and frames the thoughts as distressing but unwanted. The primary sentiment is a plea for help and improvement, not a genuine wish to die. This leans toward 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The writer mentions ""write detailed plans in my journal,"" but this is vague and lacks specifics about methods (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations are disclosed). Journaling thoughts could be seen as a form of preparation, but it is not explicit planning for action, especially given the writer's assertion that they would not act. With no clear method or preparation details, and considering the rule to choose 'Ideation' if unsure about an explicit plan, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and journaling over seven years, but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or descriptions of concrete events). The ""detailed plans"" are cognitive (written in a journal), not behavioral actions. This absence of any initiated, potentially lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but lacks a clear, current desire to die, as the writer explicitly states they would not act. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes mentions of suicidal thoughts when they are unwanted and not accompanied by intent. The journaling of plans is concerning but vague and not actionable, so it does not elevate to 'Behavior' (which requires explicit plans/methods) or 'Ideation' (which requires a personal desire to die). 'Attempt' is not applicable due to no described actions. The emphasis on seeking help and fear of consequences further supports 'Indicator'. If there is ambiguity about desire, 'Indicator' is chosen per the rules.

276,:(. I cant take it anymore. The pain is unreal.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains emotional distress indicators: "":("", ""I cant take it anymore,"" and ""The pain is unreal."" These express hopelessness and despair.
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - No references to plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - No past actions or attempts described.
   - The primary sentiment is about enduring intense pain, with no explicit personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a desire to die.
   - The statement ""I cant take it anymore"" suggests distress but does not clearly indicate a wish for death; it could imply a desire for relief from pain without suicidal intent.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, this leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional suffering with no reference to past or imminent actions. No concrete suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. It aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes expressions of distress without clear suicidal intent. Ambiguity about suicidal desire (as seen here) should default to 'Indicator' per the rules.

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of hopelessness or despair implied by the ironic tone (""That's the Higher Power in action""), suggesting that sobriety (via AA) has not alleviated suicidal thoughts but rather made acting on them possible.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past actions, such as attempts or initiated behaviors.
   - Imminence is not indicated; the statement is about general capability (""I think I'm capable"") rather than immediate intent.
   - The writer expresses a capability to commit suicide while sober but does not explicitly state a current desire to die or act on it, nor is there a negation of unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide,"" which is a direct phrase.
   - It expresses a personal capability related to suicide (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober""), but it does not clearly state a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"") or an intent to act. The focus is on ability rather than active wish.
   - There is no explicit statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to""), which might have leaned toward 'Indicator'. Instead, it is presented as a resigned realization.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present.
   - Since there is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current belief or thought about capability (""I think I'm capable""), with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""I think I'm capable of commiting suicide""), which aligns with 'Ideation' as it indicates the author is considering suicide as a possibility for themselves.
   - However, it lacks a clear, current desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" statement) and focuses on capability. Despite this ambiguity, the explicit personal mention of suicide moves it away from 'Indicator', which is for general distress or abstract/unwanted thoughts without personal intent.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Given the explicit personal suicidal thought, 'Ideation' is the best fit. The doubt rule (""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation... choose Indicator"") is not strongly applicable here because the personal expression of capability implies active suicidal ideation, even if desire is not explicitly stated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including self-loathing (""I'm a piece of shit""), hopelessness (""I hate every part of my life""), loneliness (""I don't want to be alone any more""), and a desire for relief (""I just want it to be over,"" ""I want to be down"" – interpreted as ""done"" based on context). The phrase ""Don't want to do this anymore"" suggests a wish to escape current suffering. However, there is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The emotional indicators are strong (despair, exhaustion), but no plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The writer's stated desire appears focused on ending emotional pain, not necessarily a direct wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent direct phrases.
   - The desire expressed (""want it to be over,"" ""want to be down"") is ambiguous; it could imply a wish for life to end, but it is not a clear, personal statement like ""I want to die."" The context emphasizes distress and exhaustion, not an unambiguous desire for death. There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted, but the lack of explicit suicidal terminology leans this toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. Being drunk is noted but not linked to a suicidal plan. Without any plan-related elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., attempts, preparations). Phrases like ""Don't want to do this anymore"" are declarative, not descriptive of initiated actions. Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows severe distress and a vague wish for things to ""be over,"" but it lacks explicit personal expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). Ambiguous phrases like ""want it to be over"" could relate to ending suffering rather than life itself, and with no plan or method, it does not meet 'Ideation' criteria (which requires explicit suicidal desire). Given the ambiguity and rules to default to 'Indicator' when suicidal intent is unclear, this fits 'Indicator'. It also aligns with the definition of expressing general distress without a clear current desire for suicide.

279,I have attempted suicide 11 times. I have embraced my role in the universe as an existential terrorist. I will use my suicide to disturb people for my own satiafaction. I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" indicating past suicidal actions that were initiated and potentially lethal. It also states a future intention with ""I will use my suicide to disturb people,"" expressing a clear desire to die by suicide for personal satisfaction. Emotional indicators include anger and hatred (""I hate capitalism""), but the focus is on suicidal actions and intent. There is no specific method, tool, location, or preparation described for the future suicide (e.g., how it will be carried out). The past attempts are concrete events, while the future statement is a general intent without imminence (e.g., no timeframe like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and states a desire to die (""I will use my suicide""). The suicidal thoughts are not presented as unwanted; instead, they are embraced for personal satisfaction.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - For the future suicide (""I will use my suicide""), no specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no details on means, location, or steps). This lack of specificity means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The past attempts are described but are not current plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past actions: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" confirms specific, self-initiated, and potentially lethal actions that occurred in the past. This is distinct from the future intent. The past actions qualify as 'Attempt' because they were concrete events, even if they failed or were interrupted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The mention of past suicide attempts takes precedence over other elements. According to the rules, if a post describes past or recent initiated actions that were potentially lethal (even if failed), it should be classified as 'Attempt', regardless of concurrent ideation or future intent. Here, the past attempts are clear and dominant. The future statement (""I will use my suicide"") indicates current suicidal ideation but lacks a plan or method, so it would not alone qualify as 'Behavior'. Since the past actions are emphasized, 'Attempt' is the appropriate category.

I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes significant life stressors (breakup, job loss, isolation) and intense emotional distress (""given up completely,"" ""just want the pain to end"").  
   - **Explicit statement**: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now"" directly references past suicidal actions.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (""given up""), despair (""don't recognise myself""), and desire for relief (""want the pain to end"").  
   - **Past actions**: Three suicide attempts are explicitly stated. No current plan/method is mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Tried to kill myself"" is a direct admission of personal suicidal actions. The phrase ""just want the pain to end"" implies a desire for cessation of suffering, linked to past suicidal behavior.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is described. The focus is on **past actions** (attempts).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions**: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times"" confirms initiated, potentially lethal acts. The phrase ""by now"" anchors these as completed events.  
   - No current behavior (plan/preparation) is indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post centers on **past suicide attempts** (""tried to kill myself 3 times""), which meets the 'Attempt' definition (concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions).  
   - While current distress and passive desire for relief (""want the pain to end"") are present, they do not override the explicit description of past attempts.  
   - Rules specify: If past attempts are described, 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior.

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""It doesn't get better,"" ""no miracle is coming""), loneliness, and physical/mental pain.  
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: References specific methods (shotgun, handguns through the upper palate, overdosing) and fears about failed attempts (e.g., paralysis from overdose).  
   - Expresses a desire to die (""End it now"") but also fear of methods (""terribly scared of how to accomplish death"").  
   - Discusses research/consideration of methods (caliber differences, outcomes like Mark Linkous's case) but no indication of active preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) or past/current actions.  
   - No description of initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried X yesterday"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""End it now"" and detailed method considerations show a current personal desire to die, not merely unwanted thoughts. The fear of methods does not negate the underlying desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific methods (firearms, overdose) are mentioned and evaluated (e.g., caliber effectiveness, paralysis risks). This indicates planning, even if theoretical or fear-driven. No preparations (e.g., ""I bought a gun"") are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intentions (""End it now"") and hypothetical outcomes. No description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to shoot myself""). Mentions others' experiences (Mark Linkous) but no personal attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""End it now"") and method details rule out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present, and specific methods/planning (firearms, overdose research) are discussed, meeting 'Behavior' criteria. Fear of failure does not downgrade this.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No described initiated actions (e.g., ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - **Conclusion**: The combination of explicit suicidal desire and method/plan details fits 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress with phrases like ""Can't do any of it!"" and ""Just don't want this anymore,"" indicating hopelessness and a desire to escape. The key element is ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,"" which is a euphemism for death or not wanting to be alive, but it does not explicitly mention suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and a sense of being overwhelmed, but there are no references to plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. The language is metaphorical and lacks imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").
   - The writer's stated desire is to avoid life by ""never waking up,"" which implies a wish to die, but it is not framed as unwanted thoughts or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - The phrase ""sleep and never ever wake up"" expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive, as it is a common euphemism for death. There is no indication that this desire is unwanted or negated by the author.
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' because the desire to die is personally expressed, even if indirectly.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned. The content is focused on a general wish to escape life, not on actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, interventions, or failures). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows a personal desire to die (via the ""never wake up"" metaphor), which aligns with 'Ideation' (explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive).
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - The lack of explicit suicide terminology or unwanted thoughts rules out 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is a genuine wish to not exist.
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not relevant.
   - The metaphorical language does not create sufficient ambiguity to default to 'Indicator' per the rules, as the desire to die is clear and personal.

   - Emotional indicators include exhaustion (""tired of everything""), hopelessness (""What's the point""), and fear.  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - The temporal context is present-focused (""want,"" ""am scared""), with no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer expresses ambivalence (""I want to die but I'm scared"") and seeks help (""Can someone please help me""), but does **not** explicitly state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they reject acting on them (e.g., no phrase like ""I don’t actually want to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""I want to die"" (twice), confirming a personal desire to die. The fear of dying does not negate this expressed desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings/thoughts only. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit ""I want to die"" confirms personal suicidal desire, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire to die).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, so it cannot be 'Behavior'.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The core elements align with **Ideation**—explicit desire to die without a stated plan or action. The fear and plea for help reflect distress but do not override the expressed intent.

I don't have a logical reason to have these thoughts. Though I likely have some psychiatric issue. But I am really suffering emotionally. 😔 I feel so hopeless, I will never be ok. I will just suffer till I end it. I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home. I know these things. It must be a Tuesday to run away.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times and includes phrases like ""end it,"" indicating direct suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators are strong, with expressions of hopelessness (""I feel so hopeless, I will never be ok""), suffering, and despair. Specific plans are detailed: the author states ""I have a plan,"" knows the location (""I know where I'll attempt""), method (""I know how""), means (""I know what I need""), and timing (""It must be a Tuesday to run away""). There is ambivalence (""idk if I should do it""), but the overall context shows a genuine desire to escape suffering through suicide. No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and phrases like ""end it,"" which convey a clear personal desire to die. The thoughts are described as distressing but not explicitly unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on this""). The hesitation (""idk if I should do it"") does not negate the underlying desire, so this is not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, specific elements of a plan are present: location, method, required means, and a timeline (Tuesday). This includes ""I know where I'll attempt,"" ""I know how,"" ""I know what I need,"" and details about running away. These indicate concrete planning and preparation, moving beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions (""I will just suffer till I end it,"" ""run away from home"" planned for a Tuesday) with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. All references are to planning, not acting, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire and a detailed plan with method, means, and timing places this in 'Behavior'. It is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear personal desire to die; not 'Ideation' because a specific plan is mentioned; and not 'Attempt' because no action has been initiated. The ambivalence does not override the planning elements, and 'Behavior' is appropriate for thoughts combined with preparation.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, anger, and hopelessness due to family conflict and feelings of isolation. Key suicidal elements include:  
   - Explicit expressions of a desire to die (""want to die,"" ""I do not want to exist anymore"").  
   - References to suicidal urges (""fighting the urge to go wandering off into the night,"" ""I want to be done"").  
   - Emotional indicators: despair (""I have no one else,"" ""I'm done""), hopelessness (""can't see a solution or a way out""), and feeling like a burden (""made to feel guilty for doing them a favour"").  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Urges are passive (""wandering off,"" hoping ""something bad happens"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""want to die"" and ""I do not want to exist anymore"" indicate a personal desire to die.  
   - The thoughts are framed as distressing but not explicitly *unwanted* (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing). The urge to ""go wandering off"" is vague and lacks suicidal specificity.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *current* urges and despair but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). ""Almost hope something bad happens"" implies passive risk, not self-initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""want to die"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method mentioned; passive urges don’t constitute preparation.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past/current self-initiated lethal actions.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""ideations of suicide"" and ""most days I wish I wasn't alive."" 
   - It expresses hopelessness (""Life is too painful,"" ""can't imagine a future""), shame, isolation, and depression.
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes). 
   - The author references concealing suicidal thoughts from their therapist but does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. Phrases like ""ideations of suicide"" and ""most days I wish I wasn't alive"" reflect a personal desire to not be alive. The thoughts are not framed as unwanted intrusions (e.g., no language like ""I don’t want these thoughts""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No. There is no mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - The post describes ongoing feelings and thoughts but **no past or recent initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). Isolation and withdrawal are noted, but these are not concrete suicidal behaviors. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a **clear desire to die** (""wish I wasn't alive""), placing it beyond *Indicator* (which lacks personal suicidal intent). 
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*. 
   - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action (e.g., attempt) rules out *Attempt*. 
   - This fits *Ideation*: explicit personal suicidal thoughts/desire without specifics of plan or action.

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""thinking about killing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include extreme loneliness, hopelessness (""I never will [have friends]""), despair (""I can't take this anymore""), and self-loathing (""What the fuck is wrong with me?"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - The suicidal thought is presented as conditional (""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be...""), implying the thoughts stem from distress rather than a fixed desire to act.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""killing myself"" is an explicit, personal reference to suicide.  
   - The conditional framing (""If I had... I wouldn't"") suggests the thoughts are unwanted but does **not negate the current desire to die**; it contextualizes the desire as driven by loneliness.  
   - No explicit statement rejecting the thoughts (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, tools, or preparations** are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and ideation, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current suicidal thoughts**, not past actions. Phrases like ""thinking about"" and ""can't take this anymore"" indicate present distress, not initiated behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""thinking about killing myself"") with **no plan/method** places this in **Ideation**.  
   - The conditional language does not reduce it to 'Indicator' because the author still personally expresses a current desire tied to suicide.  
   - Absence of past actions rules out 'Attempt'; absence of plan/method rules out 'Behavior'.

It feels like I'm strapped with heavy,ocked chains to the driver's seat of a car that has no brakes and is going at highway speed at night with weak lights and I have no idea where I'm going, and I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointles situation to stop by crashing into another car an frequently come close to doing it but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me and that I'll be restrapped into the car again.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post uses a metaphorical scenario of being trapped in a car with no brakes, wanting to crash to end ""constant anxiety and sadness."" It explicitly mentions a desire to die by crashing (""I want the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car"") and recurrent urges (""frequently come close to doing it""). However, it states no actual action is taken due to fear of survival (""never can because I'm afraid...""). There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (""pointless situation""), despair, and anxiety. No specific real-world plan, method details, preparations, or past actions are described; the car crash is symbolic.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die to escape suffering (e.g., ""I want... to stop by crashing""), even though it's metaphorical. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the user describes a genuine wish to act but is held back by fear.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method is implied (crashing a car), but it is part of an extended metaphor and not a concrete, real-world plan. There are no mentions of specific tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no note-writing or acquiring means). The phrase ""come close to doing it"" suggests intense ideation or urges but not tangible steps toward action. Since the method is metaphorical and no explicit plan/preparation is evident, this leans toward 'Ideation' (per rules: if unsure about plan/method, choose 'Ideation').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes recurrent thoughts (""frequently come close"") but explicitly states no action is taken (""never can""). There is no indication of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no actual crash attempt). The focus is on current/future desires without behavioral follow-through.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire and thoughts (ruling out 'Indicator'), but lacks a real-world plan, method, or preparation (ruling out 'Behavior'). No past or recent action is described (ruling out 'Attempt'). The metaphorical method and ""come close"" language indicate strong ideation without behavioral elements. Per rules, when a method is mentioned but ambiguous or non-literal, default to 'Ideation'.

My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes emotional distress (e.g., ""empty loneliness,"" abuse from job and parents) and explicitly states ""I'm going to kill myself,"" indicating a personal desire to die. It adds ""Only a matter of when,"" which implies inevitability but lacks specificity on timing, method, plan, or preparation (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, substances, notes, or actions taken). There are no references to past suicide attempts or actions initiated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide (""I'm going to kill myself"") and expresses a clear, personal desire to die without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Only a matter of when"" suggests intent but is vague and does not constitute a plan. Without a clear plan or preparation, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself"") with no description of past or recent concrete actions (e.g., no initiated suicide attempts). Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. The emotional context (loneliness, abuse) supports distress but does not override the explicit suicidal intent. Since no past attempt is described, 'Attempt' is not relevant. The vagueness of ""Only a matter of when"" does not introduce a plan, so 'Ideation' is the best fit.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""death is an option"" and questions whether this constitutes suicidal thought. The author explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no current intent to act. The hypothetical scenario involves an accidental death (""if somehow I got an accident and die""), not self-initiated suicide. Emotional tone is passive acceptance (""It's not the worst outcome"") without expressions of active desire, hopelessness, or burden. No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or clear desire to die. The author explicitly negates acting on thoughts (""I won't commit"") and frames death as a passive, hypothetical outcome. Suicidal thoughts are questioned but rejected as representing personal intent. **Leans toward 'Indicator'.**

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. The only reference to death is accidental and external (""accident""), not self-directed. **No evidence for 'Behavior'.**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No past or recent actions described. The content is entirely theoretical (e.g., ""thinking death is an option,"" hypothetical accident). **No evidence for 'Attempt'.**

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses abstract thoughts about death but lacks a personal desire to die or act. The author explicitly disavows suicidal action (""I won't commit"") and frames death as unwanted but tolerable in a hypothetical accident. This aligns with 'Indicator' (distress about abstract thoughts without personal intent). Ambiguity about suicidal desire resolves to 'Indicator' per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill me"" (direct suicide intent), ""tonight"" (imminent timeframe).  
   - Emotional indicators: Ambivalence (""I wish I didn’t have to do this"") but resolves to act (""doing the right"").  
   - Plan/preparation: ""planned this,"" ""have the stuff prepared and everything.""  
   - Imminence: ""Tonight is the last chance.""  
   - Desire: Expresses a current wish to act (""finally kill me"") despite reluctance.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""kill me"" is a direct phrase.  
   - Yes, ""tonight is the last chance"" confirms a desire to act imminently.  
   - The reluctance (""I wish I didn’t have to"") is overshadowed by commitment (""im doing the right"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method implied (""kill me"") but not specified.  
   - Explicit preparations: ""have the stuff prepared,"" ""planned this.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""Tonight"") with past planning (""a year since I planned"").  
   - **No initiated action described** (e.g., no past/current attempt). Preparations are noted, but no lethal act has started.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + imminent timeframe + preparations = **Behavior**.  
   - ""Ideation"" is ruled out due to preparations (""stuff prepared"").  
   - ""Attempt"" requires initiated action (none here).  
   - Reluctance doesn’t negate intent or planning.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, but the author states they are ""too much of a pussy to kill myself,"" indicating they are not acting on direct suicidal methods due to fear.
   - However, the author expresses a clear desire for death through an alternative method: ""I've decided to stop eating all together and starve myself I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends."" This shows a wish to die, supported by emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I see no reason to fuel it with energy"") and self-loathing (""I hate my body"").
   - A specific method is mentioned: starvation, which is a means to achieve death. The phrase ""I've decided"" indicates preparation or initiation of this behavior.
   - There is no reference to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current/future intentions.
   - Imminence is not specified, but the decision is stated as current.
   - The desire to die is personal and genuine, as the author hopes for their life to end through starvation, despite not choosing direct suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" and the desire to die is clear from ""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends."" The author's statement about being too scared to kill themselves does not negate the overall desire to die; it simply shifts the method to starvation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""stop eating all together and starve myself."" This is a potentially lethal means.
   - Preparation is indicated by ""I've decided,"" showing intent to initiate this behavior.
   - This points toward 'Behavior' due to the explicit method and decision to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current decision and future intention (""I've decided to stop eating""), not a past or recent initiated action. There is no description of having already started starving or any concrete, potentially lethal action that was carried out (e.g., days without eating). Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""this just ends""), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicidal desire).
   - The mention of a specific method (starvation) and preparation (""decided"") moves it from 'Ideation' (desire without plan) to 'Behavior'.
   - Since no past or recent initiated action is described, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post includes suicidal intent with a plan/method.

It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""not ok,"" ""broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness.""
   - References past suffering (""dragged my face through the muds of life"") but frames it as endured (""somehow I'm still standing"").
   - Explicitly states fluctuating suicidal thoughts: **""I don't always wish to be gone""** (implying sometimes they do, but currently not a consistent desire).
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  
   - Focuses on confusion, fear, and loneliness but concludes with hope for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone"") and a positive sign-off (""Much love"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or unambiguous expressions of current desire to die.  
   - The phrase ""wish to be gone"" suggests passive ideation but is **explicitly negated as a constant desire** (""I don't always"").  
   - Primary sentiment is distress about life circumstances and emotions, not a stated intent to act on suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, plans, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past suffering but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills"").  
   - Current feelings are emotional distress, not descriptions of imminent or concrete suicidal behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress, loneliness, and passive thoughts of ""wishing to be gone"" but **explicitly disclaims consistent desire**.  
   - Lacks explicit personal desire to die *in the present context* and has no plan/method/preparation.  
   - Dominant themes are hopelessness and confusion, but suicidal ideation is not the focus and is framed as unwanted/transient.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'** per rules: ambiguous/unwanted suicidal thoughts without clear current intent, and no plan/action.

The only person I have is my sibling, but I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause. When I look at myself, I just feel pathetic and wish I wasn't so broken. I want a restart :/",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal"" directly, indicating personal suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Why push on when you barely having anything to look forward to?""), despair (""I feel like I've permanently fucked up this life""), anhedonia (""depressed constantly""), and feelings of being a burden (""I only feel worse knowing I'm hurting to delay the pain my death will cause""). There is a desire for escape expressed through ""wish I could restart on life"" and ""I want a restart,"" but no specific mention of death, dying, self-harm methods, or preparations. No past actions or attempts are described. The temporal context is present-focused, with no imminent plans (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" as a personal state (""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely""), indicating current suicidal thoughts. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to die (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to act on it""). The conflict about delaying death due to a sibling suggests distress but does not negate the expressed desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content focuses on thoughts and emotions without concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts only. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted behaviors) are referenced. All statements are about internal states, not initiated actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal"" confirms a personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts, aligning with 'Ideation' (defined as explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts without a plan or preparation).
   - There is no plan/method/preparation, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - While there is distress and conflict (e.g., delaying death to avoid hurting the sibling), the absence of explicit negation of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I don't want to die"") prevents a downgrade to 'Indicator'. The primary sentiment is a current expression of suicidal ideation.
   - Per the rules: If in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator', but here the explicit use of ""suicidal"" reduces ambiguity, supporting 'Ideation'.

295,"Work is killing me but I can't quit. Suicide becoming more enticing. Tl;Dr: Working retail has destroyed my body but can't stop working or family will lift a fuss. Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""whether it would be best to end myself,"" ""if I do [take my own life].""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nothing is happening,"" ""stagnant,"" ""life was set up for failure""), despair (""destroyed my body,"" ""pathetic""), burden (""family will lift a fuss,"" ""paycheck sapped"").  
   - Plans/methods: No specific method, tool, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - Past actions: No reference to initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").  
   - Imminence: ""I don't know if or when"" and ""if nothing changes"" imply uncertainty, not immediacy.  
   - Desire: Expresses genuine consideration of suicide as relief (""best to end myself,"" ""enticing""), not unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""end myself"" and ""take my own life"" indicate personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No: Mentions contemplating suicide but lacks any specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no ""I have pills"" or ""going to the bridge"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on current/future thoughts (""I’ve been thinking,"" ""if I do""), not past actions. No description of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""end myself"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned; uncertainty (""if or when"") and abstract phrasing (""head out"") lack concrete planning.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no past/current lethal actions described.

If my lines are even remotely accurate then i wont have much time to live. Goodbye",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of self-harm and suicide: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" and ""I want to get it over with."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I am not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people"") and a sense of burden.
   - Specific methods and preparations are detailed: researching the radial artery location, marking it, and using a dremel with a saw attachment to cut the wrists.
   - The action is described as completed or imminent: ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""if you are seeing this then it's already too late,"" indicating the act was initiated recently.
   - The author expresses a clear and personal desire to die, with no indication of the thoughts being unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly describes self-harm with suicidal intent (e.g., ""slit my wrists"" as a method, ""my death"").
   - Yes, a clear desire to die is expressed: ""I want to get it over with.""
   - No, suicidal thoughts are not portrayed as unwanted; the author is acting on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (cutting the radial artery with a dremel saw attachment) and preparations are detailed (researching, marking, tool setup).
   - However, the presence of an already-initiated action shifts focus from planning to execution.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a very recent, self-initiated, and potentially lethal action: ""I just slit my wrists"" and the description of carrying out the act.
   - This is a concrete, life-threatening action that has been initiated, as evidenced by the statement that it may be ""too late"" upon reading.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content goes beyond ideation or behavior due to the description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.
   - 'Attempt' is appropriate because the author describes a specific self-harm action that has been carried out, which is the defining criterion for this category.
   - 'Behavior' would apply if only plans/preparations were mentioned without action, but here the action is explicit and recent.
   - 'Ideation' is ruled out due to the presence of a method and initiated action.
   - 'Indicator' is not relevant as there is explicit suicidal intent and action.
   - The past action (slitting wrists) takes precedence over any current ideation, aligning with 'Attempt'.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself. Is it better to be honest or is keeping quiet, potentially for his own health, better?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The author explicitly states: ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself."" This indicates personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to keep going myself"") and feeling like a burden (""it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself""). 
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, timelines, preparations, or past/current actions related to suicide by the author. The focus is on internal conflict about disclosing their own suicidal feelings to a friend. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. The author directly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and expresses a personal desire to die (""I don't want to keep going myself""). There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**. The author discloses suicidal thoughts but mentions no method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations. The post centers on emotional distress and secrecy, not actionable steps. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - **No initiated actions**. The author references persistent suicidal feelings but describes no past or recent self-harm attempts (e.g., no pills taken, no self-interrupted actions). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I'm suicidal,"" ""I don't want to keep going""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**. 
   - Lack of any method, plan, or preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
   - Absence of past/recent concrete suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**. 
   - While distress and internal conflict are present, the explicit personal wish to die distinguishes this from **Indicator** (which requires ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire or unwanted thoughts).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include blame (""everyone else's fault""), resentment (""treating me different""), and hopelessness (""everything is their fault"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.  
   - The phrasing is conditional (""*if* I become worse and do something bad or kill myself""), framing suicide as a hypothetical future outcome, not an immediate plan or past action.  
   - The writer expresses a potential desire to die (""kill myself"") but does not negate or reject this thought (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**, it expresses a conditional desire to die (contingent on ""becoming worse"").  
   - The suicidal thought is not framed as unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, tool, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to suicide is generic.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses a **future hypothetical scenario** (""if I become worse"").  
   - **No** description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts, preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit personal desire to die is present (""kill myself""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No concrete past/recent suicidal action rules out **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""state my hopelessness,"" ""no hope""), despair (""desperate,"" ""meaningless torture""), and emotional vulnerability.  
   - Explicitly mentions past suicidal desire: ""i wanted to die when i made that post.""  
   - **Crucially negates current desire to die**: ""i just don't want to die.""  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Focuses on emotional distress and frustration over a deleted draft.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""wanted to die"" explicitly references suicidal desire.  
   - However, this is immediately countered by the author’s **explicit rejection** of that desire (""i just don't want to die""), framing the suicidal thought as unwanted and past-tense (""when i made that post"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The post discusses emotional struggle and a deleted draft, not actionable steps toward suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal desire (""wanted to die"") is tied to a past moment (drafting the deleted post).  
   - **No description** of any initiated self-harm action (e.g., no overdose, attempt, or interruption).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses suicidal thoughts but **explicitly states they do not want to die**, framing the ideation as unwanted and situational (linked to the draft incident).  
   - The core sentiment is **distress about hopelessness and isolation**, not active suicidal intent.  
   - **No plan/preparation** exists to elevate to 'Behavior', and **no past lethal action** for 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress with passive/unwanted suicidal thoughts, lacking current desire to act.

   - No past or recent actions (e.g., attempts, interruptions) are described.  
   - The phrase ""I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not"" indicates ambivalence, but the explicit suicidal intent remains.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states, ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself,"" confirming a current personal desire to die. The ambivalence (""but I'm also not"") does not negate the explicit suicidal intent expressed earlier.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" ""fear of death,"" and ""hope that I don't wake up,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It's a neverending cycle,"" ""I'm done""), despair, and internal conflict (fear preventing action). No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned—parents have ""taken any means,"" but the author doesn't describe their own plan, tools, or actions. The phrase ""I could do it right now"" suggests potential immediacy but lacks concrete details. There are no references to past suicide attempts or initiated actions; instead, the focus is on current thoughts and feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""killing myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""the only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death"" and ""hope that I don't wake up""). The desire is personal and current, though conflicted by fear. The thoughts are not framed as unwanted or distressing in a way that negates the desire; instead, fear is a barrier to acting on the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. References to parents removing means are preventative and not an indication of the author's own planning. Phrases like ""I could do it right now"" imply potential capability but lack any description of how, where, or with what. Without explicit details, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and desires, not past actions. Statements like ""I haven't"" acted and the absence of any described initiated behavior (e.g., no mention of attempts, interruptions, or failures) rule out 'Attempt'. The content is focused on present ideation and emotional struggle.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire or unwanted thoughts). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the expressed desire to die without concrete plans or behaviors.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die,"" showing a clear, personal desire to die.

   - Expresses persistent desire to not be alive (""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over"") since 2012.  
   - References recurring suicidal ideation (""first time I thought about it"") and regret for not acting.  
   - No explicit current plan, method, or preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes mentioned).  
   - No description of past *actions* taken to attempt suicide (only thoughts/wishes).  
   - Temporal context: Focuses on past feelings/regrets (""years ago,"" ""since 2012,"" ""back,"" ""first time"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""not doing it"" imply a desire to die. Regret over inaction confirms suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Past thoughts only**: Describes persistent *thoughts* and *wishes* but no concrete past *actions* (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). Regret centers on *inaction*, not interrupted/failed attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (suicidal ideation) is present.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No past/current initiated lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desires are personal, explicit, and not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts alone (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

**Conclusion**: Fits **Ideation** (persistent suicidal thoughts/desires without plan or action).

306,"How thinking about the administrative side of suicide makes me not want to, while still wanting to die. Hi everyone,. I'm depressed and suicidal. I have past the point where i have written a note that also includes what i want each person to recieve that was mine. But, everytime i think about killing myself I also think about the things i should cancel before so that my family doesn't have to. I don't think anyone wants to deal with someone elses administrative stuff while they're dead. It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions being ""suicidal,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""killing myself."" It references a specific preparation: ""written a note"" that includes instructions for distributing belongings. Emotional indicators include depression, hopelessness, and feeling like a burden (concern about family dealing with administrative tasks). The user describes a recurring conflict: a persistent desire to die, but administrative concerns (e.g., canceling things for the family) act as a barrier to action. No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, and no past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., taking pills, attempting self-harm) are described. The temporal context involves ongoing thoughts and preparations, but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""killing myself,"" and expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""still wanting to die,"" ""ready to die""). The administrative concerns are a practical barrier, but they do not negate the underlying desire to die (e.g., the user states they ""still want to die"" despite these thoughts). Therefore, this is not a case of unwanted thoughts leaning toward 'Indicator'; the suicidal intent is explicit and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is mentioned. However, clear preparations are described: ""written a note"" with instructions for belongings, and recurring thoughts about canceling administrative tasks to avoid burdening the family. Writing a suicide note is explicitly cited in the 'Behavior' definition as a preparation. Since preparations are present, this leans toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past preparations (e.g., writing the note) and recurring thoughts/readiness (""times where I just get ready to die""), but no concrete, initiated suicidal actions are mentioned. ""Getting ready to die"" implies preparation, not an action like ingesting substances or using a weapon. As there is no description of a past or recent potentially lethal action (e.g., an overdose or self-harm attempt), 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal intent). The mention of preparations (written note and administrative planning) rules out 'Ideation' (which is for thoughts without plans/preparations). As no initiated lethal action is described, 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it encompasses suicidal thoughts/desire combined with preparations (e.g., the suicide note).

   - Describes a past non-suicidal action (trespassing).  
   - **No** mention of initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."" related to self-harm).

   - Explicit personal desire to die (""suicidal"") is present → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations → Rules out *Behavior*.

This country is a prison colony and it appears to be testing grounds to removing the flaws and imperfections in the human race and turning men into women.It's what hitler devised that he wanted to remove the flaws and imperfections and  wanted to purify the human race.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and feelings of entrapment (""We are all slaves,"" ""no freedom""). It uses metaphors of oppression (Auschwitz, prison colony) and references historical atrocities (Hitler's ideology). 
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to self-injury.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die"" appear. 
   - Metaphors about societal control/hopelessness **do not translate to personal suicidal desire**. The distress is externalized (anger at the system), not internalized as self-harm intent. 
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of genuine or unwanted suicidal thoughts. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparations for self-harm. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No descriptions** of past/current suicidal actions or attempts. Focus is entirely on sociopolitical grievances. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**. 
   - Qualifies as **'Indicator'** due to:  
     (a) Abstract distress about life/society without suicidal self-references.  
     (b) No ambiguity about suicidal intent (since none exists).  
     (c) Strict adherence to rules: When no desire/plan/action is present, default to 'Indicator'.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post is written from the perspective of a person expressing distress about their online friend's severe situation.  
   - The author mentions their own suicidal feelings (""I'm suicidal myself"") but does **not** elaborate further on personal suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or actions.  
   - Key elements focus on the friend: multiple suicide attempts, abuse, mental health struggles, and the author's helplessness. The author’s distress stems from fear of losing the friend and frustration over being unable to help.  
   - No explicit personal desire to die, method, plan, preparation, or past action by the author is described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author states ""I'm suicidal myself"" but provides **no elaboration** on personal desire, intent, or thoughts about suicide. This is a passing reference without context or detail.  
   - The statement is isolated and lacks any expression of a *current personal wish to die*. The primary focus is the friend’s crisis.  
   - **No** explicit personal suicidal desire is articulated.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of personal plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide by the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The author describes **no past or recent personal suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").  
   - The phrase ""I'm suicidal myself"" is vague and lacks any indication of initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is the author’s distress, fear, and helplessness regarding their friend’s situation.  
   - The author’s mention of being suicidal is **unelaborated and incidental**, lacking clear desire, intent, or context. It does not rise to ""Ideation"" (which requires explicit personal expression of suicidal desire).  
   - **No evidence** of personal suicidal thoughts with desire (Ideation), plans (Behavior), or actions (Attempt).

   - No references to past actions, attempts, or self-harm.
   - No temporal context indicating imminence (e.g., ""now,"" ""tonight"").
   - The writer's stated desire is a genuine wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to die.
   - Yes, the writer clearly states a wish to not be alive, with no negation of these thoughts (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to"").

   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., gathering tools, writing a note) are present.
   - The plea is directed at others (""you""), but this does not constitute a plan or method by the author themselves.
   - Without any plan or preparation, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current state of despair but no past, recent, or future actions initiated by the author.
   - No description of a concrete suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried to..."") that would indicate an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**

   - Absence of a plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No initiated lethal actions rule out 'Attempt'.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above.

   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are described.

I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains expressions like ""I wish I could die"" and ""I wish I could curl up and die,"" indicating despair and hopelessness.  
   - Emotional indicators include feeling like a failure, low motivation (""effort just to get up""), and depression.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""I wish I could die"" explicitly express a desire to die. However, these are contextualized as reactive (to parental conflict) and lack conviction (e.g., ""I would worry about them [dogs] if I died"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, timelines, or preparations.

I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling disgusted, hateful towards self, and ""wanting to kill myself.""  
   - Describes suicidal thoughts as intrusive (""ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself"") and emphasizes distress (""Terrible feeling,"" ""wanted to get it out of my head"").  
   - No specific plan, method, location, or preparation for suicide (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, timelines).  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""took steps,"" or ""failed attempt"").  
   - Emotional focus is on self-loathing and coping mechanisms (porn/masturbation), with suicidal thoughts presented as unwanted and distressing.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrase: ""wanting to kill myself"" (Yes).  
   - However, the context frames it as an intrusive thought during a coping mechanism (""masturbating to the thought""), followed by active rejection (""wanted to get it out of my head""). The desire is negated by distress and disgust.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of a method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., ""pills,"" ""gun,"" ""note"").  
   - Suicidal thought is abstract/fantasy-based (""thought of killing myself""), not operationalized.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Refers to a past mental event (fantasizing about suicide) but no physical action taken.  
   - No initiated, interrupted, or failed suicidal act described (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""almost did"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thought is present but explicitly framed as unwanted and distressing.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No concrete action taken → rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The core is **distress about intrusive suicidal thoughts without a current desire to act**, aligning with 'Indicator' (suicidal thoughts explicitly rejected/experienced as unwanted).

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post discusses philosophical views on suicide, arguing against societal stigma and framing it as a personal solution.  
   - Explicit personal statements: ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life,"" ""I’m the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision,"" and ""talking about wanting to end my life.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I never wished to be born""), isolation (""No one is really listening""), and despair (""There is no support"").  
   - **No mention** of specific plans, methods (tools/locations), preparations (notes/means), or past actions.  
   - Temporal context: References are abstract/future-oriented (""when I end my life""), not immediate (""tonight"") or past attempts.  
   - Desire: Explicitly states a **personal wish to die** (""I will get what I want when I end my life"") without negation or framing thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""end my life,"" ""wanting to end my life,"" and ""kill themselves"" (in advocacy context) show clear personal desire for suicide.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: While suicide is discussed as a solution, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (timing/location), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). Focus is on beliefs and future intent without concrete steps.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not Indicator**: Expresses explicit personal desire to die (""end my life""), not just distress or abstract discussion.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Lacks any plan/method/preparation or description of initiated actions.  
   - **Ideation**: Strong, explicit desire to die (""I will end my life"") with no plan/method.

318,"""your not cutting your faking it!"" stares at my arm motherfuckerly. Im tired of all the people who miraculously believe that im either cutting for attention or faking it. I've had issues with self harm in the past and I've gotten to the point where nobody really believes that im in pain. A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions self-harm (cutting) and scars, but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or suicidal methods**.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""wonder if it's even worth it anymore""), distress over being invalidated, and past numbness/emptiness.  
   - Describes **past self-harm actions** (cutting when girlfriend was out) and invalidation by others.  
   - **No stated desire to die, suicide plans, methods, or preparations**. The phrase ""wonder if it's even worth it"" expresses existential despair but not active suicidal intent.  
   - Suicidal encouragement (""encouraging K to kill herself"") targets another person (the girlfriend), not the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a personal desire to die. The closest expression (""wonder if it's even worth it"") is vague and lacks direct suicidal language.  
   - Self-harm is framed as coping (""relieve some of the pain""), not a suicide attempt.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** for suicide is mentioned. Past self-harm (cutting) is discussed, but it is not linked to suicidal intent or methods.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - References **past self-harm** (cutting incident months ago).  
   - **No initiated potentially lethal suicidal action** described—cutting is presented as non-lethal coping, not an attempt to die.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Distress, hopelessness, and past self-harm are present, but **no personal desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt** is expressed.  
   - Self-harm ≠ suicidal behavior unless lethal intent is confirmed (here, it is not).  
   - Ambiguous despair (""worth it"") leans toward **Indicator** per rules: Vague without explicit suicidal desire.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts.""
    - Expresses distress, hopelessness (e.g., ""spiraling worse""), barriers to coping, and fear of worsening mental state.
    - States a clear desire *not* to act on suicidal thoughts (""I'd rather go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"").
    - No mention of specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.
    - No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions (only ideation).
    - Focuses on seeking help and practical barriers (insurance, job concerns).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - Yes, explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts.""  
    - **However**, explicitly negates desire to act (""I don't think I'm a danger to myself,"" ""I'd rather go to the hospital than act""). The core sentiment is distress about *unwanted* thoughts, not a current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned.  
    - References to ""hospital"" are about seeking help, not a suicide plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Describes *current* ideation and distress, but **no past or recent concrete self-initiated suicidal actions**.  
    - No indication of imminent intent or initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated as unwanted and not acted upon.  
    - No plan/method/preparation → rules out *Behavior*.  
    - No past/recent initiated action → rules out *Attempt*.  
    - While suicidal ideation is personally expressed, the explicit negation of desire to act and absence of plan aligns with **Indicator** (distress about unwanted thoughts, focus on seeking help).  
    - Per guidelines: If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly unwanted/negated, choose *Indicator*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of desire to die: ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I will be forced to go to some institution""), feeling betrayed by family (""Fuck them! They will pay""), and despair about medication (""it just kills me inside"").  
   - Mentions daily heroin use, which is self-destructive but **not explicitly framed as a suicide method**.  
   - No specific suicide plan, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no note, no acquisition of means for suicide).  
   - The phrase ""Soon I will be finally dead"" implies a future outcome but lacks details on *how* it will occur (e.g., via heroin, institutionalization, or other means).  
   - Past action (taking antipsychotics) is described negatively but is **not a suicidal act**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead"" express a clear, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific suicide plan/method**: Heroin use is risky but not explicitly linked to suicide (e.g., no ""I’ll OD to die""). Institutionalization is an external event, not a self-initiated plan.  
   - **No preparations**: No mention of gathering tools, writing notes, or goodbye gestures.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future outcomes (""soon"") without describing a concrete, self-initiated action.  
   - Past antipsychotic use is not a suicidal act. Heroin use is ongoing but not framed as a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/current potentially lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions using a gun to target the brain stem, which is a specific suicide method. It dismisses common deterrents like family concern or future regrets, indicating hopelessness and a lack of value for life.
   - There is a focus on method details (gun position for lethality), suggesting preparation or planning.
   - No past actions are described; the content is future-oriented (seeking information for potential action).
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die, as they reject reasons to live and seek efficient means for self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""hitting the brain stem"" with a gun is an unambiguous reference to lethal self-harm.
   - The author's dismissal of concerns (""I genuinely do not care"") confirms a personal desire to die, not unwanted thoughts. Thus, intent is clear.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (gun to brain stem) is explicitly mentioned and elaborated on (seeking optimal positioning).
   - Inquiring about effective implementation indicates preparation, as it shows active planning to increase lethality.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions; there is no description of any initiated past or recent action (e.g., no mention of having attempted or acquired means).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') due to explicit suicidal desire and method details.
   - It exceeds 'Ideation' because a specific method (gun) and preparation (seeking positional advice) are present.
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent action is described.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the author expresses suicidal thoughts with a plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions persistent suicidal thoughts: ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself"" and ""it wont leave my head.""
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""everything just keeps getting worse"") and distress from invalidation by the mother's reaction to self-harm scars.
   - Self-harm scars are mentioned, indicating past self-injurious behavior, but this is not explicitly linked to a suicide attempt (self-harm can be non-suicidal).
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, hanging), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is described.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or timeline for acting on suicidal thoughts.
   - The writer expresses persistent suicidal ideation but does not state a clear desire to act on it or explicitly reject the thoughts (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" indicating direct personal suicidal thoughts.
   - It expresses a desire to die through the persistent thoughts, but there is no explicit statement negating or rejecting the desire (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""). The focus is on the intrusive nature of the thoughts, not a disavowal of suicidal intent.
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are personally expressed without clear evidence of being unwanted in a way that negates desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""self harm scars"" describes past self-injurious behavior, but it is not presented as part of a suicide plan or attempt (e.g., no link to ""killing myself"" in terms of method).
   - Without any indication of planning or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing suicidal ideation (""every day"") and past self-harm (scars), but no specific, initiated suicidal action is detailed.
   - Self-harm is mentioned, but it is not framed as a suicide attempt (e.g., no description of a potentially lethal action intended to cause death). The mother's reaction focuses on the self-harm as dramatic, not as an attempt.
   - There is no description of a past or recent suicidal act that was initiated, interrupted, or failed, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression of personal suicidal thoughts (""thought about killing myself"") with persistent desire indicates 'Ideation'.
   - Lack of plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - Absence of a described past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of suicidal thoughts without clear disavowal of desire means it is not 'Indicator' (which would require abstract discussion or explicit unwanted thoughts).
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the core of the post is the author's recurring suicidal thoughts without escalation to planning or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore""), despair (""I still feel like trash""), and anhedonia (""No amount of sleep helps""). It explicitly mentions suicide (""killing myself"") and a desire to act (""Let's just do it""), indicating a personal wish to die. There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or acquiring means). The phrase ""I'm sick of life"" reinforces distress and a desire to escape but lacks concrete details. The temporal context is present/future-oriented (""Let's just do it""), with no references to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" which is a direct suicide reference. It also expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself,"" ""Let's just do it""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator' as the suicidal intent is personal and affirmative.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned. ""Killing myself"" is a general statement without elaboration on means. No preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering tools) are described. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" implies impulsivity but doesn't specify a plan. Since there is no explicit plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (""Let's just do it""), with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no references to self-harm, attempts, or interventions). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""Let's just do it""), placing it above 'Indicator'. However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. The rule states: ""If no plan/method is present, choose 'Ideation'."" Additionally, ""Let's just do it"" suggests intent but is vague and not actionable enough for 'Behavior'; the uncertainty here defaults to 'Ideation' per guidelines.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" ""my first attempt,"" ""tried to overdose three times."" 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I give up""), self-hatred (""I hate every little thing about myself""), feeling like a burden (""does that really matter if I don't love myself""), and anhedonia (""I don't want to get better"").
   - Specific methods/preparations: References past overdoses (method) and states intent to ""attempt again"" imminently (""Just a few more hours"").
   - Past actions: Describes three overdoses since leaving the hospital and a prior ""first attempt"" (initiated, potentially lethal acts).
   - Imminence: ""Just a few more hours"" indicates immediate intent for future action.
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""I want to die"" without negation; rejects recovery.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""I want to die"" and ""attempt again"" are direct expressions of desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Method: Overdosing (mentioned as past actions). Future method is unspecified but implied by ""attempt again"" in context of prior overdoses.
   - Preparation: Not explicitly mentioned for the imminent attempt, but past actions confirm capability/means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes past suicidal actions: Three overdoses and a prior attempt (concrete, potentially lethal acts initiated by the author). 
   - Also states imminent future intent (""attempt again"" in hours).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past overdoses and ""first attempt"" are clear instances of initiated, potentially lethal behavior (defining 'Attempt'). 
   - Despite future intent (""attempt again""), the detailed description of **past concrete actions** (overdoses) takes precedence per rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - The post meets 'Attempt' criteria due to specific, self-initiated past behaviors, even if current plans are mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains key elements: explicit mention of being ""suicidal"" and a belief they won't ""make it past this summer,"" indicating hopelessness and a desire to die. The phrase ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" strongly implies suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include despair from the dismissive reaction of the mother (smirked, rolled eyes). There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means), or past actions initiated by the author (e.g., ""I tried to...""). The timeframe ""this summer"" suggests imminence but is not immediate (e.g., ""tonight""). The author expresses a genuine desire to die without stating the thoughts as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal thoughts. It also expresses a clear desire to die through ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""). Thus, this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) is mentioned or implied. No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present. The suicidal desire is evident, but the lack of a plan or method means this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past disclosure to the mother about suicidal feelings, but this is not a self-initiated suicidal action. It expresses future intent (""don't think I'll make it past this summer"") but no concrete, initiated action (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday""). Therefore, there is no basis for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""time for me to fucking go"") rules out 'Indicator'. The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The core content involves suicidal thoughts and desire without actionable elements, fitting 'Ideation'.

327,"It's over for me. I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work. I promise I wont fail this time. I'm gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes to the one I love. Gonna be gone after this weekend. I'm so sorry. I'm so, so sorry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""Believe me, I tried,"" ""I promise I won’t fail this time,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend,"" and specific method reference (""hanging is painless"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I'm broken,"" ""I'm damaged""), self-hatred (""I am trash,"" ""I hate myself""), guilt, and despair.  
   - Specific plan/method: Explicitly references hanging (""I have heard hanging is painless"") and preparations (""buy the right stuff,"" ""Say my goodbyes,"" timeline of ""after this weekend"").  
   - Past actions: States prior suicide attempts (""I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work"").  
   - Imminence: Clear timeline (""after this weekend"").  
   - Desire to die: Unambiguous personal desire (""I should have killed myself,"" ""I promise I won’t fail this time"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""tried"" (referencing past attempts), and ""gonna be gone"" (impending death). No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Method (hanging) and preparations (""buy the right stuff,"" ""say my goodbyes"") are specified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past attempts** (""I tried,"" ""it didn’t work"") and **future plans** (""after this weekend"").  
   - Past actions are concrete suicidal acts (initiated but failed), meeting criteria for 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past potentially lethal actions (""tried"") dominate the classification per rules ('Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior).  
   - Despite current plans (method/preparations), the explicit description of a past concrete attempt mandates 'Attempt'.  
   - Rules: ""If a post refers to such past attempts [...] it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""

Ill update back on this post innnn 8 yrs or so. Maybe? Who knows. No promises &gt;:) anyway, I hope you all have a great day and thank you for reading to whatever this is",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and sets a future timeframe (at age 25 or 30).  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""this life for me isn't it"") and feeling life ""isn't worth it,"" but the author also expresses gratitude and openness to seeking help over time.  
   - There is **no specific method, tool, location, or preparation** mentioned for suicide (e.g., pills, jumping, notes).  
   - The timeline is distant (""8 yrs or so""), with no imminent intent.  
   - The desire to die is conditional (""if I still feel the same or worse""), and the author explicitly states they have time to ""rethink"" and ""seek out help.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""I'm planning on killing myself,"" expressing a personal desire to die under future conditions.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation** is described. The mention of ""planning"" refers only to a vague future age (25/30), not actionable steps (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses **future intentions** (years away), with no description of past or recent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""killing myself"") qualifies for **Ideation** or higher.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is present (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""bridge,"" ""gun,"" ""note""), ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., ""I tried""), ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The conditional nature (""if I still feel the same"") and distant timeline do not negate the current expression of suicidal desire, but the absence of concrete planning keeps it in *Ideation*.

329,"Been teetering on the edge lately. Because as a queer person I'm perceived as male and a threat. Now I know why the suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women, and I have so much respect for cismen who have to deal with being eyed with suspicion.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""teetering on the edge lately,"" which is vague and metaphorical, potentially indicating emotional distress or instability. It references the high suicide rate for men in a societal context (""suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women""), but this is statistical and impersonal. The author discusses being a queer person perceived as male and a threat, expressing empathy for cisgender men. There are no explicit mentions of personal death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are not directly stated; the focus is on societal issues and personal identity struggles. No imminence (e.g., ""tonight""), past actions, or preparations are described. The author does not express a personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases in a personal context (e.g., ""suicide rate"" is discussed statistically, not as a personal intention). There is no clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive from the author. Suicidal thoughts are not personally claimed; instead, the author reflects on external rates. Therefore, no explicit personal suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned or implied. The content remains general and lacks any planning elements related to suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a general state (""lately"") without reference to past, current, or future suicidal actions. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses distress about identity and societal issues, with abstract references to suicide (e.g., discussing suicide rates), but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or actions. The phrase ""teetering on the edge"" is ambiguous but, in context, relates to emotional strain rather than suicidal intent. Per the rules, when in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator. This fits 'Indicator' as it conveys general distress without explicit personal suicidal desire.

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" in the context of the mother's comment (""suicide is a coward way to go out""), but the author personalizes it with ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" and a farewell message (""Peace out all...""). This indicates a personal threat of disappearance or death, tied to suicidal ideation.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., the sad emoticon and the resigned tone), and the author feels invalidated or burdened by the mother's statement.
   - There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The ""gone within 24 hours"" suggests imminence but lacks concrete details.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on a future possibility.
   - The desire to die is implied (e.g., ""I'm gone"") but not explicitly stated as unwanted; the tone suggests resignation rather than resistance to suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (though indirectly via the mother), and phrases like ""I'm gone within 24 hours"" in this context express a clear personal desire to die or not be alive. The farewell reinforces this intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted by the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The threat is vague (""gone within 24 hours"") with no details on how it would be carried out. This absence of concrete planning elements means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""within 24 hours"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt or action taken). Therefore, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm gone""), which moves this beyond 'Indicator' (general distress without suicidal intent). However, the lack of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. The temporal context is future-oriented with no action taken, so it is not 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures explicit suicidal thoughts and desire without specific plans.

331,"Abused as a child. I was abused by my parents as a child, and I currently still live with them as an adult, because I don't have a choice. The authorities have been contacted on them before, but the authorities didn't believe me (I have no proof of the abuse), and they just dismissed me, and basically told me I was being a bratty, ungrateful teenager to my well-meaning but imperfect and loving parents. My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them. I hate myself for letting them do that, but they threatened my safety and possibly even my life if I did pursue legal action against them. I'm being pretty much forced into staying silent about their abuse, and it's killing me. This is the only place I can talk about it. I currently can't go to counseling. My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post details severe emotional distress stemming from ongoing childhood abuse, manipulation by parents, and feeling trapped in the current living situation. Key elements include:
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I don't have a choice""), despair (""it's killing me""), self-blame (""I hate myself""), and fear (""they threatened my safety"").
   - Metaphorical language: ""it's killing me"" expresses intense suffering but is not literal.
   - Focus on abuse, helplessness, and desire for escape (restraining order, moving out), **not** death/suicide.
   - No mentions of suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, killing oneself, or a desire to die.
   - Phrases like ""it's killing me"" are idiomatic expressions of distress, not literal intent.
   - The author expresses a desire for safety/escape (restraining order), not death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No reference** to suicidal plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes past abuse and ongoing distress but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (attempts, interrupted acts, etc.).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows severe psychological distress (hopelessness, trauma, fear) but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or action**.
   - The phrase ""it's killing me"" is metaphorical and does not indicate suicidal ideation or intent.
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** as it expresses extreme distress without suicidal thoughts/behavior.

What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions self-harm (""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend,"" ""I'm self harming again,"" ""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and explicitly references suicide (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now and save time"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (e.g., failing to stop self-harm, feeling it will ""end badly,"" urgency with ""a matter of time"" and ""now"").
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). Self-harm is described but not framed as a method for suicide; it is presented as a separate behavior.
   - The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now""), with no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action. Self-harm is discussed as a recurring issue but not as a suicide attempt.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""I should do it now,"" indicating a direct and personal desire to die.
   - There is no statement negating or expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this""). The tone is one of inevitability and intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. References to self-harm (e.g., ""bloodying myself up"") are not tied to a suicide plan; they are separate actions. Without an explicit plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past and current self-harm, but self-harm is not equivalent to a suicidal act unless specified. There is no description of a past or recent concrete, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., no mention of an overdose or hanging that was initiated). The suicidal statements are future-focused (""before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now""), indicating intent but not action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die, fitting 'Ideation' (suicidal thoughts with desire). 
   - Lack of specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No initiated suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - The presence of self-harm and distress alone do not elevate it to a higher category, as self-harm is not synonymous with suicide risk in this context. General hopelessness is present but is secondary to the explicit suicidal intent.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes direct mentions of death and suicide: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me."" These indicate a personal desire for death.
   - Emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness are present: ""im fucking done,"" ""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people,"" and guilt/self-blame (""i deserve death,"" concern about hurting others: ""before i hurt someone"").
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, location), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described by the author for carrying out suicide themselves. The phrases ""blow my head off"" and ""kill me"" are pleas for external action, not descriptions of the author's own plan.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts (e.g., no initiated lethal actions).
   - Imminence is implied (""please kill me"") but not tied to a specific timeframe or the author's own imminent plan.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""i fucking deserve death""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions death/suicide with phrases like ""blow my head off"" and ""kill me,"" which are direct.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""i fucking deserve death"").
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; the desire appears genuine.
   - This rules out 'Indicator' and points toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned but is framed as a request for someone else to act, not as the author's own plan or preparation. There is no description of the author considering or organizing a method for themselves.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - Since there is no clear indication of the author having a specific plan or engaging in preparations, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior' (per the rule: if unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions.
   - No specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author is described (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed).
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), fitting 'Ideation'.
   - It lacks a specific plan, method, or preparations by the author, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - The absence of past or recent initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The genuine desire to die distinguishes it from 'Indicator', which involves distress without suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - Conclusion: 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the author expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without evidence of planning or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""my only option,"" ""it won't work out long term"") and anxiety about future instability.  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, hanging) or **preparations** (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described.  
   - The phrase ""if I ended my life right now"" frames suicide as a hypothetical/future action, not a past or initiated act.  
   - The author expresses a **genuine wish to die** as a solution to problems, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. The lack of negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") confirms genuine desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., tools, locations, timing beyond ""right now""). Suicide is presented abstractly as a solution.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intention** (""if I ended my life right now""), not a past or recent initiated action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no genuine suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/initiated lethal action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Ideation** fits: clear personal desire to die (""end my life"") with no plan/method.

335,"Why was I born. My whole life I've been a failure. I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal actions and intent. Phrases like ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all"" and ""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" indicate specific self-harm actions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Why was I born,"" ""I've been a failure""), despair (""I despise myself""), and feeling like a burden (""if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down""). The author expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up""). The temporal context is recent (last 4 days, specifically yesterday), and the actions were initiated but failed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""end it all,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up""). The suicidal thoughts are not portrayed as unwanted; instead, they reflect a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned: overdose on ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers."" This constitutes a concrete plan and means for suicide. Preparations or actions are evident in the consumption of pills.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past actions: the author initiated a potentially lethal act by taking pills yesterday, which failed (as they woke up). This is not just ideation or planning; it is a concrete, self-initiated action that was life-threatening. The reference to failing ""twice in the last 4 days"" suggests multiple attempts, but the described pill overdose is a clear example.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit suicidal desire. It exceeds Ideation (which lacks a plan/method) because a specific method (overdose) is mentioned and acted upon. It also surpasses Behavior (planning/preparation) because the author describes an initiated, potentially lethal action (taking pills). According to the rules, even if current ideation is present (""I want to die""), the description of a past, concrete, potentially lethal action (the pill overdose) takes precedence for the 'Attempt' category. The action was self-initiated and failed, fitting the definition of 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""horrible life,"" ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse,"" ""I have nothing""). It discusses external factors like societal issues, family rejection, cultural pressures, and unfairness. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods/means, or preparations. The focus is on distress and venting, with no references to past or current suicidal actions. The temporal context is general complaints about life circumstances, with no imminent intentions stated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon"" related to self-harm). The writer's stated desire revolves around frustration and victimization, not a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent; statements like ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse"" are general and not personal expressions of suicidal intent).
   - No discussion of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted), so this doesn't apply.
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicidal intent present, leaning strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of any specific suicide method (e.g., pills, guns), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes).
   - No indications of planning or intent to act on suicidal thoughts.
   - Conclusion: Absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past life experiences (e.g., bullying, family issues) but no past suicidal actions, attempts, or initiated self-harm (e.g., no references to ""I tried to"" or ""I took pills"").
   - No current or future suicidal intentions are expressed.
   - Conclusion: No evidence of a past or recent attempt, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or past action.
   - It fits the 'Indicator' category: general distress and abstract discussion of life's unfairness without explicit suicidal intent. The emotional indicators (e.g., despair) are present, but they don't cross into personal suicidal ideation.
   - Rules applied: Suicide risk is only for the author; no ambiguity about desire to die, so 'Indicator' is appropriate. If in doubt, default to 'Indicator' per guidelines.

337,"I'm feeling suicidal about my parents getting to know about me drinking and smoking. Yesterday I was caught in my dorm room for possession of 2crates of empty alcohol bottles and 10gm pack of weed. Note: both are prohibited in my dorm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
    - Mentions ""feeling suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" and ""the only escape to this situation is suicide.""  
    - Expresses hopelessness (""I feel like a burden,"" ""only escape""), despair, and panic.  
    - **No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
    - Focuses on *current* distress and fear of consequences (parents discovering substance use, possible suspension).  
    - Describes suicidal thoughts as escalating but **no reference to past/ongoing actions** (e.g., ""I tried X yesterday"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""feeling suicidal"" and ""the only escape ... is suicide.""  
    - The desire to die is personal and current (e.g., ""escape this situation"").  
    - **No** indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **No** mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, location, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  
    - Focus is on emotional distress, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Discusses *current* suicidal thoughts and dread about future events (management’s decision).  
    - **No description of past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., ""I tried to overdose yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - Strong explicit desire to die (""suicidal,"" ""only escape is suicide"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
    - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
    - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
    - Fits *Ideation*: Personal, explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or preparatory actions.

338,"Coward.?. I know the way I will end it. Yet the times I have tried, fight or flight kicks kn amd i jump away at the last minute. I really thought I had put all this suicide ideation behind but . i really am up against a wall and rock or however that saying goes. I have been through SO MUCH and even just one thing is so twisted and brutal that .my whole story is just too much for anyone to hear . I really don't think I have anyone except my two friends I have known for a decade . One actually called 911 the first time I actually attempted.and my mom, I also have my mom. There is someone I love deeply but I am pretty sure they want nothing to do with me and honestly.all the pain I have gone through is nothing compared to the pain I feel now for knowing I fucked up something good with someone I love. No I do not want someone else or meet someone new. My heart is too tired and fragile. This person I love knows me.after them. I really do not want anyone. And I was doing better but my living situation. And all the accumulated trauma. And getting no justice at all. Amd seeing the people who fucked me up get their happily ever after and I am left wanting to jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink. I do not want to hurt the few people who love me or even the person I love .but i really do think nobody would care.and my death would make many happy probably. I just want to know how not to be a coward and jump away when I see it approaching. I really do not want to do this . But I know this is all I have left. How do I stay on the tracks? I know the train schedule pretty well because I live really close to the tracks. But when I see it, I panic and jump away and start crying. Help?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""suicide ideation,"" ""end it,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""up against a wall,"" ""nobody would care,"" ""my death would make many happy""), and specific methods (jumping in front of a train). It references past suicide attempts (""the times I have tried,"" ""the first time I actually attempted"") where actions were initiated but interrupted (e.g., jumping away at the last minute). Current intentions are indicated with a plan (""I know the way I will end it,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" ""know the train schedule""). The writer expresses ambivalence about acting (""I really do not want to do this"") but a persistent desire to die (""this is all I have left"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide ideation"" and phrases like ""end it,"" ""jump in front of a train,"" and ""attempted,"" showing a personal desire to die. The statement ""I really do not want to do this"" reflects internal conflict but does not negate the overall suicidal intent, as it is coupled with expressions of inevitability (e.g., ""this is all I have left""). Thus, it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"") and there is implied preparation through knowledge of the train schedule and proximity to the tracks. However, the focus shifts due to the description of past actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes both past and current/future intentions. Crucially, it details past, self-initiated, potentially lethal actions: ""the times I have tried"" with specific reference to jumping away at the last minute, and ""the first time I actually attempted"" (which involved emergency intervention). These are concrete, interrupted suicide attempts. Current ideation and planning (e.g., wanting to ""stay on the tracks"") are present, but the past actions are clearly described and take precedence per the guidelines.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal desire and a current plan, which might suggest 'Behavior'. However, the rules prioritize 'Attempt' when a past, concrete, potentially lethal action is described, even if interrupted or failed. Here, multiple past attempts are explicitly mentioned, including one with external intervention (""called 911""). Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit, as it overrides concurrent ideation or behavior references.

339,People tell me I'm a burden. I'm 23. I haven't left the house since I was 14. I don't have a job. I still live at home. I lay in bed all day.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions feelings of being a burden (""People tell me I'm a burden""), which is an emotional indicator linked to suicide risk. It also describes severe social isolation (""I haven't left the house since I was 14""), unemployment, dependence (""I don't have a job. I still live at home""), and inactivity (""I lay in bed all day""), indicating hopelessness and despair. However, there are no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The language focuses on the author's current life situation and emotional state without expressing a desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., no statements like ""I want to be gone"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of unwanted thoughts or a negation of desire. This strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. This absence supports 'Indicator' or 'Ideation', but since no suicidal desire is present, 'Indicator' is more appropriate.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing circumstances (e.g., current isolation, unemployment) with no reference to past, recent, or future suicidal actions. No initiated or completed self-harm is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content expresses general distress and risk factors (e.g., burden, hopelessness) but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, or intent. Without explicit suicidal ideation, it cannot be 'Ideation'. There is no plan or method, so 'Behavior' is inapplicable. No past actions indicate 'Attempt'. Given the ambiguity rules, when no clear suicidal desire is present, 'Indicator' is the appropriate category.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions explicit suicidal intent: ""I can kill myself on graduation night"" and ""I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life"".  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""Things aren't getting better""), isolation, and feeling unloved/burdened.  
   - Specific method is stated: ""stick some knives through my stomach"".  
   - Timeline is specified: ""on graduation night"".  
   - No description of past actions taken (e.g., no initiated suicide attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""stick knives through my stomach"" show a clear, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: Knives to the stomach.  
   - **Timeline**: ""on graduation night"".  
   - **No explicit preparations** (e.g., acquiring knives, writing a note), but the method and timeframe constitute a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intent** (""graduation night""), not a past or recent initiated action.  
   - No mention of prior attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide-related actions: ""commit"" (short for commit suicide), researching tall bridges (a specific method), having ""a few methods to try,"" and drafting suicide notes (preparation).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""It doesn't seem to exist, not for me anyway"") and despair (""I can't anymore"").
   - Specific plans and preparations are present: researching bridges, drafting suicide notes, and a timeline to act after the holiday (""commit when I get home"").
   - No references to past initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of trying a method and failing). The actions described (researching, drafting notes) are preparatory, not lethal acts.
   - Imminence is not immediate; the plan is set for after the holiday.
   - The writer's desire to die is clear and resolved (""It's settled""), with no indication of unwanted thoughts or ambivalence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide with ""commit"" and implies a desire to die through phrases like ""I can't anymore"" and the overall context.
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no expression of not wanting to act on thoughts). The intent is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""tall bridges"" and ""a few methods to try.""
   - Preparations are confirmed: ""I've already drafted my suicide notes.""
   - This indicates planning, not just ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past preparatory actions (researching bridges, drafting notes) and a future intention to act (""commit when I get home"").
   - No initiated, potentially lethal actions are described (e.g., no mention of starting an attempt like taking pills or jumping). Preparatory actions alone do not constitute an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of specific methods (bridges, other methods) and preparations (drafted notes) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).
   - Since no past or recent initiated lethal action is described (only planning and preparation), it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
   - This fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent, stated plan/methods, and concrete preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains multiple explicit references to suicide, such as ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't"" (a euphemism for suicide), and ""end it."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore""), relief (""This is a blessing,"" ""a weight off my chest""), and ambivalence (""there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it""). Specific preparations are mentioned, like ""looking into my options to end it all,"" ""getting my ducks in a row"" (implying organizing for suicide), and planning to ""wish you all a farewell."" No specific methods (e.g., pills, guns) or locations are detailed, but the language indicates active consideration of options. The context is future-oriented (""once I'm ready,"" ""it could finally be my time""), with no description of past actions or attempts. The desire to die is clear and personal, not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and uses direct phrases like ""end it all"" and ""commit lifen't."" It expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I'm finally free to end it all,"" ""free to commit lifen't""), despite some ambivalence. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, they are embraced as liberating. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - While no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is named, the post mentions preparations: ""looking into my options to end it all"" implies researching methods, and ""getting my ducks in a row"" suggests concrete steps like organizing affairs or gathering resources. This indicates planning and preparation, leaning toward 'Behavior'. The lack of a named method introduces some uncertainty, but the explicit references to active preparation satisfy the 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions (""once I'm ready,"" ""it could finally be my time"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""getting my ducks in a row"" are preparatory but not actions taken. Since no potentially lethal action has been initiated (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took""), 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place it beyond 'Indicator'. The presence of preparations (""looking into options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row"") elevates it from 'Ideation' (which would be desire without plan/preparation) to 'Behavior'. Although no method is specified, the preparations are mentioned, and the rules state that any mention of preparation leans toward 'Behavior'. Uncertainty due to vagueness is mitigated by the clear preparatory language. No past action rules out 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""want to kill myself,"" ""need to kill myself,"" and ""constantly suicidal,"" indicating a direct personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't just go from... overnight""), frustration (""It's all bullshit""), and feeling trapped (""stay and suffer"").  
   - The author references ""assisted suicide"" as a solution but does **not** specify a plan, method (e.g., pills, location), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means).  
   - No past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.  
   - Temporal context focuses on ongoing struggles (""constantly suicidal""), not imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""need to kill myself"" show a clear desire to die. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" further reinforces this intent.  
   - No statements negating the desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current ideation** (""constantly suicidal"") but **no past/recent initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself"") meets **Ideation** criteria.  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods (e.g., ""use X drug,"" ""go to Y bridge"") rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/recent self-initiated lethal actions rules out **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It specifies having ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,"" indicating a method (overdosing) and possession of means (specific substances in quantities). The phrase ""soon"" implies imminence but not immediate action. There is a clear desire to die expressed, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. No past actions are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""end myself"" is an explicit phrase for suicide, and the desire to die is personal and current.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (overdosing) and means (Benadryl and Prozac) are mentioned, and possession (""have"") indicates preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""gonna end myself soon"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal desire and includes a specific plan/method with preparation, fitting the 'Behavior' category. It does not describe an initiated action (so not 'Attempt'), and the presence of a plan rules out 'Ideation'. The clear suicidal intent distinguishes it from 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions past actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" This describes specific, self-initiated actions involving a method (knife to wrist) that were potentially lethal but stopped. 
    - Explicit desire: ""I feel like I just need to [commit suicide]"" and imagining death (""family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood""). 
    - Emotional indicators: Loneliness, feeling like an inconvenience, hopelessness (""better off without me"").

   - No specific method, plan, timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described.  
   - The suicide reference (""kill myself"") indicates a personal desire tied to unmet emotional needs, with no indication the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent. The author states a conditional desire (""I would like to feel that before I kill myself""), confirming a current wish to die if their need remains unmet.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No** method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The suicide reference is conditional and abstract, lacking actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a future intention (""before I kill myself"") but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., attempts, interrupted efforts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Clear desire to die expressed personally (""kill myself""), with no plan/method.

347,"Fuck life, I'm out. This world fucked me over and the feeling of knowing that your entire life will be filled with misery and pain is the worst feeling I've ever experienced in my life. I'm not motivated to do anything, my grades are dropping because I have no motivation and I'm always overthinking which makes me forget about my assignments or just makes me incapable of doing any work. I just feel like none of my friends like me, I'm the one trying to keep the friendship in tact but  it seems like no one else is trying to make the effort. I feel unwanted and I don't have anywhere else to go, I can't tell if they hate me or I'm overthinking but all I know is that I'll never receive the attention or commitment that I give to anyone. I can't tell anyone how I'm actually feeling because I know that it would push them away and they couldn't help in the first place. I've always had a solution to my issues when I was younger, like putting a bandaid on a scratch or finding a way to get out of detention. Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""entire life will be filled with misery and pain""), despair (""Fuck life, I'm out""), anhedonia (""not motivated to do anything""), and feelings of being a burden or unwanted (""I feel unwanted,"" ""I'll never receive the attention or commitment""). 
   - There is an explicit mention of suicide: ""Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit."" This indicates the author is experiencing suicidal thoughts, but it is framed as an unfixable problem or intrusive thought rather than a current desire to act. 
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions) are present. 
   - The temporal context is current feelings and thoughts, with no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") indicated. 
   - The writer's stated desire regarding suicide is ambiguous: the thought of suicide is presented as a distressing, unsolvable issue, but there is no explicit expression of a wish to die or to act on these thoughts (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). Instead, the tone suggests distress about having these thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""the thought of suicide""). 
   - However, it does not express a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide. The phrase ""the thought of suicide"" focuses on the presence of the idea, not an intent to act, and the context emphasizes helplessness (""You can't fix that shit"") rather than a genuine wish to die. 
   - The writer does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., ""I don't want these thoughts""), but the overall sentiment is one of distress about their situation, including the suicidal thoughts. This leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary issue is emotional turmoil, not active suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. The reference to suicide remains at the level of a thought or idea.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional and cognitive states (e.g., feelings of hopelessness, suicidal thoughts). There is no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""the thought of suicide""), which initially suggests 'Ideation'. However, there is no clear expression of a desire to die or act on these thoughts, and the context frames the thoughts as part of broader distress. 
   - Without a stated desire to die, and given the ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent (e.g., the thoughts are presented as an unfixable burden), the category should default to 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" 
   - There is no evidence for 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no initiated actions).

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people. The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post describes past feelings of depression, loneliness, anxiety, and hopelessness during lockdown in Denmark. It mentions thoughts about not being in the world (""what if I wasn't in this world"") and gaining peace, which relates to suicidal ideation. However, the writer explicitly states these thoughts were scary and that they were ""on the verge of becoming suicidal"" but never intended to act on them (""Never really thought I would act it out""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""never done what I set out to do""), despair (e.g., ""never really connected with people""), and anhedonia (e.g., ""depressed, bored""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The writer concludes with a positive message about life's beauty and recommends a book for others with suicidal thoughts, indicating a current perspective of hope and resilience.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post indirectly references suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world"") and uses the phrase ""on the verge of becoming suicidal,"" but it does not include a direct, personal expression of a current desire to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""). Crucially, the writer negates any genuine desire to act, stating the thoughts ""scared me"" and they ""never really thought I would act it out."" This frames the suicidal thoughts as unwanted and distressing, not as a current personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The discussion is solely about thoughts and feelings, with no indication of concrete steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past events during lockdown, with no reference to current intentions. It recounts historical thoughts but explicitly denies any action (""Never really thought I would act it out""). There is no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt), only the experience of ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content expresses general distress and abstract suicidal thoughts but lacks a clear, current personal desire to die, as the thoughts are explicitly stated as unwanted and frightening. The writer's focus is on past emotional struggle and a current message of hope, aligning with 'Indicator' (distress about suicidal thoughts without personal desire). It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit, current expression of a wish to die; the historical ideation is downplayed and negated. There is no plan/method for 'Behavior' and no described action for 'Attempt'.

349,I think i'm gonna try to end myself again tonight. 15m. Hi. I think i'm going to try and end it tonight again. Probably by trying to overdose. I'm sorry. I'm just really depressed and sad atm and idk what to do. I have been crying basically all night and now this morning.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end myself"" and ""end it"" (direct suicide references) and ""overdose"" as a specific method.  
   - Emotional indicators include depression, sadness, crying, and helplessness (""idk what to do"").  
   - A specific method (""overdose"") and timeframe (""tonight"") are stated. The phrase ""again tonight"" implies recurring intent but no description of a past *initiated action*.  
   - The desire to die is explicit (""I think I'm gonna try to end myself""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. The author personally desires death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A specific method (""overdose"") and imminent timing (""tonight"") are mentioned. No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the method is concrete and actionable.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post focuses on a *future* intention (""tonight""). The word ""again"" hints at past ideation/behavior but does **not** describe a past *initiated, potentially lethal action* (e.g., ""I tried to overdose last week""). Thus, no *attempt* is indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die + specific method/plan (""overdose tonight"") qualifies as **Behavior**.  
   - No past/current *initiated action* (e.g., ""I took pills"") moves this out of 'Attempt'.  
   - The method is unambiguous, so 'Behavior' overrides 'Ideation'.

I know I'm at the end. I can't fight anymore, I can't try anymore. When you're so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders, that's how I feel with life and its pain. For anyone who has read this, thank you. Even if just one person reads this, it means a lot to me that you did. Some people just aren't meant for this world, and that's okay. My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes mentions of death/dying (e.g., ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" ""My death will release my pain"") and strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""I can't fight anymore,"" ""so tired,"" ""life and its pain""). It also expresses a sense of being a burden or not meant for the world (""Some people just aren't meant for this world"").
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The reference to ""the next month or two"" indicates a timeframe but not an immediate plan or action.
   - No past actions, such as initiated suicide attempts, are described.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire for death as a release from pain (e.g., ""My death will release my pain""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it contains direct expressions of a personal desire to die (e.g., ""My death will release my pain,"" ""I know I'm at the end""). These phrases, in the context of despair, indicate a clear wish to not be alive.
   - There is no statement negating or expressing distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts; instead, the tone is resigned and accepting of death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The cat metaphor (""like when a cat knows they're dying and they go into some dark corner to die"") is vague and metaphorical, not an explicit plan or method for suicide. The timeframe (""next month or two"") is general and not tied to concrete actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future-oriented feelings of inevitability (""in the next month or two"") but describes no past or recent initiated actions. It centers on current emotional state and anticipation, not behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die, fitting the core of 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method). The lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. While the post shows distress, the personal desire for death moves it beyond 'Indicator', which requires absence of such desire or explicit unwanted thoughts. Ambiguity about the cat metaphor does not rise to the level of a plan, so 'Ideation' is appropriate.

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds .

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions imminent suicidal action: ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" ""I'm ready to do it,"" and specifies methods (""knife and some pills"").  
   - Strong emotional indicators: ""hit rock bottom,"" ""feel like a complete failure,"" ""overwhelming,"" ""suicide is on my mind.""  
   - Specific plan/method: Locking self in bathroom with a knife and pills at 6 AM (imminent timing).  
   - Preparation: Explicitly states readiness (""ready to do it"") and contextualizes the act.  
   - Desire conflict: Expresses not wanting to cause pain (""I don't want to do this"") but emphasizes intent due to feeling trapped (""run out of options"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" and ""I'm ready to do it."" The desire to die is clear and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (knife and pills) and location (bathroom) are mentioned, with imminent timing (""currently 6 in the morning,"" ""about to"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *future intention* (""about to lock myself,"" ""ready to do it"") but **no past/initiated action**. The focus is on impending behavior, not a completed/attempted act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"")—rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Conflict (""I don’t want to do this"") is secondary to stated intent and concrete plan, so not 'Indicator'.

I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day,"" indicating persistent suicidal ideation and frequent consideration of methods.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no interest in modern life,"" ""each year has got worse,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"") and distress (""what's really worrying"").
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is detailed; ""method"" is referenced vaguely without elaboration.
   - No references to past actions or attempts (e.g., no description of initiating self-harm).
   - No imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"" for acting on thoughts).
   - The writer expresses suicidal thoughts but does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not desire to die; the tone suggests ongoing distress rather than a clear rejection of suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" indicating a personal expression of suicidal ideation.
   - The desire to die is implied through the constant thoughts and contemplation, with no explicit negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die"").
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' due to the clear personal suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The phrase ""contemplate method"" suggests thinking about methods, but no specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - Without explicit details of a plan or preparation, this remains in the realm of ideation. The rules state to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan/method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current, ongoing thoughts (""constantly,"" ""over 100 times a day"") with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of trying and failing or being interrupted), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit personal suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (implied by constant ideation and method contemplation), placing it above 'Indicator'.
   - However, the lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (e.g., ""contemplate method"" is general and not actionable).
   - 'Attempt' is inapplicable as no concrete past or recent actions are described.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the desire to die with thoughts of suicide but without a plan or behavior.

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains strong emotional indicators of distress, including hopelessness (""I feel so trapped,"" ""I know no one can save me""), despair (""I'm at my rope's end,"" ""I hate it so much""), and feelings of being a burden (e.g., family dynamics where the author's needs are dismissed). 
   - There is an explicit statement of suicidal desire: ""I jsut want to die."" 
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts (e.g., no descriptions of initiated self-harm). 
   - The temporal context focuses on current emotional suffering and past traumas, with no imminent timeline for acting on suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die with the phrase ""I jsut want to die."" This is a clear statement of wanting not to be alive, in the context of despair. 
   - There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to die""). Thus, this is not merely distress about unwanted thoughts, but a genuine expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The post describes emotional pain and life circumstances but lacks any concrete details about how the author might act on suicidal thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past traumas (e.g., sexual assault, family neglect) and current feelings, but it does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions that were initiated (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). The phrase ""I jsut want to die"" refers to a present desire, not an action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of an explicit, personal desire to die (""I jsut want to die"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any mention of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die or not be alive, but without any specific plan or preparatory elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of worthlessness (""fuck up,"" ""stupid human being"") and despair. Crucially, it explicitly mentions a suicidal method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") and context (""sitting in my car right now""). The writer also expresses ambivalence about seeking help due to fear of institutionalization. There is no description of a past or ongoing suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried to drive into a tree""), only current thoughts and planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: No direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Desire to die: The statement ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" implies a clear desire to die via a lethal method.  
   - Unwanted thoughts? The writer expresses distress about the thoughts but does *not* negate the desire (e.g., ""I don’t actually want to die""). Instead, they focus on fear of consequences for seeking help.  
   → **Suicidal intent is present**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a concrete, potentially lethal method.  
   - Preparation: ""sitting in my car right now"" implies immediate access to means (vehicle) and situational readiness.  
   - No explicit preparation (e.g., ""wrote a note""), but method + context indicate planning.  
   → **Plan/method is clearly stated**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a *current* intention (""thinking of,"" ""right now"").  
   - No past/ongoing action: No mention of initiating the act (e.g., ""I started driving fast but stopped"").  
   → **No attempt described; focus is on ideation with a plan**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator?** No. Suicidal desire and method are explicit.  
   - **Ideation?** No. While desire is present, the specific method (""driving into a tree"") and situational context (""in my car"") elevate it beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Behavior?** Yes. Method is specified, and context implies imminent capability.  
   - **Attempt?** No. No initiated action (e.g., ""I drove toward the tree"").  
   → **Classification: Behavior** (suicidal thoughts + specific plan/method).

   - Expresses hopelessness (""I don't see any future ahead for me""), self-hatred (""I hate myself so much""), and despair.  
   - Explicitly references personal suicidal intent (""I will be joining her [mum] as well,"" ""pain I will cause with my passing"").  
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or active preparations mentioned for suicide.  
   - Past hospitalization indicates a concrete prior attempt, but the post focuses on **current/future** intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""I will be joining her as well"" and ""pain I will cause with my passing"" directly express a personal desire to die by suicide. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal desire is explicit, there is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, gun), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The statement is generalized (""joining her"") without actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past suicide attempt is acknowledged (hospitalization), but the post emphasizes **future intent** (""once my mum passes I will be joining her"").  
   - No description of a recent or imminent *initiated action* (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (rules out *Indicator*).  
   - No plan/method/preparation mentioned (rules out *Behavior*).  
   - Past attempt is noted but the primary focus is current/future suicidal thoughts without active steps, so *Ideation* takes precedence over *Attempt* (which requires a described past/recent *action*).

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I feel so weak, so hopeless""), exhaustion (""tired of living""), and perceived failure (""losing"" a mental battle).  
   - Mentions persistent unwanted thoughts/dreams about a breakup but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods**.  
   - Key phrase: ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it."" This implies urgency to end suffering but **does not specify suicide or a lethal action**.  
   - Describes efforts to cope (therapy, medication, hobbies) and distress about their ineffectiveness.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - ""I have to stop it"" suggests a desire to end pain but **lacks a clear expression of wanting to die**. The phrase is ambiguous and could refer to stopping thoughts/suffering.  
   - **No stated desire for death**; focus is on emotional agony and exhaustion.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of plans, tools, locations, notes, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses ongoing distress over 6 months and recent dreams.  
   - **No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""tried to overdose"" or similar).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **no explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, or action**.  
   - Vague phrases like ""stop it"" and ""not much time left"" are concerning but ambiguous; they lack specificity about suicide and could reflect a desire to end emotional pain rather than life.  
   - Falls under **'Indicator'** due to:  
     - Abstract distress without personal suicidal intent.  
     - Absence of suicidal ideation/plan/behavior descriptors.  
     - Rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator.""

I used to love making shit. I used to love trying and experimenting and wasting time because it wasn't a waste to me. But capitalism and instant gratification has irreparably fucked up my brain. I don't want to anymore. It wasn't supposed to happen to me but it did. I don't know where I want to go and what future I may or may not have. I don't know anything anymore. I hope I'll get out of this soon. But maybe I won't. And that's life too. Is it alright to work a corporate job you're content with and live a mediocre existence? All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide and be depressed. Would've been better for me to not be here at all.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""be depressed,"" indicating suicidal thoughts and emotional distress. It expresses hopelessness (""I don't know where I want to go,"" ""I don't know anything anymore""), anhedonia (loss of interest in activities like art), and a sense of burden (""All my ancestors died for me to constantly contemplate suicide""). Phrases like ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all"" suggest a passive desire not to exist. However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The writer also expresses a hope to ""get out of this soon,"" showing some ambivalence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""contemplate suicide,"" which is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts. It also implies a desire to not be alive through ""not be here at all,"" but this is passive and not stated as an immediate intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so the suicidal thoughts represent a current personal expression.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., when or how), or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The focus is on contemplation and emotional distress without concrete suicidal planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing contemplation of suicide (""constantly contemplate"") and past general struggles (e.g., art attempts), but no description of any initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action. The phrase ""tried making some art"" refers to a non-suicidal activity, not a suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""contemplate suicide"" and the implied desire to not exist (""not be here at all"") constitute a personal expression of suicidal thoughts, aligning with 'Ideation'. There is no plan, method, or preparation to elevate it to 'Behavior', and no description of a past or recent suicidal action for 'Attempt'. While the post shows distress and hopelessness, the explicit suicidal thoughts make it more than just an 'Indicator' (which would require the thoughts to be clearly unwanted or abstract). The absence of any resistance to the thoughts or desire to die supports 'Ideation'.

To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
    - The post mentions ""suicide"" directly and questions if it is ""better"" as a ""release.""  
    - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""life is a bust""), anhedonia, isolation (""no friends""), and trauma.  
    - No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes) are described.  
    - No past suicidal actions (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took pills"") are mentioned.  
    - The writer asks others if they feel ""the release is better,"" framing suicide as a theoretical question rather than stating a personal intent to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **Yes**, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and frames it as a potential solution (""release"").  
    - However, the desire is expressed as a philosophical question (""when to know if suicide is better"") and seeks validation from others. The writer does not state a current, personal commitment to act (e.g., ""I will do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **No** specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - The post discusses ongoing suffering and a hypothetical consideration of suicide. There is **no** description of past/current actions (e.g., attempts, preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - The writer expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""suicide is better,"" ""release"") and personal despair, ruling out 'Indicator'.  
    - No plan/method/preparation is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
    - No past/recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
    - The core content is a desire to die (""release"") without actionable steps, fitting 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions specific medications (Seroquel 100mg, Viepax 150mg/75mg) and quantities (58 pills each), tied to the statement ""I wanna go sleep forever.""
   - Expresses emotional despair: ""can't take this shit no more,"" ""sick and tired of my shitty life.""
   - Explicitly states a desire to ""sleep forever"" (a euphemism for death).
   - No past actions described (e.g., no mention of taking pills or prior attempts).
   - No temporal marker (e.g., ""tonight"") indicating immediacy, but the possession of pills implies current capability.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: ""I wanna go sleep forever"" is a clear expression of a desire to die (not merely unwanted thoughts). The phrase ""can't take this shit no more"" reinforces active distress and intent to escape life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes**: Specific method (overdosing) is strongly implied by listing exact quantities and types of pills (""58 pcs of 100 mg seroquel,"" etc.) alongside the desire to ""sleep forever."" Possession of these means constitutes preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current intent and possession of means but **no initiated action** (e.g., no statement about taking pills or a recent attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/means (pills) = **Behavior**. The detailed inventory of pills shows planning/preparation. No past/failed action rules out ""Attempt.""

It hurts.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive"") and strong emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness about a ""loveless marriage with no way out,"" depression, misery, feeling like a burden). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). No past or recent suicidal actions are described, and there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The desire to die is stated as a current, personal feeling without any negation (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive"") in a context of despair. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them. Therefore, suicidal intent is present, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses solely on emotional state and life circumstances without any planning elements. This absence means the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and circumstances but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to initiated attempts, such as taking pills or being interrupted). It expresses a desire to die but no concrete action has been taken, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") indicates personal suicidal thoughts, placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire). The lack of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. With no described actions, it cannot be 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', defined as explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, without a specific plan or method.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions past suicide attempts: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work,"" indicating initiated actions that were potentially lethal but not completed.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to bail out anymore""), self-hatred (""I hate myself so much""), and conflict (""I want this to end but I am scared"").
   - Current suicidal elements: ""I have a rope"" (method and preparation) and consideration of a location (""There's a building but I don't want to traumatize anyone""), showing planning aspects.
   - Desire to die is explicit: ""I have to do it,"" ""I should've done it a long time ago,"" and ""I want this to end"" (in context of ending life).
   - Imminence is suggested (""I have to do it"") but not specified with a timeframe.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use exact phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through references to past actions and statements like ""I have to do it"" and ""I want this to end"" in a suicidal context. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, there is a clear desire to act despite fear.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""I have a rope""), and a location is considered (""There's a building""), which indicates planning and preparation. However, this is current/future-oriented and not yet acted upon.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past concrete, potentially lethal actions: ""tried with a knife"" and ""tried and bailed out multiple times,"" which are self-initiated suicide attempts that failed or were stopped.
   - Current elements include having a rope and expressing intent (""I have to do it""), but no new action has been initiated beyond past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The past actions described (""tried with a knife"") meet the definition of an 'Attempt' as they are specific, self-initiated, and potentially lethal.
   - Although there are current indicators of 'Behavior' (e.g., having a rope and considering a location), the rules state that 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past concrete attempt is clearly described, even if current ideation or behavior is present.
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit personal desire to die and past actions. It is not 'Ideation' because there is evidence of a plan and preparation beyond thoughts. It is not solely 'Behavior' because the focus on past lethal actions elevates it to 'Attempt'.

A fly is worth more than i am. all they do is look for food and reproduce, i cant even do that. im useless.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post includes emotional indicators of hopelessness (""No point to anything in life with depression""), despair (""I feel pain""), and extreme worthlessness (""I'm useless,"" ""a fly is worth more than I am""). 
   - There is a mention of suicidal intent with the phrase ""i just want to end it,"" which implies a desire to end one's life, commonly interpreted as suicidal.
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts (e.g., trying something but failing).
   - No temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die through ""i just want to end it,"" with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a strong, commonly understood euphemism for suicide in a context of despair.
   - It expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive, as evidenced by ""i just want to end it"" combined with feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness.
   - There is no explicit negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on this""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, hanging), tools, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is vague and lacks detail about how it would be carried out.
   - Without any explicit plan, method, or preparation, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (e.g., ""I feel pain and i just want to end it"") with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key element is the explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""i just want to end it""), which falls under 'Ideation' as defined. 
   - The emotional distress and worthlessness support suicidal ideation but do not include a plan or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. 
   - Since there is no ambiguity about the personal desire to die (e.g., it is not stated as unwanted), 'Indicator' is not appropriate. 
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' is excluded.
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation'.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: 
     - Mentions of death/dying: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" implies a wish to not be alive.
     - Emotional indicators: ""that'll probably get me depressed enough,"" ""tired of being alone"" show hopelessness and despair.
     - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No explicit current plan, method, or preparation mentioned. ""attempt properly again"" refers to a past attempt and a vague future intention, but no details on method (e.g., tools, location) or current preparations.
     - References to past actions: ""attempt properly again"" clearly indicates a past suicide attempt by the author, implying an action was initiated.
     - Imminence: ""tomorrow"" is near-term for the wish, but the future attempt is conditional (""Christmas probably won't be happening this year""), not immediate.
     - Stated desire: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a genuine desire to die, not framed as unwanted thoughts. The reference to past and potential future attempts reinforces suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide/death: No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""won't wake up"" is a common euphemism for death, and ""attempt properly again"" explicitly references suicide.
   - Clear desire to die: Yes, ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" shows a current wish to die, and the context lacks any negation (e.g., no statement that thoughts are unwanted).
   - Conclusion: Explicit suicidal intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method mentioned: None (e.g., no tools, substances, locations).
   - Signs of preparation: None (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means).
   - Current plan: The phrase ""to attempt properly again"" suggests future intent but is vague and conditional, with no actionable details. This does not constitute a current plan/method.
   - Conclusion: No evidence of current plan, method, or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past event: ""attempt properly again"" describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (a suicide attempt). The word ""attempt"" confirms an action was taken, even if it failed or was incomplete (""properly"" implies it wasn't successful).
   - Current/future intention: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" is current ideation, and ""to attempt properly again"" is future-oriented but not an initiated action.
   - Key assessment: The past attempt is concrete and described, taking precedence over current ideation/future intent per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal desire (e.g., ""won't wake up""), which rules out 'Indicator'.
   - No current plan/method/preparation, so not 'Behavior'.
   - The description of a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") qualifies for 'Attempt', as it was a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. Even with current ideation, the rules state that if a past attempt is clearly described, 'Attempt' takes precedence.
   - Merely thinking about a past attempt would be 'Ideation', but here ""attempt"" implies action was taken.
   - Final category: 'Attempt' based on the past action reference.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly mentions seeking someone to kill the author (""looking for someone to kill me"") and references methods (""chop me up,"" harvesting organs). 
    - It expresses a desire to die (""kill me,"" ""i never get found again"") and includes preparation elements (hiding the body to avoid discovery). 
    - No past actions are described; the focus is on future intentions. 
    - The author's desire to die is unambiguous and active (e.g., ""happy for u to chop me up"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill me"" and ""chop me up"" confirm a clear desire to die. No negation or distress about unwanted thoughts is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **Yes**: Specific methods (killing, chopping up, organ harvesting) and preparations (hiding the body) are explicitly stated. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes a future intention (""looking for someone"") with planning/preparation. No past or recent initiated lethal actions are mentioned. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The author expresses a desire to die (**Ideation** criterion) but adds a specific plan/method (hiring someone, dismemberment) and preparation (concealing the body). This meets the **Behavior** threshold. No concrete past/initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"") exists to qualify as **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" indicating explicit references to suicide. Emotional indicators include ""fed up,"" ""none of it matters,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" and frustration with the ongoing struggle. However, there is no mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The user emphasizes fighting these thoughts and states, ""I have no desire to die,"" framing the suicidal thoughts as unwanted. The context is a long-term (10-year) battle with no indication of imminent action (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") or past actions beyond resisting thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death."" However, the writer clearly negates any desire to act, stating, ""I have no desire to die,"" and describes fighting to suppress the thoughts. This positions the suicidal content as distressing but unwanted, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The references to ""fantasizing"" and ""consider it"" are vague and lack concrete details about how suicide might be carried out. Without any explicit planning element, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses an ongoing, 10-year struggle with suicidal thoughts but no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, even if interrupted or failed). The phrase ""I consider it"" refers to consideration of suicide, not an action, and the statement ""I'm still here"" implies no lethal behavior has occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but explicitly states no desire to die, aligning with 'Indicator' (general distress with suicide discussed abstractly or as unwanted thoughts). It does not show a current personal desire to die required for 'Ideation', lacks any plan/method for 'Behavior', and describes no past actions for 'Attempt'. The explicit negation of desire (""I have no desire to die"") resolves any ambiguity in favor of 'Indicator'.

   - The post explicitly mentions ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Strong emotional distress is present (hopelessness, feeling unimportant, envy, depression).  
   - The writer states they ""can't harm myself even in the slightest"" and emphasizes inability to act.  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""wish to end my life"" and ""end all this"" express a clear personal desire to die.  
   - **No**: The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or separate from the self (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts""). The inability to act stems from self-described incapacity, not a rejection of the desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned. The focus is on the desire and emotional barriers (""I can’t harm myself"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes ongoing distress and current suicidal thoughts but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** (""wish to end my life""), ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is indicated, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of a past/current initiated lethal action**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is **suicidal desire without actionable plans**, fitting *Ideation*. The writer’s inability to self-harm does not negate the expressed intent.

367,I lost control. I've lost control of my head I just want to cry I can't breathe I want to scream help please I don't want to live this again,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress with phrases like ""lost control of my head,"" ""want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream,"" and a plea for help (""help please""). 
   - The key phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" suggests a desire to avoid recurring emotional pain or a situation, but it does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""lost control""), despair, and anxiety, but no explicit suicidal thoughts or desire to die. 
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, preparation, or reference to past suicidal actions. The phrase ""live this again"" implies a past experience of distress, but not a concrete suicidal act. 
   - No imminence of suicidal intent is indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). 
   - The writer's stated desire includes seeking help (""help please"") and avoiding a negative experience, but not a wish to die; the language focuses on distress about their current state.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. 
   - The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is ambiguous; it expresses a wish to escape a situation but not a clear desire to die or not be alive. It lacks suicidal intent and could be interpreted as a cry for relief from suffering. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, this does not apply. 
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicide/death intent, leaning strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, note-writing) is mentioned or implied. 
   - Without any suicidal desire established, this step reinforces that 'Behavior' is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings (""I lost control"" is present-tense) and references not wanting to ""live this again,"" which alludes to past distress but not a specific past action. 
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt). 
   - Conclusion: 'Attempt' is not relevant.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is vague and focused on avoiding emotional pain, not ending life. 
   - There is no evidence of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past actions. 
   - According to the rules, if there is ambiguity about suicidal desire or no explicit intent, 'Indicator' should be chosen. 
   - Thus, this fits 'Indicator': expressing distress without clear, current personal suicidal desire.

368,It's too hard. This is too hard I want to tell them everything not in writing but on the phone so they can hear the sincerity of my voice. My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and frustration about a ""sickness"" (likely a mental health struggle) and family dismissal.  
   - Key phrases: ""I want to tell them everything... so they can hear the sincerity of my voice,"" ""my reason to die,"" and critically, **""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it.""**  
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""it's horrible,"" ""I'm tired""), feeling unheard, and trauma.  
   - **Explicit suicidal element**: ""Decided this is it"" implies a resolved intention, and leaving a suicide note is a direct preparatory behavior.  
   - No explicit desire to live or rejection of suicidal thoughts. No mention of methods, timelines, or past actions beyond writing the note.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""My reason to die"" and ""decided this is it"" indicate a personal desire to end life. The note explicitly contextualizes this as a suicidal decision.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Writing a suicide note (""I left a note..."") is a documented preparatory step for suicide, aligning with the definition of **Behavior**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The note was written in the past (""left""), but no description of initiating a potentially lethal action (e.g., attempting overdose). The focus is on preparation (note) and current distress.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""reason to die,"" ""this is it"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The suicide note is a specific preparation, moving this to *Behavior*.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated lethal action (e.g., ""took pills,"" ""tried to hang myself"")—only preparation (note). Thus, *Behavior* is appropriate.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone. Every relationship I've ever had has fallen apart within a month. I can't keep doing this anymore. Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore. What's the point of life when you can't even carry your own weight? I just want to be normal. How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense despair, hopelessness (""I don't deserve anything,"" ""I blew it all""), self-loathing (""I'm a creep,"" ""unstable freak""), and perceived burdensomeness (""I don't want to be a burden anymore"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal desire** is stated: ""I just. Want. To die.""  
   - **Specific method inquiry**: ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" indicates active consideration of suicide methods and preparations (avoiding burdening parents).  
   - No past *actions* (e.g., attempts) are described—only enduring suicidal thoughts since middle school and current intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""I just. Want. To die."" The desire is personal and unequivocal, with no negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: The question ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body..."" explicitly references a method (though unspecified) and preparation (minimizing impact on parents). This shows active planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""How do I kill myself...""). References past ideation (""screamed I wanted to die"" in middle school) but **no described past/initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit desire to die and method inquiry rule this out.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: While ideation is present (""want to die""), the method/preparation question elevates it beyond passive thoughts.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **'Behavior'**: Suicidal desire + active consideration of method/preparation (body disposal) fits the definition.

I've done everything people told me to do, like moving out, working, talking to family more, getting a partner, therapy, and meds, but none of it made me truly happy. My view of the world is growing more and more dim and I'm really starting to question what the point of moving on is.

One last push is all I need and I'll be free from it all and I'm faced with the eternal void. No point in waiting for it to come naturally.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions hopelessness (""no point in it all,"" ""don't see a future,"" ""view of the world is dim""), despair (""trapped in limbo""), feeling like a burden (""disappointing those who care""). 
    - References to death/escape: ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" and rejecting waiting for natural death. 
    - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, goodbyes). 
    - Describes a *desire* for an endpoint (""one last push... I'll be free"") but no concrete plan or past action.  
    - Temporal context is future-oriented (""is all I need,"" ""I'll be free"") with no mention of initiated actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **Yes**. While no direct terms like ""suicide"" are used, phrases like ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" and ""eternal void"" strongly imply a desire to die. The rejection of waiting for natural death (""No point in waiting for it to come naturally"") reinforces active intent. The author expresses a *personal wish* for cessation, not just distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **No**. The phrase ""push me over the edge"" is metaphorical and vague. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Describes past efforts to improve life (therapy, meds) but **no past or recent suicidal actions**. All suicidal expressions are future-oriented (""I need,"" ""I'll be free"") without initiation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - **Ideation** fits best:  
        - Explicit desire to die/escape (""free from it all,"" ""eternal void"") is present, satisfying the threshold for *Ideation*.  
        - Absence of specific plans/methods/preparations rules out *Behavior*.  
        - No description of past/initiated actions rules out *Attempt*.  
        - The personal desire to die distinguishes this from *Indicator* (which requires absence of genuine suicidal intent).

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses suicide in a general, abstract context (""People who commit suicide are not weak"") and describes common reasons for reaching that point (e.g., bottling up emotions, dealing with pain alone, snapping/breaking down). 
   - There are no personal mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means by the author. 
   - Emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair are present but are generalized (""we've bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""snap and break down"") and not applied to the author personally. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the author are included. 
   - No imminence of intentions (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is stated. 
   - The writer does not express a personal desire to die; instead, the focus is on explaining others' experiences, with no indication of unwanted suicidal thoughts for themselves.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" but only in reference to other people, not the author (e.g., ""People who commit suicide""). 
   - There is no expression of a personal desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself""). 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not attributed to the author, so the question of unwanted thoughts doesn't apply. 
   - Since suicide is discussed abstractly without personal intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the author. 
   - The content remains general and descriptive, with no planning elements tied to the writer. 
   - Without a personal desire to die, this step doesn't shift the classification beyond 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a general, non-specific scenario about why people reach a suicidal point, with no reference to past, current, or future actions by the author. 
   - There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action by the author (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or failures). 
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and abstract discussion of suicide but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. 
   - It aligns with 'Indicator' because it focuses on explaining others' experiences and generalized emotional pain, not the author's own suicidal thoughts or plans. 
   - There is no ambiguity about personal desire (none is expressed), so 'Indicator' is appropriate over 'Ideation'. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not relevant due to the absence of personal plans or actions.

I dont owe anybody anything and if they have a problem with that too bad because I'd  be dead.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a desire to ""leave this world forever,"" indicating a clear personal wish to die. Emotional indicators include anger, resentment (""fuck everyone,"" ""I dont owe anybody shit""), and a sense of finality. There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or time frames (e.g., ""tonight""). The language is future-oriented and hypothetical (""if I kill myself,"" ""before I leave""), with no references to past actions or attempts. The desire to die appears genuine and not unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I just wanna leave... before I leave this world forever""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the author presents them as a defiant choice.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned. The ""giant middle finger"" is metaphorical for causing emotional impact, not a concrete step toward suicide. Without any plan or preparation details, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions (""if I kill myself,"" ""before I leave"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interventions, or failures). Everything is conditional or speculative, so there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, which rules out 'Indicator' (as there is clear suicidal intent, not just distress or unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation described, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal action is mentioned, so it is not an 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit suicidal desire without specific plans or actions.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time.

It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I am so tired of having to live,"" ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead""), despair (""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""I can't fucking function""), and anhedonia (inability to enjoy writing, reading, or self-care).  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"").  
   - No mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Death is framed as an inevitability due to dysfunction, not an active intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Dead"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to no longer be alive. The author does not frame this as an unwanted thought.

   - **No**: No references to tools, locations, substances, timelines, or preparatory acts (e.g., notes, acquiring means).

So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes a history of suicidal thoughts starting from age 10-11, with a specific past ideation (thinking about jumping into a lake to drown, but no action taken as the author was convinced not to).
   - Current emotional indicators include depression, faking daily activities, and persistent suicidal thoughts (""every hour... suicide by a train is on my mind"").
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present with a desire to die, as shown by phrases like ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" and ""planning on doing it.""
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""suicide by a train"" and ""put neck on the train tracks,"" with a future plan to act on the author's 18th birthday.
   - There are no signs of immediate preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note), but the post indicates planning for a future date.
   - The past event (at age 10-11) involves ideation and consideration of a method, but no initiated action—it was a thought that was stopped before any attempt.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented for the train method (""on my 18th birthday""), with no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""suicide by a train,"" expressing a clear personal desire to die. The author does not state these thoughts as unwanted; instead, they are actively planning an action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""suicide by a train"" and placing the neck on train tracks. This constitutes a plan element.
   - Preparation is implied through the stated intention to act on a specific future date (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday""), but no physical preparations are described.
   - The presence of a method and future plan moves this beyond mere ideation to 'Behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The past event (drowning thought at age 10-11) was not an initiated action—it was ideation that was stopped. No lethal action occurred.
   - The current content focuses on future intentions (train suicide planned for age 18), with no indication of a past or recent attempt (e.g., no description of initiating a lethal act that was interrupted or failed).
   - Therefore, this does not qualify as 'Attempt.'

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses explicit personal suicidal desire and thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator.'
   - The mention of a specific method (train) and a plan (future date) elevates this to 'Behavior,' as it includes planning elements beyond mere thoughts.
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - 'Behavior' is appropriate due to the combination of suicidal intent, a specific method, and a future plan.

I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but specifies they are ""behind me"" historically.  
   - Current thoughts are triggered by another person's attempt, making suicide feel more ""real"" and ""attainable.""  
   - Expresses distress about these recurring thoughts: ""I just don’t want to think like this anymore.""  
   - **No explicit personal desire to die** in the present. Instead, focuses on *unwanted* intrusive thoughts.  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or timeline** for self-harm.  
   - **No description of past personal actions** (only thoughts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but **explicitly frames them as unwanted** (""I don’t want to think like this anymore"").  
   - **No current personal desire to die expressed**; the focus is distress about intrusive thoughts.  
   - → Leans toward **Indicator**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, methods, locations, or preparations.  
   - Thoughts are abstract (""opens a window"") with no concrete planning.  
   - → Confirms exclusion from *Behavior* or *Attempt*.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - References **past thoughts only** (""had some suicidal thoughts,"" ""behind me"").  
   - Current state: **unwanted intrusive thoughts**, not actionable intent.  
   - **No past or recent self-initiated actions** described (only thoughts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Core issue: **Distress about intrusive suicidal thoughts without current desire to act**.  
   - Explicit negation of wanting these thoughts (""I don’t want to think like this"") aligns with **Indicator**.  
   - Lacks elements for *Ideation* (no current desire to die), *Behavior* (no plan/method), or *Attempt* (no concrete past action).  
   - Ambiguity resolved per rules: When doubt exists about genuine desire, default to **Indicator**.

377,"Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""intrusive thoughts,"" ""compulsions,"" ""rage outbursts,"" ""depressive episodes,"" and ends with ""just want my life to end."" 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and anhedonia (inability to function normally). 
   - There is an explicit expression of a desire for life to end (""just want my life to end""), but no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., attempts). 
   - No temporal context (e.g., ""tonight"") or imminence is indicated. The desire appears to be a current, general sentiment rather than a concrete plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""just want my life to end"" explicitly expresses a personal desire to not be alive, indicating suicidal intent. It is not framed as an unwanted or intrusive thought (e.g., no qualifier like ""but I don't want to""). 
   - While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are not used, ""want my life to end"" is a direct equivalent in a context of despair.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, gathering means) is mentioned. The focus is on thoughts and emotional distress, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current mental states and feelings, with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted or otherwise). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""just want my life to end"") qualifies this for 'Ideation' or higher. 
   - However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 
   - 'Indicator' is not appropriate because the author personally expresses a desire to die, rather than abstract distress or unwanted thoughts. The phrase ""just want my life to end"" shows genuine suicidal ideation without ambiguity about desire.

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past event: ""nearly killing myself one night"" – this describes a past action initiated by the author.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""disconnected from life,"" ""can't feel""), burden (""caused enough trouble for my parents""), and dissociation.  
   - Future risk: Hypothetical reference to methods (""step off a building or over a bridge"") but framed as a passive possibility (""without thinking""), not an active plan.  
   - No explicit current desire to die; focus is on dissociation and emotional numbness.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of past suicide attempt (""nearly killing myself""). No current statement like ""I want to die now.""  
   - Future reference (""it'll only take one day..."") implies vulnerability but not active intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Past: ""nearly killing myself"" confirms a prior concrete action (attempt).  
   - Future: ""step off a building or over a bridge"" specifies methods but lacks current preparations or timeline.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Key factor: ""nearly killing myself"" describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (interrupted or incomplete). This meets the 'Attempt' threshold.  
   - Future hypotheticals (""it'll only take one day..."") are passive and lack immediacy.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the suicide risk is the **past attempt** (""nearly killing myself""), which is a concrete, life-threatening action by the author.  
   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - Current dissociation/hopelessness is secondary; the explicit description of a past attempt takes precedence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feeling overwhelmed (""too much happening""), hopeless (""shits not worth it anymore""), and like a burden (""disappoint and burden other people"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""i want to take myself out.""  
   - Expresses fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") and seeks help (""what do i do, please?"").  
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeline, or past action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""i want to take myself out"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.  
   - The fear of pain shows ambivalence but does not negate the explicit wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/plan**: Phrases like ""take myself out"" are vague; no tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - ""i need a way out"" is metaphorical distress, not a concrete plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current distress and desire, not past actions.  
   - No description of initiated self-harm (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""take myself out"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned; fear of pain does not imply planning.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/current action described.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses a clear desire to die with suicidal intent but lacks any plan, method, or preparation.

380,Screw this. The more I live the more I want to die. Can't be fucked with anything anymore,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains the phrase ""I want to die,"" which is a direct expression of a desire to die. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and anhedonia are present in ""Can't be fucked with anything anymore,"" showing despair and loss of interest.
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions (e.g., previous attempts). The language is about current feelings, not imminent plans (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated and personal (""I want to die""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with ""I want to die,"" which is a clear personal statement of suicidal intent. There is no negation or indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), or preparations are mentioned. The focus is solely on the desire to die, not on how or when it might be carried out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (""the more I live the more I want to die""), with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an initiated attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior', as there is no indication of planning.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - This fits 'Ideation' perfectly: the author expresses a personal desire to die or have suicidal thoughts, but without specifics on how or when it would happen.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""contemplating"" (likely referring to suicidal thoughts), ""thinking on how to die painlessly,"" and explicit statements like ""I want to die."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm a burnout,"" ""I'm so tired of expectations""), despair (""they don't care,"" ""I'm lazy and useless""), and feeling like a burden (""they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay"").
   - There is no specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation described (e.g., the user states ""I have yet to find a way"" for painless death, indicating no plan is in place).
   - No references to past suicidal actions; the phrase ""I tried to tell them"" refers to communicating feelings, not an attempt.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""); the thoughts are ongoing for ""the past 6+ months.""
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""I want to die"") but with ambivalence due to fear of failure (""I'm scared of the consequences of failure""). The thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the desire is present but hindered by fear.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""thinking on how to die painlessly."" The word ""suicide"" isn't used, but the intent is clear and personal. The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; the fear relates to failure, not a rejection of the desire itself.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The user is actively thinking about methods (""thinking on how to die painlessly"") but explicitly states no way has been found (""I have yet to find a way""). There is no indication of tools, locations, or actions like writing a note or acquiring means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current and ongoing thoughts (""for the past 6+ months I have been thinking"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions. The fear of failure implies contemplation, not action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and personal suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator' (which would apply if suicidal intent were absent or thoughts were explicitly unwanted).
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (e.g., no mention of means like pills or a location).
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - This fits 'Ideation': clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no plan or preparatory behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, anger, and hopelessness (""hate everything,"" ""life is ruined,"" ""nothing to do""). Explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and references preparation (""emails to send to my parents before I do it""). Also notes prolonged suicidal ideation (""thought about killing myself for 5 years nonstop"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide/Death Intent**: Yes. Directly states ""killing myself"" and implies intent with ""before I do it."" No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act"").  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: Preparation is indicated (""emails to send... before I do it""), suggesting steps preceding an attempt. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.  
   - **Temporal Context & Action**: Describes ongoing ideation (5 years) and future-oriented preparation (""before I do it""). No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""killing myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While no specific method is named, the mention of preparatory actions (emails to parents) aligns with 'Behavior'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No description of initiated lethal actions (past or recent), so not 'Attempt'.  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal desire + preparation (emails) = **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""Ending it soon"" and expresses despair (""I'm so fucking depressed"").  
   - It describes specific stressors (fear of mom dying from virus, anti-LGBT environment, job loss, bad drug trip).  
   - **Crucially, it details a method and preparation**: ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan to overdose (""taking it all as soon as it gets here"").  
   - The timeline is future-focused (""soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here""), with no mention of past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Ending it soon"" directly implies suicidal intent. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (dextromethorphan overdose) and preparation (ordered, awaiting delivery).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **future intent** (""taking it all as soon as it gets here""). No initiated past/current actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit, ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - Specific method/preparation is present, ruling out *Ideation*.  
   - No description of an initiated action (only planning/preparation), ruling out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep dissatisfaction with life, hopelessness about the future (""it wasn't really good,"" ""60 fucking years left""), and philosophical questioning of life's purpose/value (""how people can want to live?"").  
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are present, but framed as existential frustration, not personal intent.  
   - No stated desire to die—only rhetorical challenges about the *concept* of living long.  
   - Imminence: No temporal markers (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") suggesting immediate risk.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - The author questions why others value life but **does not state a personal desire to die**. Frustration is directed at life's duration, not a wish for self-inflicted death.  
   - No references to suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on past life experiences (""I 'really lived' 15 years"") and future dread, but **no description of past/current self-harm actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress and hopelessness but **lacks personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Philosophical questioning of life's value falls under general distress (""Indicator"")—not ideation, as there is no explicit wish to die.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses a hypothetical scenario involving ""someone who's passive suicidal"" and the risk of ""suicide by cop"" if law enforcement is threatened. Key elements:
   - Mentions ""suicide by cop"" as a method, but this is attributed to a hypothetical third party (""someone""), not the author.
   - The author expresses frustration (""Why would people be so counterproductive?"") but shows no personal desire to die or engage in self-harm.
   - No emotional indicators of hopelessness or despair from the author. No references to personal plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.
   - The focus is on criticizing others' behavior, not expressing the author's own suicidal state.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by cop,"" but **not in reference to the author**. The author does not express a personal desire to die or commit suicide. Instead, they discuss risks abstractly (""someone who's passive suicidal""). Thus, **no explicit personal intent** is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (""suicide by cop"") is mentioned, but again, **attributed to a hypothetical person**, not the author. No personal plan, preparation, or method is described for the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a general warning/opinion, not a past or imminent action by the author. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are mentioned for the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author discusses suicide abstractly (""passive suicidal,"" ""suicide by cop"") to criticize others' actions, with **no personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior**. The tone is analytical/frustrated, not despairing. This fits **Indicator**, which covers abstract discussions of suicide or distress lacking personal intent. There is no evidence to support Ideation (no personal desire to die), Behavior (no personal plan/method), or Attempt (no described action).

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions a potential Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis and expresses depression, feeling like a burden (""I hate being a burden""), and hopelessness. It explicitly references suicidal intent through phrases like ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" and ""how to do it,"" which imply a personal desire to die using an insulin pump overdose method (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button""). Specific methods are discussed, including having ""a couple ideas"" and considering the pump as ""the easiest and most accessible"" way. Preparations are indicated by planning to get the pump if the condition worsens. Past events include ""almost went into shock"" accidentally (not intentional) and thinking about suicide ""a couple times"" but not acting due to hassle. No imminent timeframe is stated (e.g., ""tonight""); the plan is conditional on the diagnosis worsening. The desire to die is genuine and not framed as unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die through euphemisms like ""choose to go"" and ""do it"" in the context of suicide planning. There is no statement indicating these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no ""I don't want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator' and leans toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (insulin overdose via a pump) and preparations are discussed (planning to get the pump for this purpose, with ideas on accessibility). This indicates concrete planning elements, pushing the classification toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (using the pump if the condition worsens) and past thoughts (""thought about doing it""), but no concrete, initiated suicidal actions are described. The ""almost went into shock"" incident was accidental, not a self-initiated attempt. Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire, combined with a specific method (insulin pump overdose) and preparations (planning to acquire the means), aligns with 'Behavior'. While the plan is conditional, the mention of method and preparation meets the 'Behavior' criteria. Past suicidal thoughts without action and the accidental incident do not override the current behavioral indicators. There is no initiated lethal action for 'Attempt', and the detailed planning rules out 'Ideation' and 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and the author personalizes it with ""well I do,"" indicating a current desire for suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""tired of everything""), feeling ignored (""nobody told me happy birthday""), and despair (""Worst birthday ever""). There is no specific method, tool, location, or preparation described (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or plans). The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" suggests immediacy but lacks concrete details about how the suicide would be carried out. The author expresses a genuine wish to die, not unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and the author states ""I do"" in direct response, confirming a personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. ""I have a chance right now"" implies opportunity but does not describe a means, tool, location, or preparatory action. Without explicit details, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intention (""right now"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no reference to an actual attempt, interrupted or otherwise).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I do want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'. The lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. No past or recent suicidal actions are described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. This aligns with 'Ideation': explicit personal suicidal thoughts with desire but no plan or method.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""finally considering suicide"" explicitly.
   - Expresses intense distress (crying, stress, hopelessness), isolation, and feeling overwhelmed by academic pressure.
   - States suicidal thoughts are new (""finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year... I never thought about it"").
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines.
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions.
   - Protective factor noted (""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents""), but this does not negate the expressed suicidal ideation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly mentions ""considering suicide"" as a personal current thought. The phrase reflects a direct, personal acknowledgment of suicidal consideration, despite being contextualized by distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No** specific method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to suicide remains at the level of consideration/thought without actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes **current** suicidal thoughts (""finally considering suicide"") but no past or recent suicidal actions. The focus is on present emotional struggle, not initiated behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""considering suicide"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.
   - Lack of method, plan, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of initiated self-harm actions rules out **Attempt**.
   - While distress is central, the explicit, personal suicidal intent distinguishes this from **Indicator** (which requires absence of genuine desire/ideation). The protective factor (parents) does not negate the stated ideation.

Living life as a shell is bullshit but I cant even kill myself. I dont know if this is divine intervention or some shit but it hit me to the core. I was ready. I almost committed. What am I doing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""almost committed,"" indicating direct references to suicide and self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include despair (""shaking and bawling,"" ""worst feeling,"" ""Living life as a shell is bullshit"") and a stated desire to die (""I was ready to leave everything"").
   - Specific method: Use of a knife is implied (""my knife,"" ""My wrists and thighs are bleeding""), showing self-injury was initiated.
   - Preparations/actions: The writer describes being in the act (""right there about to do it"") with physical evidence of harm (bleeding wrists and thighs), and the action was interrupted by themselves (""I put down my knife"").
   - Temporal context: The event is recent (""just attempted""), and the description focuses on a past action that was initiated but not completed.
   - Desire: The writer expresses a clear wish to die (e.g., ""I was ready to leave everything"") but frustration at not completing the act, indicating the suicidal intent was genuine at the time.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""almost committed.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""I was ready to leave everything"").
   - The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the writer desired to act but was unable to, so this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (knife) is mentioned, and there are signs of preparation/action (bleeding from self-inflicted wounds, holding the knife).
   - This indicates concrete behavior beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a very recent, specific, self-initiated action: cutting wrists and thighs with a knife, which is potentially lethal.
   - The action was interrupted by the writer themselves (""I put down my knife""), making it a failed or aborted attempt, but it was still initiated and physically harmful.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content goes beyond 'Indicator' (no clear desire) or 'Ideation' (desire without action). It includes both desire and a method, but the key is the description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.
   - This matches the 'Attempt' category: a past or recent self-initiated, concrete action that was potentially lethal, even if stopped or failed. The mention of bleeding confirms physical initiation, and the writer's own words (""I just attempted"") directly state an attempt.
   - 'Behavior' would apply if there was only planning without initiation, but here action was taken, so 'Attempt' takes precedence.

Final classification: 'attempt' based on the initiated, potentially lethal action described.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts, such as ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't,"" and ""I feel like killing myself"" when interacting with parents. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., ""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it,"" ""I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live""). There are no mentions of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The user explicitly denies any past attempts (""I've never actually attempted suicide"") and describes calling hotlines but hanging up, which indicates distress but not suicidal action. Imminence is not indicated, as the desire is general and not time-bound (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""despite wanting to"") but also an inability to act due to lack of ""guts,"" showing internal conflict without negating the desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""kill myself"" multiple times. It also expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""wanting to"" commit suicide, ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would""). Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or something the writer is resisting; instead, the desire is present but unacted upon due to fear or inability. This leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The user discusses suicidal desire and thoughts but provides no details on how they might act on them. Without any plan-related elements, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes past and ongoing feelings of suicidal desire but no concrete actions. The user explicitly states no attempts were made (""I've never actually attempted suicide""). References to calling hotlines were help-seeking behaviors that were aborted, not suicidal actions. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal suicidal act (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or similar), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die (e.g., ""wanting to"" commit suicide), which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear desire or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'. Since no past or recent suicidal actions are described (only thoughts and desires), 'Attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', as it centers on suicidal thoughts and desire without progression to planning or action.

391,"Last post. I'm ending my life tonight. I'll find a way. I'll stop being a coward finally. If anyone saw my last post it's a continuation. The school called and said I can be considered a truant but luckily I saw the voicemail first and deleted it. And just for anyone whose confused I can't do that class. My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left.

Kinda sad I never got to do anything. Not that I could've anyways.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""ending my life tonight,"" ""killing myself,"" ""slit my wrists with some scissors.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""What's the point?""), feeling trapped (""only escape""), self-blame (""coward"").
   - Plan/method: Specific method (""slit my wrists with scissors""), timing (""tonight,"" ""when everyone is going to bed""), and preparation (""written my suicide note and put it on my notes app"").
   - Imminence: Immediate timeframe (""tonight"").
   - Desire: Unambiguously expresses a wish to die (e.g., ""Killing myself is the only escape""), with no indication of reluctance or unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""ending my life tonight,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""slit my wrists"" are direct declarations of intent to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes: Specific method (""slit my wrists with some scissors"") and explicit preparation (""written my suicide note""). Timing (""tonight"") is also clear.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intent (""tonight"") with preparatory actions completed (writing the note). No past or ongoing lethal actions are described—only planning and imminent intent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and suicide planning are present.
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific method (wrist-cutting) and preparations (suicide note) exceed mere thoughts/desire.
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past or initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of starting or trying to cut wrists). The plan is future-oriented.
   - **Behavior**: Fits perfectly due to the combination of explicit suicidal desire, specific method, preparation (note), and imminent timeframe. The post details a plan to act, but no action has yet occurred.

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" which directly references suicide and indicates a personal desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration and anger (""snitched,"" ""what the fuck"") and a comparison to euthanasia, suggesting the author views suicide as a desired outcome, not unwanted.
   - There is a mention of a ""plan,"" but no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) is detailed. The context implies the plan was credible enough for family intervention, but the post does not specify what the plan entails.
   - No references to past actions are made; the focus is on the disclosure of the plan and the resulting monitoring. There is no description of an initiated suicidal action (e.g., taking pills, attempting self-harm).
   - No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight"") suggest imminence; the plan is discussed in the context of past disclosure.
   - The author's stated desire is genuine, as they express distress about being prevented from acting on their suicidal plan, equating it to being denied euthanasia.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the desire to die is clear from the euthanasia comparison, and there is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted by the author.
   - This leans away from 'Indicator' due to the explicit personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post briefly mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" indicating a plan exists, but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is described.
   - While the word ""plan"" implies some level of intent, the lack of detail means it is not explicit about method or preparation. However, the brief mention of a plan aligns with the 'Behavior' category definition, which includes any reference to a plan, even if not detailed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past disclosure of the plan and current monitoring, but no concrete, initiated action by the author (e.g., an actual attempt) is mentioned. The focus is on the plan itself and the consequences of its disclosure.
   - Since no potentially lethal action was taken or initiated, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die (""kill myself"") and mentions a plan, moving this beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks explicit suicidal desire) or 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).
   - The brief mention of a ""plan"" qualifies this for 'Behavior', as per the definition: ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide."" There is uncertainty due to the lack of method details, but the explicit reference to a plan tips it toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post combines suicidal desire with a stated plan.

393,Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""im gonna kill myself"" with a specific timeline (""3 weeks from now""). It describes a behavioral change (minimally interacting with everyone except children for 3 weeks) as a precursor to the suicide. There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or concrete preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). Emotional indicators include social withdrawal and concern for the child's safety (""I hope my baby ends up safe""), suggesting despair. The desire to die is personal and current, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted. The context is future-oriented, with no references to past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" indicating a clear, personal desire to die. There is no negation or expression of unwanted thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is not mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations). However, the post describes a plan with a defined timeline (""3 weeks from now"") and behavioral preparations (minimizing interactions for 3 weeks before the act). The isolation is framed as a direct step leading to suicide (""and then im gonna kill myself""), which constitutes a preparatory behavior. Since there is a clear plan involving timing and behavioral changes, this leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now"") with no mention of past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). Thus, it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'. The absence of any past action rules out 'Attempt'. Between 'Ideation' and 'Behavior', the post includes a specific plan (timeline and preparatory isolation) despite the lack of a method. Per the guidelines, any mention of a plan or preparation leans toward 'Behavior'. Although the method is unspecified, the defined timeframe and behavioral changes constitute a plan, making 'Behavior' more appropriate than 'Ideation'. If unsure, 'Ideation' would be chosen, but the explicit plan here is sufficient for 'Behavior'.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" and ""Water bottle full of alcohol,"" which are potential methods for suicide via overdose.
   - The phrase ""Would this kill me"" indicates a focus on death and lethality, but it is framed as a question rather than a statement of intent. There are no explicit emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) or mentions of suicide, self-harm, or dying.
   - No specific plans, preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or temporal elements (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") are mentioned. The post is hypothetical, inquiring about the outcome of combining these substances.
   - There is no reference to past actions or attempts. The content is speculative, with no indication that any action has been initiated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - It does not express a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"")—instead, it poses a question about lethality. There is no statement indicating that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods (overdose using pills and alcohol) are implied through the list of substances, but they are presented in the context of a question (""Would this kill me"") rather than as part of a stated plan or preparation. The post does not describe any steps taken toward carrying out an act (e.g., ""I will take these"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post is in the present tense and hypothetical, with no description of past or recent actions. Nothing indicates that a concrete, potentially lethal action has been initiated, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses thoughts about death and includes specific means, but it lacks an explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide. The question format (""Would this kill me"") introduces ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent.
   - Given the ambiguity between 'Indicator' (general distress or abstract discussion of death without personal desire) and 'Ideation' (explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts), the rule states to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt.
   - The mention of methods is not tied to a plan or preparation, so it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. No action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

Conclusion: The post best fits the 'Indicator' category, as it discusses death abstractly through a question about lethality with listed means, but without a clear, current expression of the author's desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""end it,"" indicating a direct reference to death or self-harm. 
   - Emotional indicators include concern for loved ones' mental health, but the primary sentiment is a desire to die without causing distress to others (e.g., ""I'll get what I want"" implies a wish for death).
   - Specific methods are discussed: ""doing it in a way that doesn't look like suicide. Like a car accident or something."" This shows a plan to use a method (staging an accident) to achieve suicide.
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on current thoughts and planning (e.g., ""recently I've been thinking"").
   - No imminence is stated (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""), but the planning is current.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""end it,"" and the phrase ""I'll get what I want"" confirms a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""a car accident or something"" to disguise suicide. This constitutes a plan/method, even if not highly detailed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""planning,"" ""thinking""), with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is about ideation and planning, not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (suicidal thoughts) and includes a method (car accident), meeting the criteria for 'Behavior'. 
   - It is not 'Indicator' because there is an explicit personal desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts. 
   - It is not 'Ideation' because a plan/method is present. 
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent initiated action is described.

What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense feelings of hopelessness (""I'm a complete lost cause""), despair (""nothing I do can change it""), worthlessness (""I've never had any skills that are useful""), and being a burden (""I'm a constant burden on my sister""). It describes ongoing life struggles, such as failed job applications, unsuccessful attempts to pursue interests, and family conflicts. However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The emotional indicators are strong but do not include explicit suicidal desire. The references to past actions (e.g., job applications, driving lessons) relate to life failures, not suicidal behaviors. There is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") for self-harm. The writer's focus is on distress about their life situation, not a stated wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: No, the post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are absent). Instead, the writer emphasizes feelings of failure and burden without linking them to suicidal intent. Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, the question of whether they are unwanted is not applicable. This lack of explicit suicidal intent leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific suicide method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. The post discusses everyday challenges (e.g., driving lessons, job applications) that are unrelated to suicide planning. Without any expression of suicidal desire, this step is not relevant, but if it were, the absence of plan/method would further support 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'. However, since no desire is present, it reinforces 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes past events (e.g., failed job applications, driving lessons) but these are non-suicidal life experiences. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., self-harm or suicide attempt) in the past or present. The content focuses on chronic distress rather than concrete actions toward suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post falls under 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden without any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past suicidal action. The emotional content indicates severe psychological distress but lacks the key elements for 'Ideation' (e.g., ""I want to die""), 'Behavior' (e.g., a suicide plan), or 'Attempt' (e.g., a past lethal action). Following the rule, when there is ambiguity or no clear suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses emotional distress (""I feel like shit,"" ""depressed,"" ""fucking sad"") and loneliness (""to feel a little less alone,"" ""pretend I have a friend"").  
   - There are **no mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - The writer seeks connection/support (""talk to someone,"" ""vent,"" ""PM me"") to alleviate distress.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or desire to die.  
   - The focus is on coping with sadness/loneliness, not suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No references** to plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide/self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current emotional state** only. No past/current actions related to suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress and depression but **lacks explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**.  
   - The plea for social connection suggests distress management, not suicidal intent.  
   - Fits **Indicator** (general distress without suicidal desire/ideation).

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""wrote a note today"" – this is a preparation step.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""light has disappeared,"" ""end of my rope,"" ""can't keep going"").
   - References isolation, failed treatments, and despair (""inpatient treatment has done me more harm than good,"" ""outpatient treatment... leaves me with no results"").
   - States fear of death no longer deters them, implying suicidal thoughts are escalating.
   - Describes a recent ER visit due to distress but does not frame it as a suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong implied desire to die (""can't keep going,"" ""last chance at asking for help,"" fear of death no longer a deterrent). This leans toward **Ideation/Behavior**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Explicit preparation: ""wrote a note today"" (suicide note). This is a clear preparatory act, fitting **Behavior**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The ER visit was triggered by distress, not a self-initiated lethal action. No description of past/current suicide attempts. The note-writing is a current preparatory behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Preparation (note)** elevates it beyond general distress (Indicator) or passive desire (Ideation).
   - No specific method mentioned, but preparation alone qualifies as **Behavior**.
   - No initiated lethal action (e.g., ingestion/injury), so not Attempt.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end my life"" which directly refers to suicide.
   - The phrase ""tried didn't work"" and ""tried to end my life again"" indicates a past action was taken to commit suicide.
   - The repetition of ""didn't work"" confirms the action failed or was unsuccessful.
   - There is no mention of plans, methods, or preparations for a future act; the focus is on a past event.
   - No expressions of unwanted thoughts or abstract distress—this is a direct account of a concrete action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, ""end my life"" is an explicit statement of suicidal intent. The author personally expresses this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. However, the absence of these details does not negate the classification, as the focus is on the action taken.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to end my life again"" and ""didn't work."" The word ""tried"" confirms an initiated, potentially lethal action was taken (even if it failed). The phrase ""again"" further emphasizes a concrete past behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is a description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""tried to end my life"") that failed (""didn't work""). This aligns with the 'Attempt' definition (past/recent initiated action, regardless of outcome). 
   - There is no ambiguity: the author is not discussing thoughts, plans, or general distress but a specific past act. 
   - Rules precedence: 'Attempt' supersedes other categories when a concrete suicidal action is described, even without method details.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes a 17-year-old's prolonged struggle with unexplained physical symptoms (head fogginess, inflammation, pain) following a minor accident. They detail extensive but unsuccessful medical treatments (doctors, scans, CBD, Cymbalta, supplements). Key emotional indicators include: ""I feel hopeless,"" ""nothing has helped me,"" and ""I really don’t know what to do anymore."" No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide appear. The distress is explicitly linked to frustration over unresolved symptoms.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: **No**. The post contains no direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die/not be alive. Hopelessness is contextualized solely within the medical struggle, with no suicidal ideation expressed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: **None present**. No tools, locations, substances, preparations, or suicidal plans are mentioned. The focus remains on physical symptoms and failed treatments.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: **No relevant actions**. The post describes past medical appointments/treatments but no self-initiated potentially lethal acts (e.g., no references to overdosing, self-injury, or interrupted/failed suicide attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Hopelessness and despair are present but **lack any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Distress is attributed solely to physical suffering and failed treatments, falling under general emotional struggle.  
   - Meets **Indicator** criteria: expressions of hopelessness/distress without suicidal intent or ideation. Ambiguity rules also favor 'Indicator'.

I know I suck, everyone who cares to see it knows that I suck, I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat and leave my corpse there to rot.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post contains multiple expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve to be dead,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I wish someone would kick my door down and slit my fucking throat""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""there is no better, this is it""), worthlessness (""I'm a self-absorbed whiny piece of shit,"" ""I don't deserve to get better""), and feeling like a burden (""I've been a burden for too fucking long""). Specific methods are mentioned (bullet to the head, throat-slitting), but the author explicitly states ""I have no plans"" and doubts success (""I don't think I'd succeed anyway""). The desire for death is expressed through passive wishes (e.g., wanting someone else to cause death) rather than self-initiated action. No references to past actions, preparations, or imminent timing are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through phrases like ""I deserve to die"" and ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head."" Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, they are endorsed as deserved. The desire is clear and personal, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Methods are mentioned (bullet, throat-slitting), but they are not tied to a specific plan or preparation. The author explicitly denies having plans (""I have no plans"") and frames the methods as hypothetical or deserved outcomes. The passive nature of the wish (""I wish someone would..."") further indicates no self-initiated planning. With no evidence of preparation and an explicit denial of plans, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions. All references to death are hypothetical or wished for, not initiated. No actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die, satisfying the criteria for 'Ideation'. However, the denial of plans (""I have no plans"") and lack of preparation mean it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' (which requires explicit planning, method, or preparation). The mention of methods is contextualized as deserved outcomes, not active planning. Since the desire is explicit but unaccompanied by a plan, and the author negates intention to act, 'Ideation' is the best fit. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the explicit suicidal desire, and 'Attempt' is inapplicable with no described actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions death/dying: ""I will die alone,"" ""so am I"" (implying death after parents pass).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""what's the fucking point?""), despair (""sick of this emptiness""), feeling like a burden (""parents don't deserve to bury their child""), self-loathing (""hideous fucking mutant,"" ""fat retard,"" ""sad man"").
   - Desire to die: Explicit future intent (""the second they're gone, so am I"") and current obligation to stay alive (""only alive by obligation"").
   - No specific plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).
   - No reference to past actions/attempts.
   - Temporal context: Future-oriented (""when parents are gone""), not immediate/imminent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. ""so am I"" (after parents' death) implies a personal desire to die. The phrase ""I'm only alive by obligation"" reinforces active suicidal desire suppressed by external factors. No negation of the desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No. While intent is future-bound (""when parents are gone""), no method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No past/current actions described. Focus is on future intent without initiation of behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Explicit personal desire to die (""so am I"") and lack of negation (""I don’t want this"") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** Suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation is mentioned. The future timeframe (""when parents are gone"") is not a plan element (e.g., no *how* specified).  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No evidence of past/recent initiated lethal action.  
   - **Conclusion:** Fits *Ideation* (explicit desire to die, no plan/method).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""suicidal ones"" (urges) and self-destructive urges.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""don't know what to do""), guilt (""hate myself for thinking of killing myself""), and despair (""guilty downward spiral"").  
   - Explicitly states having ""a plan but no date set.""  
   - No specific method, tools, or preparations described (e.g., pills, note-writing).  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., attempts).  
   - Focuses on internal conflict due to guilt about potential impact on loved ones.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly references ""suicidal urges"" and ""killing myself.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a personal desire (""thinking of killing myself""), though conflicted due to guilt.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan mentioned**: Explicitly states ""I have a plan but no date set.""  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - **Conclusion**: Presence of a plan qualifies as 'Behavior' despite lack of method details.

   - Discusses current urges and thoughts (""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   - **No** description of past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""took pills"").  
   - Focus is on contemplating suicide, not acting on it.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** (Ideation threshold met).  
   - **Plan is explicitly stated** (""have a plan""), elevating it to 'Behavior' per rules.  
   - No ambiguity about plan existence; no past actions.  
   - Guilt/conflict doesn’t negate the presence of a plan.  
   - Rules: ""If a plan/method is present, consider 'Behavior'.""

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly, but frames them as something the author hides to avoid stress and maintain focus on other therapy issues. Emotional indicators include distress (e.g., ""therapy tough enough,"" ""a lot of stress""), hopelessness (""not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself""), and anhedonia (implied by avoidance). There is no mention of death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The focus is on the burden of disclosing thoughts and increasing frequency of thoughts, not on acting on them. The desire expressed is to avoid the consequences of admitting suicidal thoughts, not a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but does not express a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). Instead, the author states they lie about these thoughts to prevent stress and focus on other issues, indicating the thoughts are unwanted and not representative of a current intent to act. This aligns with 'Indicator' criteria.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned. The discussion is solely about concealing thoughts during therapy, with no reference to how or when suicide might be carried out. This absence rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a general pattern of concealment and increasing frequency of thoughts, but no past, current, or imminent suicidal actions (e.g., no attempts, interruptions, or failures). References to lying are about verbal deception in therapy, not a concrete suicidal act. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts without a personal desire to die, plan, or action. It fits 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed as a source of stress to be avoided, and the author shows no intent to act. Ambiguity exists due to the mention of suicidal thoughts, but the context of avoidance and lack of desire supports 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' (which requires explicit desire). Rules against 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' apply as there is no plan or action.

I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""nearly killing myself,"" which references a past suicidal action or crisis. It includes emotional indicators like ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away"" and ""I fucking hate living,"" expressing hopelessness, despair, and a current desire not to live. There is no mention of a specific current plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), or preparations for suicide. The phrase ""shooting up the school"" relates to past violent ideation but is not directly tied to a current or personal suicide method. The temporal context focuses on a past event (""bullied me into nearly killing myself"") and current feelings of distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""nearly killing myself,"" indicating a past personal suicidal intent. The current statement ""I fucking hate living"" expresses a present desire to not be alive, but it is not explicitly paired with a current intent to act on suicidal thoughts. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""shooting up the school"" in the past context may imply a method, but it is not clearly a suicide method and is part of the historical description. For current content, there is no indication of planning or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""nearly killing myself"" suggests a potentially lethal action that was initiated (e.g., an attempt that was stopped, interrupted, or not completed) due to bullying. This qualifies as a concrete past suicidal action under the 'Attempt' definition. Current expressions like ""I fucking hate living"" indicate ongoing ideation but no new action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The past event ""nearly killing myself"" describes an initiated, potentially lethal action (even if not completed), which fits the 'Attempt' category. Current expressions of hating life suggest ideation, but the clear description of a past attempt takes precedence per the rules. There is no current plan or behavior indicated, so 'Behavior' does not apply. 'Indicator' is inappropriate because there is explicit personal suicidal intent (past and current), and 'Ideation' is overruled by the past action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past overdose event: ""Survived OD,"" ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen,"" ""drank hard liquor,"" and ""held off going to the hospital."" 
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel stupid""), dissociation (""still feel weird""), and distress about recurring thoughts (""all these thoughts just pop up""). 
   - There is a clear desire expressed: ""I wanted to [die]"" and regret that their brain doesn’t recognize the lethality. 
   - The action was initiated and required hospitalization (though consent was unclear). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - Yes. A specific method is described (overdosing on ibuprofen + alcohol), and preparations are implied (procuring pills, delaying help). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a **past, concrete, potentially lethal action**: The author initiated an overdose, required hospitalization, and survived. This qualifies as an *initiated action* under the 'Attempt' definition. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is a detailed account of a past suicide attempt (OD). The author’s current processing (""still feel weird"") or lingering thoughts do not override the description of a concrete, life-threatening action they initiated. Per rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a past potentially lethal action is explicitly described.

I don't even hate myself at all anymore, but I still want to find a way to get away from it all. I'm so sick of every worthless person around me. I've told two people about my feelings and got fed the bullshit I expected to receive. One told me it goes away over time, which it didn't. The other one, now that I think of it, didn't tell me anything beyond his own experiences which weren't related to mine. Does anyone else feel the way I do? I have no issues with myself, but the world never fails to remind me how horrible it is. All words are meaningless. Every action is malicious. Suicide has become my quick solution.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of helplessness, being misunderstood, and paranoid delusions. The author explicitly states ""Suicide has become my quick solution,"" indicating a personal association with suicide as an escape. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""all words are meaningless,"" ""every action is malicious"") and frustration with others. There is **no mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions**. The phrase ""quick solution"" implies a conceptualization of suicide but lacks concrete details.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" as a personal solution.  
   - The statement ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" reflects a current desire to use suicide as an escape, framing it as a viable option.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - The reference to suicide remains abstract (""quick solution""), with no actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses current emotional states and ideation but **describes no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or outcomes like hospitalization).  
   - Mentions of telling others about feelings relate to distress, not suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit personal desire to die is present (""Suicide has become my quick solution""), ruling out 'Indicator'.  
   - Absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The core content aligns with **'Ideation'**: expressing a desire to die/suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.

408,"About depression. It makes it hard to keep going. Every day feels like the previous one, hearing the voice in death stranding ""*keep on keeping on. *"" over and over. It's even harder for friends or close people to understand how badly mangled (psychically) you are. Feels like only depressed people can understand each other, as a closed circle. It slowly lurks and creeps inside, viciously and silently, and never really goes away. I wonder if a long-term cure even exists.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post focuses on the experience of depression: difficulty continuing, repetitive daily struggles, feeling misunderstood by others, and the persistent, insidious nature of the condition. 
   - It references a metaphorical ""voice"" from a game (""*keep on keeping on*""), emphasizing endurance rather than death. 
   - Mentions feeling ""psychically mangled"" and hopeless about a long-term cure. 
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""never really goes away,"" ""wonder if a cure exists"") and isolation are present, but **no desire to die is expressed**. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit wishes to die. 
   - The phrase ""*keep on keeping on*"" implies a struggle to persist, contrasting with a desire to end life. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, so the ""unwanted thoughts"" clause doesn’t apply. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or preparations. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes ongoing depression, **no past or recent actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and isolation but **lacks any personal desire to die, suicidal intent, plans, or actions**. 
   - Falls under **Indicator** due to general distress about depression without explicit suicidal ideation. 
   - No ambiguity requiring fallback to ""Indicator"" – the absence of suicidal desire is clear.

I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions dad's suicide, feeling it's ""inevitable"" for them.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""reliving the same day,"" ""felt like shit for years"").  
   - Explicitly states: ""I get suicidal thoughts.""  
   - Qualifies intent: ""I'm probably too much of a pussy to ever do it"" (explicit negation of intent to act).  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions initiated by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""  
   - **But** explicitly negates desire/ability to act: ""too much of a pussy to ever do it."" This frames the thoughts as *unwanted/distressing* rather than a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - None mentioned. No tools, locations, preparations, or timelines indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and passive suicidal thoughts.  
   - No reference to past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took,"" ""attempted"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly *unwanted and not acted upon*.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No initiated action → rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The explicit negation of intent (""too much of a pussy to ever do it"") shifts this from *Ideation* (desire to die) to **Indicator** (distress about intrusive thoughts without genuine desire/plan).  
   - Ambiguity about desire resolved by negation → *Indicator* per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""i wanna off myself"" and discusses ambivalence (""i'm scared... i'll miss out on something"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i can't see it getting better""), despair (""i fucking hate it here""), and isolation (""i want attention... so someone knows how fucking shit i feel"").  
   - **No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines** are mentioned (e.g., ""hang"" is used metaphorically: ""hang onto that string of hope"").  
   - References to therapy discontinuation and depression diagnosis reflect distress but **no past/current suicidal actions**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""i wanna off myself"" and expresses a genuine (though conflicted) desire to die. The fear of missing out shows ambivalence but **does not negate the stated desire**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, tools, locations, or preparations** (e.g., pills, notes, timelines) are mentioned.  
   - ""Off myself"" is a general phrase; no specifics imply planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current feelings and abstract fears** about the future.  
   - **No description of past/initiated self-harm actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""wanna off myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.

As i'm writing this my mind is becoming more worse and the suicidal thoughts are like eating me up. There is no one that i can share my problems with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" multiple times, expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE""), and describes intense hopelessness (""I feel so hopeless,"" ""THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME""), self-hatred, and feeling trapped. There is no reference to specific suicide methods, tools, locations, preparations (like writing a note or acquiring means), or past actions. The temporal context is current distress, with no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer expresses ambivalence due to concern for parents (""I can't leave my parents too""), but the core sentiment is a personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die. The mention of not wanting to hurt parents shows conflict but does not negate the expressed desire; it is not framed as unwanted thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want these thoughts"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. The focus is on thoughts and emotions, not concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, even interrupted ones). All content is forward-looking or hypothetical (e.g., ""IF I DIE""), not descriptive of initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no clear suicidal intent. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply. This fits 'Ideation': explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but no plan or preparatory behavior.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The author explicitly mentions ""contemplating suicide"" due to lack of joy in life and numbness. He describes a history of non-suicidal self-harm (cutting to subvert pain) but no indication that this was intended as suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness, anhedonia (""don't get any joy out of life""), and feelings of being disconnected (""don't feel love for anyone""). He references a suicide pact: ""we agreed if she should want to kill herself then we will do it together."" This implies a conditional plan for joint suicide, but no specific method, tools, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed for himself. The statement ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it"" indicates a clear desire to die, contingent on her death, but with no imminent timeline or action described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (""contemplating suicide"") and expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I didn't want to live before I met her,"" ""I'm ending it""). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, they are presented as a genuine desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A plan is mentioned: ""we agreed if she should want to kill herself then we will do it together."" This indicates a conditional suicide pact. However, no specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are described for the author himself. The reference to the girl's method (cutting wrists) is about her, not the author. Since the plan is contingent on her decision and lacks concrete details about execution, it is not a fully developed plan with method or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past self-harm (cutting), but this is characterized as non-suicidal (""to subvert the pain to a physical one""), not an initiated lethal action. The suicide contemplation is current (""for the past month"") and future-oriented (""I'm ending it"" if she is gone), but no past or recent suicidal actions by the author are described. The girl's failed suicide attempt is not the author's action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - There is explicit suicidal desire (""contemplating suicide,"" ""I didn't want to live""), so it is not 'Indicator'.
   - No specific method, tools, or preparations are mentioned for the author, only a conditional plan. Since the plan lacks concrete details and is contingent on external factors, it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' (where explicit method/preparation is required). Per the rules: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""
   - No initiated, potentially lethal action by the author is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': explicit personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but without a clear plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicitly discusses killing oneself (""Why is it frowned upon to kill yourself?"") and states ""I need to die because it's better than living in pain.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""Life isn't worth it without her""), despair (""I can't move on""), isolation (""I'm alone""), and self-perception as unfixable (""People like me are fundamentally wrong"").  
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""I need to die"") and rationalization of suicide (""It's perfectly reasonable"").  
   - No specific plans/methods: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - No past actions: No description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill yourself"" (rhetorically) and personally declares ""I need to die."" The desire is affirmed, not negated (e.g., no ""but I won't act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal desire is clear, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan, or preparation is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on *current* emotional pain and abstract justification for suicide. No reference to past or imminent concrete actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""I need to die"") and rationalization of suicide surpass general distress, ruling out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present, but **no plan/method/preparation** is mentioned. Thus, it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. Fits 'Ideation'.

To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post consists of abusive quotes from the author's parents, including repeated direct commands to die by suicide (e.g., ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already""), mocking references to past suicide attempts/self-harm (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""cut your wrists again""), and severe emotional abuse (e.g., blaming the author, calling them a burden). The author does **not** personally express any current suicidal thoughts, plans, or desires. The only self-referential content is the author questioning their father (""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place?""), which reflects distress but not suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The parents explicitly mention suicide/death, but **the author never personally expresses a desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or intent**.  
   - The author's own words show distress but no suicidal ideation. References to past actions (e.g., vomiting food, self-harm) are reported by the parents, not described firsthand by the author.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the author. The parents reference methods (gun, cutting wrists), but these are commands/taunts, not the author's stated plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The parents allude to past suicide attempts/self-harm by the author (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again""), but the author **does not describe these actions firsthand**. The post lacks details about the recency, nature, or lethality of these past events from the author's perspective.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses distress (e.g., questioning their father's treatment) but **no personal desire to die, suicidal ideation, plan, or description of self-initiated actions**.  
   - Parental quotes about suicide are abusive provocations, not admissions of current intent by the author. References to past behaviors are vague and secondhand.  
   - This fits **Indicator**: The post reveals extreme distress and an abusive environment, including harmful references to suicide, but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, ideation, plans, or firsthand accounts of attempts by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""kill myself"" (with ""Kim's"" likely a typo for ""kill myself""), indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include distress and urgency, such as ""I just need a way to kill myself"" and frustration with non-answers (""I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The user is asking for information on methods but does not state or imply they have chosen one or are preparing.
   - No references to past actions (e.g., attempts) are present; the focus is on current thoughts and seeking information.
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""), but there is a sense of urgency in the request.
   - The writer expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I just need a way to kill myself"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are actively pursuing the idea.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""kill myself"" (implied from ""Kim's"").
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die, such as ""I just need a way to kill myself,"" indicating a personal wish not to be alive.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; the writer is seeking actionable information, reinforcing genuine desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The user asks for ""the least painful way"" but does not name or imply a chosen method (e.g., pills, jumping) or any steps taken (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).
   - Without an explicit plan/method/preparation, this leans toward 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and intentions (asking for methods), not past events.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no mention of an attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""I just need a way to kill myself""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which lacks such desire).
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, only a general inquiry about methods. This distinguishes it from 'Behavior' (which requires explicit mention of these elements).
   - Since no past or recent suicidal action is described, 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the expressed desire to die without evidence of planning or action.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: Mentions ""write a suicidal note again,"" indicating preparation for suicide. Describes intense emotional distress (""stomach convulsing from pain"").
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""suicidal note"" directly ties to suicide intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Severe internal pain/hopelessness implied.
   - Preparation: Writing a suicide note is a recognized preparatory step.
   - Imminence: ""Going to"" suggests imminent action.
   - Desire: Implied desire to die via preparation (note-writing).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""Suicidal note"" explicitly links to suicide. The phrase ""again"" confirms personal history/current intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. ""Write a suicidal note"" is explicit preparation. No method mentioned, but preparation alone qualifies.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes future preparation (""going to write""). No past/current *action* (e.g., no overdose attempt). Preparation ≠ initiated lethal action.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post contains two key elements: ""committing a massacre"" (which implies harming others, not self-harm) and ""slaying myself"" (a direct reference to suicide or self-harm). ""Slaying myself"" explicitly mentions death/dying/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The phrase ""I will end up"" suggests hopelessness or resignation, but no explicit despair, anhedonia, or burden statements are present.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned for ""slaying myself."" The language is vague and non-specific.
   - References to past actions: None; the post is future-oriented (""will end up,"" ""maybe"").
   - Imminence: No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""); the wording is tentative and hypothetical.
   - Stated desire: ""Maybe just slaying myself"" indicates the author is expressing a personal consideration of suicide, but it lacks explicit negation (e.g., ""I don't want to""). The desire appears genuine, though ambivalent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""slaying myself,"" a direct phrase for suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""I will end up... slaying myself"" in a context of resignation).
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to"").
   - Therefore, this does not lean toward 'Indicator' and indicates suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned for ""slaying myself."" The term is general and lacks detail.
   - No signs of preparation are present.
   - Since there is a desire to die but no plan/method/preparation, this aligns with 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""will end up,"" ""maybe"") with no reference to past events.
   - No initiated actions (e.g., attempts, interruptions) are described; it is purely contemplative.
   - Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""slaying myself""), so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal thoughts without specific plans or actions.

418,"I wish I had friends. I wish I had friends so badly. I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep distress about loneliness, lack of motivation, academic struggles, and feelings of inadequacy. The author explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" but immediately clarifies it stems from shame about ""not being anybody"" and states, ""I don't want to die— I want to live."" No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions are described. The focus is on internal struggles (daydreaming, passivity) and a plea for advice to overcome them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrase: ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned.  
   - Desire to die: **Negated** by the author (""I don't want to die— I want to live"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly framed as **unwanted** (""stems from shame"").  
   → Leans heavily toward 'Indicator' due to the explicit negation of desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   → Absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm). Mentions of past failures (academic) are unrelated to suicidal acts.  
   → Rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses suicidal ideation but **explicitly states no genuine desire to die** and attributes the thoughts to shame.  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or action is present.  
   - The core content aligns with **distress about life circumstances** (isolation, inertia) rather than active suicidal intent.  
   → Fits 'Indicator' (unwanted suicidal thoughts without current desire/plan).

But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?. I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it. And before anybody says anything, no, I'm not calling a suicide hotline. I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions wanting to use a specific method (dad's handgun) to shoot themselves in the head, indicating a clear desire to die. It also expresses hesitation due to fear of surviving with disabilities and explicitly rejects seeking help (suicide hotline). No past actions are described—only contemplation of a future act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""shoot myself in the head"" confirms direct suicidal intent.  
   - Desire to die is stated (""I wanna...""), but hesitation stems from fear of consequences, not a lack of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: ""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself"" details both the tool (handgun) and the means (shooting).  
   - Preparation: Mentioning ""get my dad's handgun"" implies intent to acquire the means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses a future intention (""wanna,"" ""I'm not risking it"").  
   - No past or recent initiated action described—only hypothetical outcomes.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - Hesitation doesn't negate the presence of a plan/method.  
   - No concrete action taken (rules out Attempt).  
   - Explicit plan/method distinguishes it from Ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""my life isn't worth living anymore""), despair (""I feel so helpless, angry and sad""), anhedonia (""There is nothing I can enjoy anymore""), and perceived burdensomeness (reliance on welfare/parents).  
   - Mentions of death/dying: References life being ""unbearable"" and states ""my life isn't worth living anymore"" and ""can't see myself having a life worth living.""  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focus is on suffering, helplessness, and hatred of circumstances/world, with a passive wish for divine intervention rather than self-initiated lethal action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit statements of a desire to die.  
   - Describes life as ""unbearable"" and ""not worth living"" but frames it as a consequence of illness (""If my breathing doesn’t go back to normal...""), not an active intent to end life.  
   - **No expression of current suicidal thoughts or desire to die**. The distress centers on suffering, not a wish for death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are referenced.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Discusses ongoing suffering since 2020 and current despair. **No description** of past or imminent self-harm actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress, hopelessness, and despair** due to chronic illness and life circumstances, with passive expressions about life’s lack of value.  
   - Lacks **personal desire to die**, explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Expresses severe emotional pain and hopelessness but lacks suicidal intent, ideation, or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""don't see the point anymore"") and a sense of despair.
   - A timeline is provided: waiting until after Christmas and aiming for completion by February (""by February I think I'll be gone""). However, no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - There are no references to past actions, attempts, or preparations; the content is entirely future-oriented.
   - The desire to die is clear and personal, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I think I'll be gone"").
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them. The phrasing suggests acceptance and intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present.
   - The timeline (""by February"") indicates intent but does not constitute a detailed plan or method. Without explicit details, this remains at the level of ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I think I'm going to kill myself soon,"" ""by February"") with no mention of past or recent actions.
   - There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was started but stopped). The content is purely prospective.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator' (which requires lack of personal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - The absence of a specific method, plan, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (which requires such elements). The timeline alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' per the guidelines.
   - There is no description of past or recent initiated actions, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The core elements—explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, without a plan or method—align with 'Ideation'.

   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Too many problems"") and self-deprecation (""im a fucked up person"").
   - There is a future intention expressed with a timeframe (""this month""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""want to die"" and ""end my life,"" showing a clear personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. ""Gonna end my life this month"" implies intent but lacks concrete planning details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""this month"") with no indication of past or recent initiated actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I just want to die"") and suicidal thoughts (""gonna end my life"") place this above 'Indicator,' which requires no personal suicidal desire.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (e.g., no mention of how they will end their life).
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - This fits 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit personal suicidal thoughts and desire to die, but no plan or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses the user's perspective on the world's decline, mental illness, and mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" as part of their experience. Key elements include:
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but frames them as contributing to their understanding of the world (""helped me to understand the world"").
   - Expresses distress about societal issues and feeling misunderstood (""called pessimistic,"" ""suffering,"" ""got hate"").
   - No references to death/dying methods, plans, preparations, or timelines. 
   - No description of past/current self-harm actions. Suicidal thoughts are presented as an existing state, not a current intent to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" (Yes).
   - However, the context shows these thoughts are framed as *unwanted insights* (""helped me understand"") rather than expressing a current desire to die. The author does not state a wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. Focus is on philosophical/societal critique.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - No reference to past/recent self-harm actions or attempts. ""Suicidal thoughts"" are discussed as a general experience, not tied to imminent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" could suggest 'Ideation', but the context clarifies these are **unwanted** and not expressing a *current desire to die*. Instead, they are cited to explain the author's worldview.  
   - The primary sentiment is distress about societal issues and feeling misunderstood, with suicidal thoughts presented passively.  
   - Fits 'Indicator' per the rule: ""mentions of suicidal thoughts if these are explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die."" Ambiguity about genuine desire also defaults to 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide,"" ""kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothings gonna work""), despair (""I'm done being this sad fucked up person""), worthlessness (""maybe I wasn't cut out for life"").  
   - Plan/method: Specific timeline (""on my birthday"") and explicit planning (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out"").

   - No past actions described; focus is on future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""suicide,"" ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**. Desire is unambiguously stated (e.g., ""only solution,"" ""viable solution""). No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan**: Specific temporal plan (""on my birthday"") and active preparation (""time to plan it out"").  
   - Method not specified, but explicit planning elevates beyond ideation.

   - Future intention (""It'll be on my birthday"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes phrases like ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" and ""my death will be following very soon too,"" indicating a personal desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom"") and hopelessness, with references to recent family death amplifying distress.
   - Specific preparation is mentioned: ""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents,"" which is a concrete step in planning for death.
   - A timeframe is provided: ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend,"" showing imminence.
   - No method (e.g., pills, gun) is specified, but ""do this"" and ""attempt"" imply suicidal intent.
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on future intentions.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""do this"" and ""get it over with"" in context, combined with ""my death,"" strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - The desire to die is explicit (e.g., ""I want to do this once and for all"") and not negated as unwanted.
   - This confirms suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is not mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, or locations described), so this aspect is ambiguous.
   - However, clear preparation is stated: ""get a will in place,"" which is an explicit step in getting affairs in order for death.
   - The timeframe ""this weekend"" indicates planning.
   - Preparation aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"") with no mention of past or recent actions.
   - No initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., past attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and references to personal death rule out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of preparation (will) and a timeframe elevates this beyond 'Ideation', where no plan/preparation would be mentioned.
   - No past action means 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - With suicidal intent and preparation (even without a specified method), 'Behavior' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses a critical upcoming test that determines whether the author will ""live till October,"" expressing ambivalence about life and death. Explicitly states, ""I don't wanna die,"" and describes improved mood and future-oriented activities (e.g., moving, projects). Mentions methods like jumping or using blades but notes barriers: ""no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades I used to cut won't go that deep."" References past self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") but not as a suicide attempt. Emotional indicators include conditional hopelessness (""I really cannot live if I fail"") but also positive feelings (""almost happy,"" ""having a purpose,"" ""feeling better""). Imminence is tied to the test outcome, but no specific timeline for action is given. Desire to die is negated in the present, with focus on life activities.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide or death? No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" Desire to die is conditional (""I really cannot live if I fail"") but explicitly negated (""I don't wanna die""). Suicidal thoughts are implied but framed as unwanted due to current positive engagement. Leans toward 'Indicator' because the primary sentiment is distress about a hypothetical scenario, not a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Methods mentioned? Yes (jumping, blades, meds), but described as inaccessible or ineffective (""no access,"" ""no place,"" ""won't go that deep""). No signs of preparation; instead, life-oriented preparations (moving, room setup). No current plan indicated, so not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past actions? References past self-harm (""blades I used to cut""), but not described as a suicide attempt or initiated lethal action. No mention of past attempts. Future intentions are conditional and negated. No initiated actions, so not 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly unwanted and conditional, with no plan or preparation. The author expresses a lack of current desire to die and engagement in life activities. Ambiguity exists due to conditional ideation, but rules state: if suicidal thoughts are explicitly unwanted or desire is negated, lean 'Indicator'. Between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator' due to ambiguity and negated desire. No elements fit 'Behavior' (no plan) or 'Attempt' (no initiated action).

429,"Its official. I've failed, my retake classes are over 1000$. I'm now officially seen as a failure by my toxic family and my friends. Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't, I'll finally be able to do what I want to do. Either kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun, or start cutting myself to try and ease my pain. My existence has been nothing but depression, fear, regret and worthlessness. Its a net gain for the world if i die. I'm such a fucking dumbass and a lazy asshole. How stupid am I to fail senior year. How stupid am I to still want the love and affection from a family that is toxic, gaslighting, mean and fake. Why couldn't I have been aborted. I'm just waiting for the end. I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone and cold. My body probably wouldn't be found for months until my bills start rising. And if im far enough away and cut off enough, then it'll never be know that I died. Nobody will remember me. I fucking hate myself. I'm sad. I want help so badly. But im afraid. Really afraid. Im sorry everyone. Im not strong enough.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses intense hopelessness, worthlessness (""net gain for the world if I die""), self-loathing, and despair. It explicitly mentions suicidal methods: ""slit my wrist and bleeding out"" and ""shoot myself with a gun."" It also references self-harm (""start cutting myself"") as a separate coping mechanism. The author states a clear desire to die (""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die alone"") and contextualizes future actions (""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do""). There is no mention of past actions or attempts, only future intentions.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong themes of depression, fear, regret, worthlessness, and isolation.  
   - **Plan/Method**: Specific methods (slitting wrists, shooting) are explicitly stated, alongside considerations of location and isolation (""if I'm far enough away... nobody will find me"").  
   - **Desire**: A genuine wish to die is evident (e.g., ""I want to do what I want to do"" followed by suicide methods; ""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and describes methods. The desire to die is personal, current, and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes, specific methods (slitting wrists, shooting) are mentioned. The author also alludes to logistical planning (e.g., waiting for a place, isolation to avoid discovery). No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described, but the method specificity qualifies as planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes future intentions (""I'll finally be able to do..."") with no mention of past actions. No initiated suicidal acts (e.g., ""I tried"") are reported.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method/plan details rule out 'Indicator'.  
   - The presence of a plan/method (slitting wrists, shooting) elevates this beyond 'Ideation'.  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - **Conclusion**: The combination of explicit suicidal desire and stated methods/plan aligns with 'Behavior'.

I'm 6'1 195 lbs., I genuinely enjoy working out and playing all kinds of sports. But whenever I confront someone about something my voice shakes.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of paranoia, abandonment, and confusion about reality. The author mentions being ""played"" by others, feeling unlovable, and having PTSD from a past breakup. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""this world is shit""), despair (""I just want someone to goddamn love me""), and overwhelming emotional pain (""I want to cry my damn eyes out""). There are **no mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The focus is on relational turmoil and existential crisis.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: **No**. The post contains no direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die/not be alive. The distress is centered on emotional suffering and confusion, not a wish to end life. Unwanted suicidal thoughts are not mentioned.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or other preparations for self-harm. The content remains focused on psychological anguish.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: Describes past events (breakup, possible PTSD) but **no initiated self-harm actions**. Mentions are about emotional trauma, not concrete suicidal behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows severe distress and risk factors (hopelessness, isolation, trauma) but lacks explicit suicidal desire, plans, methods, or descriptions of past attempts. Without any personal expression of suicidal intent or behavior, it aligns with **'Indicator'**. The core plea is for truth/validation amid emotional chaos, not a manifestation of active suicidality.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I wanna kill myself,"" and a strong desire to die (""I want to die because I hate myself"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing works anymore""), self-hatred, guilt, and feeling like a burden.  
   - Specific plans/methods are detailed: calculating lethal doses of isopropyl alcohol, testing noose attachment points, and timing to jump in front of a car (though ruled out).  
   - Preparations are evident: researching methods, calculating logistics, and planning to avoid detection.  
   - No past or recent *initiated actions* (e.g., attempts) are described—only contemplation and planning. The author states, ""I don't do it.""  
   - Temporal context: Current/future intentions (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"") but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""I want to die."" The desire is personal and current, not negated as unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (isopropyl poisoning, hanging, car collision) and preparations (calculating doses, testing noose points, timing routines) are explicitly mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing ideation and planning but **no initiated action**. The author emphasizes they have not acted (""I don’t do it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and detailed suicidal thoughts rule out *Indicator*.  
   - Specific methods and preparations elevate this beyond *Ideation* (thoughts without plans).  
   - No past/recent lethal action (e.g., ingesting poison or hanging) rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Behavior*: Explicit desire to die **with** plans (multiple methods) and preparations (research, calculations).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and rejects anti-suicide discourse, indicating personal suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i'm not cut out for life,"" ""i can't even imagine mine being worth living""), feelings of being a burden (""i know i'm selfish and weak""), and despair. There is a temporal element with ""the day i chose is very soon,"" implying imminence. The author contemplates actions like calling grandparents, telling friends they love them, and hugging their brother, which could be interpreted as potential farewells, but these are not confirmed preparations—the author expresses uncertainty (""not sure if that would like, haunt people more""). No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun) or concrete preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. References to past actions are limited to persistent desire (""i've wanted to do this for over a decade""), not initiated attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" rejection of anti-suicide discourse). Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the author resists intervention, indicating acceptance of these thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is mentioned. Contemplated actions (calling loved ones) are ambiguous and not explicitly stated as preparations for suicide—the author is hesitant and unsure. The phrase ""the day i chose is very soon"" suggests a timeframe but not a detailed plan. Since there is no explicit method or confirmed preparation, and due to uncertainty, this leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""the day i chose is very soon"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of a suicide attempt that was started and stopped). The reference to ""wanted to do this for over a decade"" is about persistent ideation, not a concrete past action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts, placing it above 'Indicator' (which lacks such intent). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or confirmed preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The lack of any described initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the author expresses a desire to die with some imminence but no clear plan or method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""the most suicidal I've been in a couple months"" and ""want to be out of my misery"" – explicit references to suicidal feelings and a desire to escape suffering.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""in pain for over 5 years,"" ""cba [can’t be bothered] anymore,"" hopelessness (""just want to be out of my misery"").  
   - Isolation intent: ""Not going to contact anyone,"" which may imply withdrawal but **no specific plan, method, or preparation** (e.g., no tools, location, or note mentioned).  
   - No reference to past/current actions (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""took pills,"" or similar).  
   - Temporal context: ""most suicidal... in a couple months"" suggests current intensity of ideation, but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") or action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal"" and ""want to be out of my misery,"" indicating a personal desire to die. No negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: Mentions isolation (""not going to contact anyone"") but no specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). Withdrawal alone is not a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current suicidal feelings** (""most suicidal... now""), not a past/future action. No initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""want to be out of my misery"") and personal admission of being suicidal confirm *Ideation*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned (isolation ≠ plan), so not *Behavior*.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of a past/recent concrete, self-initiated lethal action.

   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""Why is it so hard to die"") and hopelessness.  
   - The author mentions struggling to find a ""suitable way to go,"" implying they are considering methods but have not identified or prepared one. No specific method, plan, location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) is described.  
   - No past actions or attempts are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I just want to die""). The author does not negate or express distress about *unwanted* thoughts; instead, the focus is on the frustration of being unable to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - The author mentions a struggle to find a ""suitable way"" but does **not** specify a method, tool, location, or preparation. This reflects contemplation of methods without concrete planning or action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current feelings and desires. **No past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., initiated attempts) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and direct reference to suicide (""kill myself"") place this beyond **Indicator** (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - With no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action, **Attempt** does not apply.  
   - The core elements (explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts + no plan/method) align with **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions low self-esteem, loneliness, and distress (""zero social skills/low self-esteem/lonely"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness about life decisions (""Is it worth moving...?"", ""I wish I had them in the first place"").  
   - **No** references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focuses on seeking advice about improving life circumstances (moving countries, language barriers).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or desire to die.  
   - **No** expressions of wanting to ""be gone"" or ""end it.""  
   - Distress is life-oriented (social skills, loneliness) without suicidal context.

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses anger and hostility towards another person (""the guy who reported my post"") for causing the author's account to be banned.
   - Key elements include a wish for death directed at someone else (""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP""), but no mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the author themselves.
   - Emotional indicators: Anger and frustration are present, but no hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or feelings of being a burden from the author's perspective.
   - No specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations for suicide by the author are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or thoughts by the author.
   - Imminence: ""ASAP"" applies to the wish for another's death, not to any personal suicidal intent.
   - The author's stated desire is solely focused on harming another person, with no expression of personal suicidal thoughts or desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases related to the author.
   - No expression of a clear personal desire to die or not be alive; the death wish is entirely external.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, this does not apply. The absence of personal suicidal intent leans towards 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location for suicide by the author is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) for self-harm.
   - Without any plan or method related to the author, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references a past event (reporting leading to a ban) but only as a grievance, not as a suicidal action.
   - No description of any initiated suicidal action by the author, past or present.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress (anger over the ban) and discusses death abstractly (wishing death on another), but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, thoughts, plans, or actions by the author.
   - This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes expressions of distress or abstract death-related content without personal suicidal intent.
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because there is no personal desire to die; 'Behavior' requires a plan/method for suicide, which is absent; and 'Attempt' requires a past or recent initiated action, which is not described.
   - Per the rules, the risk is only for the author, and the content is ambiguous about suicidal desire but clearly not self-directed, so 'Indicator' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post primarily focuses on homicidal intent (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her"") directed at a bully.
   - Mentions ""suicide"" abstractly when describing a type of suicide involving killing others, but **no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, self-harm, or suicide methods for the author**.
   - Emotional indicators: Anger, frustration, and distress about bullying, but no hopelessness/despair about the author’s own life or existence.

   - The author expresses distress (bullying) and violent homicidal ideation but **no personal desire for self-harm/suicide**. 
   - Abstract mention of suicide lacks personal relevance or intent. 
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without current personal suicidal desire. 
   - Does not meet thresholds for Ideation (no suicidal desire), Behavior (no suicide plan), or Attempt (no self-initiated lethal action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""I'm on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all.""  
   - Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""I seriously cannot do this anymore,"" ""I'm such a disappointment and failure""), despair, and stress (""mental health really bad,"" ""stress of college"").  
   - There is an implied plan or method with ""I know exactly what to do,"" but no specific details (e.g., tools, location, substance) are provided.  
   - No references to past actions or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - Imminence is suggested by ""on the verge,"" but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is given.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to end it all"") with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all.""  
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to end it all"").  
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the desire appears genuine.  
   - This rules out 'Indicator' and supports 'Ideation' or higher.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is explicitly mentioned.  
   - ""I know exactly what to do"" implies knowledge of a potential plan but lacks explicit detail about the method or preparations.  
   - Since the rule states, ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior',"" this leans toward 'Ideation'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  
   - No concrete, potentially lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die supports 'Ideation' over 'Indicator'.  
   - The implied plan (""I know exactly what to do"") is not explicit enough for 'Behavior' per the rules, as no specific method or preparation is mentioned. When unsure, 'Ideation' is chosen over 'Behavior'.  
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - Final category: 'Ideation' (explicit desire to die with thoughts of suicide but no explicit plan, method, or preparation).

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains key phrases: ""Someone kill me"" and ""I just wanna die."" These directly reference death/dying and express a personal desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: The tone suggests despair or hopelessness (e.g., ""I just wanna die you know"").
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors.
   - No indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the desire is stated generally.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal wish to die (""I just wanna die"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions death/suicide with phrases like ""kill me"" and ""wanna die.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I just wanna die"").
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don't want to""). This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The focus is solely on the desire to die, with no actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current state of mind (e.g., ""I just wanna die"") with no reference to past or recent actions. No initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt) is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""I just wanna die""), meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The expression of distress includes a direct wish to die, so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - Conclusion: 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post conveys suicidal thoughts with desire but no plan or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""am tired of being unhappy""), despair (""lost and alone""), depression, and shame related to sexuality, gender dysphoria, and past trauma (molestation). Key phrases focus on pleading for change (""make me straight,"" ""take all gayness away"") and relief from suffering (""take all depression everything negative out my life""). There are **no mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The core plea is for transformation (""be normal"") and removal of unwanted thoughts/feelings.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - **No expression** of a desire to die/not be alive (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Distress centers on wanting to *change*, not cease existing.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**. The closest reference is asking God to ""take all thoughts away,"" but this is framed as removing ""gayness"" and ""depression,"" not suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No reference** to methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes), or timelines for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past trauma (molestation) and lifelong unhappiness but **no description** of past/recent suicidal actions or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress, depression, and hopelessness but **lacks any explicit or implicit desire to die**, suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or actions.  
   - The plea to remove negative thoughts/feelings (""take all thoughts away"") is tied to identity struggles, not suicide.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Expresses psychological pain and a wish to escape suffering through change (not death), with no suicidal intent.

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses chronic knee pain, frustration with lack of improvement (""doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""all the stretching in the world makes no difference""), and a sense of hopelessness about the future (""no change in sight""). The phrase ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" is a rhetorical question inquiring if others feel suicidal due to similar pain, but it is not a direct personal statement from the author about their own suicidal thoughts or actions. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, self-harm, specific plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions by the author. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness related to physical pain, but no explicit personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post mentions the word ""suicidal"" in a question about others, not as a personal declaration (e.g., the author does not say ""I am suicidal"" or ""I want to die""). There is no explicit expression of a personal desire to die, commit suicide, or not be alive. The suicidal reference is abstract and directed outward, lacking any indication that the author endorses or experiences these feelings personally. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide plans, methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content focuses solely on the experience of pain and its impact, with no connection to suicidal behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes an ongoing issue (8 months of knee pain) with no references to past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors by the author. It is entirely focused on current distress without any action-oriented suicidal content.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness related to physical pain, but there is no clear, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, preparation, or past attempt by the author. The mention of ""suicidal"" is indirect and inquires about others, which does not constitute personal suicidal intent. Under the rules, this fits 'Indicator' as it shows distress without explicit personal suicidal ideation. If there were ambiguity, 'Indicator' would be chosen over 'Ideation' due to the lack of personal desire.

442,"Will somebody just love me. This year has absolutely destroyed me mentally. I don't think I can go on much longer. Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness of no purpose. My substance abuse is rooted in the need to be loved. Does anyone else feel this way? I'm married and I feel alone in my own head. I wish my partner would care about me the way I do about them. I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""pain,"" ""no purpose,"" ""feel alone,"" ""abandoned,"" ""irreparable damage,"" ""distant,"" ""over life.""  
   - Expresses desire for death: ""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death,"" ""its finally over.""  
   - References suicide indirectly: Comfort in idea of reuniting with a loved one who died by suicide.  
   - **No explicit mention of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions**. The phrase ""one last record"" is ambiguous but lacks specificity (e.g., no timeline, method, or preparatory steps).  
   - Focuses on despair and hopelessness, with death framed as relief but **no actionable intent described**.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""give in to the nothingness that is death,"" ""its finally over"").  
   - **No** statements negating this desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, tools, location, or preparations** mentioned (e.g., pills, notes, dates).  
   - ""One last record"" is vague; insufficient to indicate planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future desire** for death.  
   - **No past or recent self-initiated lethal actions** (only references a loved one’s suicide).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""give in to death,"" ""its finally over"") but **no plan/method/preparation**.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire to die is explicit and personal (not abstract/unwanted).  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method mentioned.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent suicidal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions a desire to die: ""I want to die so she can feel pain and hurt."" This indicates personal suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include anger, resentment, and a sense of being belittled by the mother, but no explicit hopelessness or despair about life itself; the focus is on causing pain to the mother through death.
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method, plan, or preparation (e.g., no tools, locations, substances, or actions like writing a note). The phrase ""Not sure how much but wherever it is, it'll be worth it"" is vague and refers to the outcome (pain inflicted) rather than a method or plan for suicide.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""it'll be worth it""), but no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with ""I want to die,"" indicating clear personal suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author is resisting them (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to die""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The vagueness of ""wherever it is"" does not constitute a plan or method, and there is no evidence of actionable steps. This absence means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a current desire and future intention but no past or recent suicidal actions. No initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., attempts) are referenced, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") confirms 'Ideation' over 'Indicator', as there is clear personal suicidal intent.
   - The lack of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify for 'Behavior' (e.g., no specifics on how the suicide would occur).
   - No descriptions of past or recent suicidal actions rule out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as the post expresses a desire to die without concrete plans or methods.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific suicide methods: ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" and desire for a gun (""access to a gun"").  
   - Expresses explicit desire to die: ""I just want my death to come faster,"" and references death as relief (""at least I'll be able to see my dad again"").  
   - Describes **active self-harm**: ""I've started to try and starve myself,"" indicating initiation of a method.  
   - States timeline: ""dead by the end of the week.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I can't do anything right""), worthlessness (""I'm truly useless""), and burden (""I'm a nuisance"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""access to a gun,"" and ""I just want my death to come faster."" The desire to die is unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Multiple specific methods are named (starvation, hanging, firearm). **Active preparation** is confirmed: ""I've started to try and starve myself."" This is a current behavior, not just ideation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing self-harm action** (starvation) with intent to die. No past *lethal* attempt is mentioned (e.g., no reference to a prior overdose or interrupted hanging).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and active self-harm rule this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific methods and **initiated action** (starvation) exceed mere thoughts.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of a past/recent *completed* lethal act (e.g., ""I took pills yesterday"").  
   - **Behavior**: Fits due to **active preparation** (ongoing starvation as a suicide method) and explicit plans (multiple methods mentioned).

It feels like everything that makes me 'me' is just the potential I possess to achieve different things, but nothing ever works out. My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror. I try and reflect on it, but all I can see is my fucked up posture, my body getting older and less capable before I've even been allowed to start enjoying my youth. When does any of this get better, and please God how can I fix it myself?. I plan my suicide every single day. Sometimes the solace of that escapism is the only thing keeping me going. I just want to take a day to myself, just way out in the desert with some coffee. Obviously I have realistic and practical plans like using a pistol or an escape bag, but the most appealing idea by far is just to douse myself in gasoline and light up.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements include expressions of hopelessness (""I just don't want to go on anymore,"" ""nothing ever works out,"" ""My life has already been over""), anhedonia (""Nothing interests me anymore,"" ""can't feel anything""), and despair (""I'm so tired,"" ""I need to catch a break""). 
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""I plan my suicide every single day"" and specific methods like ""using a pistol or an escape bag"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up."" 
   - Emotional indicators are strong, with grief, rage, and bitterness described. 
   - There is no mention of past suicide attempts or initiated actions; the focus is on current/future planning. 
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., the planning provides ""solace"" as escapism). 
   - No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated, but the planning is daily.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and describes a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I plan my suicide every single day,"" ""I just don't want to go on anymore""). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are a coping mechanism.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned: ""using a pistol or an escape bag"" and ""douse myself in gasoline and light up."" The phrase ""I have realistic and practical plans"" directly indicates planning. No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the mention of specific methods qualifies as planning under the 'Behavior' definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""I plan my suicide every single day"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions. It does not describe any concrete, potentially lethal action that was carried out, interrupted, or failed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') due to the explicit personal desire to die.
   - It exceeds 'Ideation' because specific methods (pistol, escape bag, gasoline) are mentioned, indicating planning.
   - There is no evidence of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The combination of suicidal desire and specific methods aligns with 'Behavior', as defined by the presence of a plan or method, even if brief.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post details multiple past suicide attempts: cutting wrists at 11, laying on a road at 19, and jumping in front of a train at 24.  
   - It describes a **recent action**: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck."" This is a specific, potentially lethal act initiated by the author.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't go on like this""), isolation (""I have nobody""), trauma (childhood rape), and despair (""God left me alone"").  
   - The author expresses ongoing suicidal thoughts (""I've been suicidale all my life"") and a current plan (""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it"").  
   - The action was interrupted by self-doubt (""I'm a chicken"") and concern for a friend (""I can't leave him alone"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, explicit phrases include ""suicidale all my life,"" past attempts, and ""do it"" (referencing suicide). Desire to die is clear.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Specific method mentioned**: ""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" (hanging). Preparations are implied (acquiring rope, positioning chair).  
   - A future plan is noted (""grab some dinner and then do it""), but the **recent action** is already initiated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The rope incident is a **recent, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (""just stood""). It was interrupted by the author (""I failed because..."") but still constitutes an initiated attempt.  
   - Past attempts (wrist-cutting, train-jumping) are also described, but the **recent action** takes precedence for classification.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The rope incident is not just ideation or planning; it is a **concrete, initiated action** that was potentially lethal, fitting the 'Attempt' definition (""initiated... even if interrupted"").  
   - Current distress and future plans are secondary to the described recent action.  
   - Rules prioritize 'Attempt' when a specific, life-threatening action by the author has occurred.

I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions death/dying (""if I die then I die,"" ""accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier""), emotional indicators like hopelessness (""the future is really grim""), and a sense of resignation (""it's not worth pushing my life further""). There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The writer explicitly states, ""I don't have any plans to end it,"" indicating a lack of intent to act. The behavior described—stopping doctor visits—is framed as passive acceptance of potential death rather than active self-harm. No past actions or imminent timelines are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The desire expressed is passive resignation to death (e.g., ""if I die then I die"") rather than an active wish to die. The writer negates suicidal intent by stating they have ""no plans to end it."" Suicidal thoughts are questioned abstractly (""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?""), but not personally claimed as a current desire. This leans toward 'Indicator' because the primary sentiment is distress and hopelessness without genuine suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. Stopping doctor visits could imply self-neglect, but it is not presented as a means to suicide and is explicitly separated from plans to ""end it."" With no plan/method, this cannot be 'Behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and decisions (e.g., not visiting doctors) but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts). The focus is on future acceptance of death, not imminent risk.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The writer expresses general distress, hopelessness, and passive thoughts about death but lacks a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide. The explicit denial of plans (""I don't have any plans to end it"") and absence of suicidal intent align with 'Indicator.' While there is resignation to dying early, this is not equivalent to active suicidal ideation, and the ambiguity about desire (e.g., questioning if not going to doctors is suicidal) falls under 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes emotional indicators like self-hatred (""I just fucking hate myself""), hopelessness (feeling like a coward, too depressed for friends, too ugly for a relationship), and despair about physical health (thyroid issues, inability to lose weight).
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""kill myself,"" but it is framed in the context of the writer being ""too much of a coward"" to act on it, indicating a barrier to action.
   - There is no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide described. The mention of ""starve myself"" is in the context of weight loss struggles, not as a suicide method.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are present.
   - No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") suggest imminence; the tone is general and self-critical.
   - The writer's stated desire regarding suicide is conflicted: suicidal thoughts are acknowledged but attributed to cowardice, implying resistance to acting on them. The primary sentiment is distress about their situation, not a clear intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase related to suicide.
   - However, the expression of desire to die is negated by the writer's self-identification as ""too much of a coward"" to act, which suggests the suicidal thoughts are not accompanied by a current personal intent to die. Instead, it indicates distress about having these thoughts without the will to carry them out.
   - Since the writer implies resistance to acting on suicidal thoughts (leaning toward unwanted thoughts), this aligns more with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. ""Kill myself"" is general, and ""starve myself"" is discussed only in relation to weight loss, not suicide.
   - Without any plan or preparation elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and inaction, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions. Phrases like ""too cowardly to kill myself"" emphasize contemplation without initiation.
   - No evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit personal suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") but frames them as unwanted due to cowardice, indicating a lack of current desire to act. This aligns with 'Indicator', which covers distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts without genuine intent.
   - There is ambiguity about the writer's genuine suicidal desire (e.g., whether the thoughts reflect a true wish to die or are part of self-loathing). Per the rule, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.
   - No plan/method exists, ruling out 'Behavior', and no past action, ruling out 'Attempt'.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses helping a friend who is ""struggling and thinking about suicide,"" but this is in the context of giving advice, not from the author's personal perspective.
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods related to the author themselves.
   - Emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair) are absent for the author; the tone is informative and supportive, focusing on general advice.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned for the author.
   - The author does not express any personal desire to die, unwanted suicidal thoughts, or distress about themselves; instead, they are sharing strategies for supporting others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly, but only in reference to a friend (""a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide""). It does not express any personal suicidal intent or desire to die from the author. Therefore, explicit intent from the author is **No**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No plan, method, or preparation is described for the author. The discussion is abstract and focused on helping others, not on the author's own actions or intentions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes general advice and does not reference any past or recent actions initiated by the author (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, self-harm, or preparatory behaviors).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly (in the context of helping a friend) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, preparation, or action from the author. This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes general or abstract discussions of suicide without current, personal suicidal intent from the writer. There is no evidence to support 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' since the author does not express personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Explicitly states ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""driving me further to killing myself,"" and ""nature is telling me it's time to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no reason to live,"" ""waste of life""), despair (""I just don't have anyone""), isolation, and self-blame (""bad karma"").  
   - Methods/preparations: **No specific plan, method, tool, location, or preparation** described (e.g., no pills/weapons for suicide, no notes, no goodbye actions). Mentions stopping medication and drinking but frames these as coping mechanisms, not suicide preparations.  
   - Past actions: Stopped medication and increased drinking, but these are contextualized as responses to distress, **not** initiated suicidal acts.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound intent (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly endorses suicidal thoughts (""finally becoming content with that"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and ""suicide is their life's purpose.""  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""nature is telling me it's time to die"").  
   - **No**: No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: Despite heavy distress and suicidal desire, **no specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no overdose plan, no weapon, no location). References to medication (Ativan) and alcohol are about coping, not suicide means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past/current initiated lethal action**: Stopping medication/drinking is not described as a suicide attempt. The phrase ""took my last Ativan"" refers to consumption as coping, not self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (rules out *Indicator*).  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** mentioned (rules out *Behavior*).  
   - **No description of past/recent initiated lethal action** (rules out *Attempt*).  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Strong expressions of wanting to die and suicidal thoughts without concrete plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions a specific method: drowning (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"").
    - Expresses belief in the method's effectiveness (""guaranteed death"") and positive framing (""peaceful,"" ""nice smooth transition"").
    - Explicit personalization: ""I think its the best option for me,"" ""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that.""
    - No explicit negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to"").
    - No past actions described; focuses on future intent conditional on an event (being kicked out).
    - No preparations mentioned (e.g., no note-writing or location scouting beyond generic ""ocean"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but strong implied desire: ""best option for me"" (referring to drowning), ""transition to death."" The framing is personal and affirmative, not abstract or unwanted.  
    - **Yes**, clear desire to die is expressed through context.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Specific method is explicitly named and evaluated: drowning (""drowning yourself,"" ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"").  
    - No preparations described, but the method is concrete and tied to a condition (being kicked out).  
    - **Yes**, method is specified → leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes a potential future action (""If I get kicked out... I might go and do that"").  
    - No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"" or ""I went to the bridge but stopped"").  
    - Conditional language (""might"") but still signals intent under specific circumstances.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - **Not 'Indicator'**: Desire to die is present and method is discussed (not abstract/unwanted thoughts).  
    - **Not 'Ideation'**: While desire is present, a specific method (drowning) is explicitly named and rationalized.  
    - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of past/current initiated lethal actions.  
    - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific method (drowning) mentioned, even if conditional on future events. The presence of a method trumps 'Ideation'.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions death/suicide explicitly: ""Surely, suicide is appropriate now?"", ""Death seems a better option"", ""I don't want to live"", ""call it quits"".
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""all been for nothing""), despair (""I don't see what there is to live for""), anhedonia (""I just feel like I am ‘existing’""), burden (""constant pressure"").
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out"".

   - No past actions initiated (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").
   - Imminence: None specified (e.g., ""tonight"").

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. However, it frames these in the context of having a reason not to act (""Star Wars just gave me a reason not to kill myself"") and explicitly postpones any attempts (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so""). 
   - Emotional tone is positive due to the Star Wars news, with phrases like ""it's all I've ever wanted"" and ""I need to know what happens,"" showing hope and future-oriented motivation. 
   - No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no details on how, when, or where an attempt might occur). 
   - No references to past actions or initiated behaviors (e.g., no description of a prior attempt). 
   - Imminence is low, as suicide attempts are postponed for years (""next decade or so""). 
   - The writer's stated desire is not to act on suicidal thoughts currently, as they express a reason to live.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating awareness of suicidal thoughts.
   - However, the desire to die is negated by the context: the writer has a ""reason not to kill myself"" and is postponing attempts. The primary sentiment is relief or distraction from suicidal thoughts, not a current, personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. References to suicide are general and lack concrete details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions (""postpone any suicide attempts"") but no past or recent actions are described. No initiated, potentially lethal behavior is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted or not acted upon due to external motivation (Star Wars news). This aligns with 'Indicator,' which includes distress about suicidal thoughts when the desire to die is not current or personal.
   - While suicidal language is used, the lack of desire, plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Ideation,' 'Behavior,' or 'Attempt.' The writer's focus on postponement and hope indicates the thoughts are not accompanied by intent.
   - Per the rules, if ambiguous about genuine suicidal desire, default to 'Indicator.'

I have no skills, no talents, nothing, I'm such a fucking worthless loser with nothing to contribute to this world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness, despair, and a desire to escape life (""no will to live,"" ""tired and beaten,"" ""can't take it anymore""). It explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""I just want to end it all"" and emphasizes the burden of living. There are no references to specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the focus is on current feelings and thoughts. The desire to die is personal and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the phrase ""end it all"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent, indicating a genuine desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on it""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The expression ""end it all"" is vague and lacks details like means, tools, or steps. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and ideation without any reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated suicide attempts). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I just want to end it all"") and personal expression of suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator', which requires ambiguity about desire or unwanted thoughts. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify for 'Behavior'. Since no concrete actions are described, 'Attempt' is ruled out. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' due to the clear suicidal desire without actionable elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains intense self-loathing (""disappointment,"" ""no talent,"" ""useless bitch,"" ""no value""), expressions of worthlessness, and sexual degradation.  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is stated: **""I'm going to kill myself""** is a direct declaration.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), plan (time/location), or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal statement (""I'm going to kill myself"") is future-oriented but lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") or description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **No** reference to a past attempt or interrupted action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"") rules out **Indicator** (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of a method/plan rules out **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes severe distress: extreme sleep deprivation (1 hour per night), paranoia (""everyone is in on it""), feelings of persecution (landlord/neighbors conspiring), helplessness (""no money to leave""), and a recent MS diagnosis.  
   - Mentions ""dead body smell"" as part of a perceived conspiracy, not self-harm.  
   - Emotional indicators: exhaustion (""I'm so tired""), persecution (""torture from these people""), hopelessness (""I don't know what options I have left""), and delusional thinking (""this is hell"").  
   - **No explicit or implicit references to suicide, self-harm, death wishes, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.** Phrases like ""I just wanna leave this place"" and ""I want to leave"" reflect a desire to escape circumstances, not end life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** direct phrases (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die"").  
   - **No** expressions of a desire to die or not be alive. Distress is directed at external situations (housing, neighbors, illness).

   - Expresses despair (""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" loss of identity/hope).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""Possible suicide date is in July,"" indicating personal desire/consideration.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan**: The phrase ""suicide date is in July"" implies a timeline/preparation, falling under planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""in July"") with no mention of past/initiated lethal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal suicidal intent exists.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating explicit references to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include sadness, hopelessness (e.g., ""I will always be a loser,"" ""never make friends""), and despair (""It hurts so much"").
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes) are described.
   - No references to past suicide-related actions or attempts; the focus is on thoughts.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated; instead, the writer states a future-oriented hope (""I can only hope that my life will get better"").
   - The writer explicitly negates the desire to act on suicidal thoughts due to religious beliefs (""I will probably never kill myself because... a big sin""), framing the thoughts as unwanted and distressing rather than a genuine wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself.""
   - However, the writer clearly states they do not want to act on these thoughts and expresses a lack of desire to die (e.g., ""I will probably never kill myself,"" ""I can only hope that my life will get better""). The suicidal thoughts are presented as involuntary and distressing, not as a current personal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned or implied. The discussion remains at the level of thoughts and feelings.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing emotional experiences (e.g., ""whenever I see happy people"") but no past or recent suicidal actions. It does not reference any initiated, potentially lethal behaviors (e.g., no descriptions of self-harm, attempts, or near-attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly negates the desire to die or act, aligning with 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts without current personal intent).
   - Without a genuine desire to die or any plan/method, it does not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit personal desire).
   - No evidence of planning/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Given the explicit statement of not wanting to act and the focus on distress, 'Indicator' is the best fit, especially considering the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" Here, the lack of desire is clear.

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm just so tired of failing everyone""), despair (""I can't fucking do another year""), and self-blame.  
   - Plan/preparation: Specific timeframe (""on new year's eve"") and references to suicide notes (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"").  
   - Past actions: Mentions creating suicide notes (preparatory behavior), but no description of an initiated lethal action (e.g., taking pills, cutting).  
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""ending it all""), with no indication the thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Ending it all"" is a direct phrase for suicide, and ""this is the one"" confirms resolve.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A specific timeframe (""new year's eve"") and repeated preparation (""3 other suicide notes"") indicate planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"") and past preparations (notes).  
   - No initiated lethal action (e.g., ""tried to overdose"")—notes are preparatory, not an attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Plan/timeframe and preparations (notes) exceed mere thoughts.  
   - **Not Attempt**: References past notes (preparatory behavior), not a concrete lethal action.  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific plan (New Year's Eve) + preparations (multiple notes).

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions a past action: ""tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown."" Cutting is a form of self-harm, but it is not explicitly linked to suicide or a desire to die. The context indicates it was impulsive (""during a breakdown,"" ""kind of drunk"") and driven by a need to ""feel something real,"" not to end life. Emotional indicators include distress from a ""very bad night,"" but no explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden statements related to suicide. There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, or specific suicidal methods/plans. The focus is on how to disclose this incident to a friend, not on current or future suicidal intent. The action is described as a one-time event with no prior desire (""I've never done it or wanted to do it before"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. No expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., the phrase ""wanted to feel something real"" suggests emotional coping, not death-seeking). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of unwanted suicidal thoughts either. Leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A method (cutting) is mentioned, but it is tied to a past action, not a current or future plan. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., no note, acquiring means for suicide) or any indication of ongoing planning. The context frames cutting as an isolated incident for emotional release, not as part of suicidal behavior. Since no current suicidal desire is expressed, and the method is not associated with suicide, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past action (""last night"") that was initiated (""tried to cut myself""). However, the action is not described as potentially lethal with suicidal intent; the stated intent was to ""feel something real,"" which aligns with non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI) rather than a suicide attempt. There is no reference to a concrete, life-threatening suicidal act. No current or imminent suicidal intentions are expressed. The past action does not qualify as an 'Attempt' because suicidal intent is absent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content expresses general distress and a past self-harm incident but lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal intent. It fits 'Indicator' because it discusses self-harm abstractly as part of distress, with no current suicidal expression. 'Ideation' is not applicable due to the absence of suicidal desire. 'Behavior' is not met because there is no plan or preparation for suicide, and the method mentioned is not tied to current suicidal thoughts. 'Attempt' does not apply because the past action was not described as suicidal (intent was for sensation, not death). Ambiguity about suicidal desire leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""plan to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""i have nothing and no one""), despair (""no purpose to live""), and self-perceived burden (""i became toxic"").
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.
   - Focuses on future intent with a rhetorical challenge (""Why shouldn't i?"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""plan to kill myself.""
   - **Yes**: Expresses desire to die (""no purpose to live"") without negation (e.g., no indication thoughts are unwanted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: Uses ""plan"" but lacks concrete details (method, tools, preparations).  
   - *Rule: Without explicit method/preparation, default to 'Ideation'.*

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes future intention (""plan to kill myself""), not past actions.  
   - No initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""plan to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No method/preparation mentioned (e.g., *how* or *with what*), so 'Ideation' applies.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal action.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself soon,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide and a personal desire to die. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped"") and a focus on the impact on others, but no expressions of unwanted thoughts or resistance to suicide.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or means is mentioned; the discussion centers on whether to inform others beforehand.
   - No references to past actions, preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or initiated attempts.
   - Imminence is implied with ""soon,"" but it is not specific (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").
   - The writer's stated desire is genuine, with no indication that suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, it reflects intent and consideration of the act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""killing myself soon,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., the focus is on carrying out suicide, not resisting it).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; the writer is contemplating logistics, suggesting acceptance of the desire.
   - This rules out 'Indicator' since there is a personal, current expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The mention of informing others is about communication, not a step in executing suicide.
   - Without a clear plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""killing myself soon"") with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I did"" statements), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""killing myself soon"") but lacks any plan, method, or preparation, fitting 'Ideation'.
   - It is not 'Indicator' because suicidal intent is clear and personal.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a specific plan or means (e.g., the discussion of informing others is not a suicidal method or preparation).
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent action is described.
   - The ambiguity around ""soon"" and the focus on communication do not elevate it to 'Behavior'; when unsure, 'Ideation' is chosen over 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide: ""kill myself tonight,"" ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" and ""hang myself at the woods.""
   - Emotional indicators include intense frustration (""Fuckkkkkkk,"" ""I'm so fucking tired of everything"") and a strong desire for death.
   - Specific method and plan are clearly stated: ""hang myself at the woods,"" with the addition of a preparatory element (""I'll play my favorite music ever"").
   - Location is specified (""the woods""), and imminence is indicated with ""tonight.""
   - There is no reference to past actions; the focus is on future intent. The desire to die is explicit and affirmed, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post directly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""hang myself,"" expressing a clear, personal desire to die.
   - No negation or unwanted nature of the thoughts is present; the language is affirmative and urgent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""hang myself"") and location (""the woods"") are mentioned, along with a preparatory step (""play my favorite music ever"").
   - This constitutes explicit planning, leaning the classification toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that occurred).
   - All content is prospective, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a specific method (hanging), location (woods), and preparation (music) moves this beyond 'Ideation' to 'Behavior'.
   - Since no action has been initiated (only planned), it is not 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""I want to kill myself.""  
   - Specific plan/timing: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching.""  
   - Preparations: ""Already started to cancel friendships"" (indicating active steps toward suicide).  
   - Emotional indicators: Loneliness, hopelessness (""truly alone forever,"" ""what a joke"").  
   - No description of past/initiated lethal actions (e.g., no mention of an actual attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, direct phrase: ""I want to kill myself.""  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan**: Specific timeline (""set a date,"" ""approaching"").  
   - **Preparation**: ""Started to cancel friendships"" (tying loose ends).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""approaching"" a set date) and **preparatory actions** (canceling friendships).  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action described (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or overdose).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan (date) + preparations (canceling friendships) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from 'Ideation': Plan/preparation elevates it beyond mere desire.  
   - Distinction from 'Attempt': No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""this life doesn't fit me,"" ""i dont like this shithole""), feeling trapped (""i cant change it""), and anhedonia (""i have to [sleep/waste time] so i dont kill myself"").  
   - **Crucially, the writer states they engage in behaviors (sleeping/wasting time) to *avoid* acting on suicidal thoughts**, framing suicide as an unwanted outcome they are actively resisting.  
   - No specific plan, method, preparation, timeline, or past action is mentioned. The phrase ""Is suicide really as bad..."" reflects abstract questioning, not personal intent or planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: Yes (""kill myself"").  
   - **Desire to die**: No. The writer explicitly frames suicidal thoughts as something they are *avoiding* (""so i dont kill myself""). The rhetorical question (""Is suicide really as bad..."") explores societal views, not personal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions. Focus is on preventing suicide through avoidance behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are mentioned but are **explicitly framed as unwanted and actively resisted** (""i have to [act] so i dont kill myself"").  
   - No desire to die is expressed; instead, the writer questions societal perceptions of suicide abstractly.  
   - Lacks plan/method/preparation or description of concrete actions.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress about life/unwanted suicidal thoughts without personal desire to die.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" twice, indicating a personal desire for death. The phrase ""do it"" refers to committing suicide, as it is directly tied to dying. There is an emotional indicator of despair and self-criticism (""too much of a coward""), but no mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current feelings of inability to act despite the desire. There is no temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer expresses a genuine wish to die but perceives a barrier (cowardice) preventing action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with ""I want to die."" While suicide isn't mentioned verbatim, ""do it"" contextually means suicide. The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, they express frustration at not being able to act on them. This negates leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to ""do it"" is vague and lacks concrete details. Without any explicit plan or method, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current ideation, not past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., taking pills, jumping). The mention of being a ""coward to do it"" implies contemplation but not execution, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post clearly shows a personal desire to die (""I want to die""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit desire or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no described past or recent suicidal action, 'Attempt' is inapplicable. This fits 'Ideation' perfectly: explicit suicidal thoughts/desire without a specific plan or preparatory behavior.

But now i am at peace, no longer in pain, locked in the bathroom while my friends text me endlessly about how im ""ignoring"" them, but in reality i dont have the confidence to even say a word to them knowing it might as well be my last. Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""throw myself off a bridge,"" indicating a specific suicide method. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I cant take it""), despair (""i hated myself and i was tired of everything""), and a sense of burden (""i dont have the confidence to even say a word""). There is also explicit planning (""Ive planned it all out"") and preparation (e.g., locking in the bathroom, the post serving as a ""last vent""). References to past actions include being ""suicidal since i was 9"" and self-harm, but these are historical and not described as initiated suicide attempts. The imminence is suggested (""last few seconds i can ever memorize""), but the action is framed as future-oriented (""before i littitimatly decide""). The writer expresses a clear desire to die (""i dont want to be here"") and appears resolved (""i am at peace"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal"" and ""throw myself off a bridge,"" which are direct phrases indicating suicide. It expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""i dont want to be here"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the writer seems at peace with the decision.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""throw myself off a bridge""), and there is evidence of preparation (""Ive planned it all out""). The context (e.g., locking in the bathroom, the post as a final message) supports this as active planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past suicidal feelings and self-harm but does not detail any past initiated, potentially lethal suicide attempt (self-harm is not equivalent to an attempt unless specified). The focus is on current/future intentions (""before i littitimatly decide,"" ""last few seconds""), with no description of an action that has been started or completed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan/method, ruling out 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire) and 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan). It does not describe a past or recent initiated action (e.g., no mention of having jumped or been interrupted), so 'Attempt' is not applicable. The presence of a plan (""throw myself off a bridge"") and preparation (""planned it all out"") aligns with 'Behavior'.

469,I'm gonna twist my dick off. I'm gonna commit suicide. I can't get a boner but I sure am gonna try here . I'm gonna wait it off a die of blood loss.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit statements: ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" shows direct suicidal intent. The method is described as ""twist my dick off"" to cause death by blood loss, indicating a specific, violent means. Phrases like ""I'm gonna try here"" and ""I'm gonna wait it off and die of blood loss"" suggest imminent action, with ""here"" implying the act may be initiated at the time of posting. There is no mention of past actions, only future intentions. The emotional context is one of despair and hopelessness, tied to a personal issue (inability to get an erection).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes, the post explicitly states ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" and expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""die of blood loss."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; it is presented as a personal intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""twist my dick off"" leading to ""die of blood loss""). The phrase ""I'm gonna try here"" implies preparation or initiation of the act, but it is future-oriented and not described as a completed or past action. This fits the criteria for 'Behavior' due to the explicit plan and method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The language is future-focused (""I'm gonna""), indicating intention rather than a past or completed action. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I did""); instead, it outlines a plan to act. Therefore, it does not meet the threshold for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post expresses a clear desire to die with a specific method, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks personal suicidal intent) or 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). The absence of a described initiated action rules out 'Attempt'. Thus, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a plan and method.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes ""Sayonara"" (meaning ""goodbye""), which could imply farewell, but it's not explicitly tied to suicide. It discusses worsening disease, physical pain, mental depression, loneliness, and a lack of reason to live. The phrase ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" refers to death from illness, not self-inflicted harm. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (""no reason to live"") and despair, but no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. The temporal context is future-oriented (""eventually""), with no references to past suicidal actions or imminent plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar direct phrases (e.g., no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself""). The desire expressed is about enduring suffering and anticipating death from disease, not a personal wish to die by suicide. The phrase ""I have no reason to live"" indicates hopelessness but does not convey an active desire for death; it's more about distress. Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and any death references are attributed to illness, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparation (e.g., writing a note) for suicide is mentioned. The focus is on the natural progression of the disease. Without any suicidal planning elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing suffering and a future outcome (death from disease) but no past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions related to suicide. Statements like ""endured the physical pain"" refer to suffering, not a suicide attempt. Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress, hopelessness, and abstract discussions of death (from illness), but lacks explicit personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions. While phrases like ""no reason to live"" and ""Sayonara"" suggest severe distress, they do not meet the threshold for 'Ideation' (which requires an explicit desire to die by suicide). Given the ambiguity and the rule to choose 'Indicator' when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', this fits 'Indicator'. It does not qualify for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' due to the absence of suicidal planning or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses envy towards people who have died or committed suicide, with thoughts like ""Why can't that be me?"" and explicitly states ""I'll still be suicidal lol."" 
    - It includes emotional indicators of despair (e.g., disappointment that suicide ""isn't so hard"") and self-criticism (""turning me into a bad person"").
    - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for suicide are mentioned. The focus is on persistent suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
    - There is no description of past or recent concrete actions (e.g., attempts), only expressed ongoing ideation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **Yes**: The author explicitly states ""I'll still be suicidal,"" confirming a personal desire to die. The rhetorical ""Why can't that be me?"" further signals a wish not to be alive. The acknowledgment of these thoughts as ""wrong"" does not negate the expressed current desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. The phrase ""killing yourself isn't so hard"" is a general reflection, not a personal plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts (""I'll still be suicidal"") and persistent envy of the dead. No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - The explicit admission of ongoing suicidal thoughts and desire to die (""Why can't that be me?"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.  
    - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
    - No description of initiated self-harm actions rules out **Attempt**.  
    - While distress is present, the explicit personal desire to die distinguishes this from **Indicator**.

Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""wants to die"" and frames fear of hell as ""one of the only things keeping me alive,"" indicating a current desire to die but hesitation due to religious fears.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm probably [going to hell] anyways""), isolation, and guilt.  
   - No specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - Temporal context is ongoing/internal conflict (""I keep worrying,"" ""I’ve been feeling isolated""), not imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author states ""wants to die"" directly and implies suicidal intent is restrained only by fear of hell. The phrase ""keeping me alive"" confirms the desire to die is present but conflicted.  
   - **No** indication that the thoughts are explicitly unwanted (e.g., ""I don’t want these thoughts""). The focus is on barriers (fear), not rejection of the desire itself.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note). The barrier (fear of hell) is abstract, not a logistical deterrent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current** internal conflict, not past actions. References to ""have done some bad shit"" are vague and unrelated to suicidal behavior. No initiated self-harm actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit personal desire to die (""wants to die"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated. Fear of consequences is a common barrier in ideation but doesn’t negate the underlying desire.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, not abstract/unwanted.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of concrete plans, methods, or past/current actions.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I thought of killing myself multiple times"") and current distress (stress, anxiety, hopelessness). 
   - Emotional indicators include despair (""crippled by stress,"" ""no motivation""), isolation, and feeling unheard.
   - There is **no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparation** (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). 
   - The suicidal thoughts are explicitly linked to the past (""thought of killing myself multiple times"") and countered by protective factors (love for brother). Current feelings focus on distress and helplessness but lack active suicidal planning.
   - The phrase ""I don’t know how long I can cope"" expresses overwhelm but not an imminent intent to act.
   - The writer’s desire for suicide is framed as a past thought, not a current intent: ""he is the only reason I’m alive right now"" negates present desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the phrase ""thought of killing myself"" explicitly references suicide. 
   - However, this is qualified as past ideation (""thought,"" ""multiple times""), and the author **explicitly states they do not want to act** due to their brother (""he is the only reason I’m alive""). The current sentiment is distress about their situation, not a stated desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The ideation is described abstractly (""thought of killing myself"") without specifics. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly past (""thought of killing myself multiple times"" over the last 2 years). 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted attempts). The focus is on enduring distress, not initiating self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts are mentioned but framed as **past and unwanted** (countered by the brother). 
   - No plan/method/preparation exists → rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No initiated action → rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - The presence of explicit past suicidal thoughts pushes this beyond general distress alone, but the **lack of current desire to die** (emphasized by the protective factor) and **absence of planning** aligns best with 'Ideation'. The core of the post is current distress with historical suicidal thoughts, not active intent.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions death/dying with phrases like ""how to die"" and ""definitely die,"" indicating a focus on causing one's own death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, as shown by ""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both,"" suggesting a willingness to endure suffering to achieve death.
   - There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan (e.g., location, timing), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). Instead, the post asks ""Where can I find out how to die,"" which implies seeking information but does not describe an existing plan or action.
   - No references to past actions or attempts (e.g., no mention of prior self-harm or suicide attempts).
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the desire is general.
   - The writer's stated desire is clear: ""I just want to definitely die"" expresses a genuine wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""definitely die."" While it doesn't use the word ""suicide,"" the context of ""how to die"" in a personal, first-person narrative strongly implies suicidal intent.
   - The desire is affirmed and not negated (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on this""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The query ""Where can I find out how to die"" indicates an interest in learning about methods but does not constitute an explicit plan or preparation. Seeking information alone, without detailing a method, is insufficient for 'Behavior'.
   - Since there is no clear plan/method, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current desire and inquiry about dying but no past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., no mention of trying something), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to definitely die""), which excludes 'Indicator' (where suicidal desire is absent or unwanted).
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. Seeking information on methods is preparatory but not equivalent to stating a plan; thus, 'Ideation' is more appropriate.
   - No past or recent actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the explicit suicidal thoughts and desire without a plan or action.

I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""will to die"" and explicit suicidal intent (""if I do attempt again"").
   - Expresses hopelessness (""don't want a future""), emotional exhaustion, and detachment from loved ones.
   - Explicitly references a **past suicide attempt** (""if I do attempt again"") and confidence in succeeding next time.
   - States no *current* imminent risk (""not in immediate danger... few months out"") but confirms future intent.
   - No specific method/preparation for future plans mentioned (only vague timelines).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""will to die,"" ""attempt again,"" and ""if I do it"" directly express personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific future plan/method**: References ""plans"" (social commitments) as a delay tactic but no suicidal method/prep details. Future intent (""if I do attempt"") lacks actionable specifics.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - **Past action confirmed**: ""Attempt again"" confirms a prior concrete, self-initiated suicidal act (even if unspecific). This meets 'Attempt' criteria regardless of current timeline/method vagueness.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past suicide attempt (""attempt again"") is explicitly stated, making 'Attempt' mandatory per rules (overrides current ideation/behavior).  
   - Desire to die is present, but the *defining factor* is the description of a prior concrete action.

476,"My temptations will soon get the better of me. Every day the pain gets worse. For the past week, I haven't thought about anything other than how and when I'm going to take my life.

I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop. I'm only 16 and I've gone through enough of it to last multiple lifetimes. I'm too afraid to use any method aside from a gun to the head, though.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""how and when I'm going to take my life,"" ""gun to the head,"" ""grab a kitchen knife and do it there.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""I've fucked everything up,"" ""I don't want any more chances""), despair (""pain gets worse""), anhedonia (""can't see myself going on to live a normal life"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: Mentions ""gun to the head"" as a preferred method and ""kitchen knife"" as an alternative; discusses timeline (""wait another 480 days"") and escalating temptation (""each day I've been more tempted"").  
   - Preparations: References a plan (""Going by my plan"") and access constraints (waiting until age 18 for firearm access).  
   - Imminence: Expresses urgency (""I can't wait any more"") but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""I just want the pain to stop"") with no indication of resisting the urge.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly states ""take my life"" and describes methods.  
   - Yes: Expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""It's peaceful to think about [being] free from everything"").  
   - No negation of desire: Does not state these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods: Explicitly mentions ""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife.""  
   - Preparations: Has a plan involving waiting for legal access to a firearm and considers immediate alternatives.  
   - **Conclusion**: Clear evidence of planning/method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on *future* intent (""I'm going to take my life"") and temptation to act *now* (""tempted to just grab a kitchen knife"").  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator? No**: Explicit personal desire to die and methods discussed.  
   - **Ideation? No**: Goes beyond passive desire; includes specific methods and planning.  
   - **Behavior? Yes**: Suicidal desire + explicit methods (firearm/knife) + preparations (timeline, escalating temptation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but frames them in the context of seeking help (""benefit from inpatient care"").  
   - Expresses distress (feeling unable to concentrate, guilt over past failures) but also **explicitly states a desire to live** (""trying to find the courage to actually live"").  
   - Focuses on recovery steps (inpatient care, medication) and self-affirmation (""convincing myself I deserve to live"").  
   - No references to death/dying as a desired outcome, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but **immediately contextualizes them as unwanted** (seeking treatment to overcome them).  
   - **Explicitly negates desire to die** (""trying to find the courage to actually live"").  
   - **No expression of current personal desire to die or commit suicide**; instead, distress is centered on fighting suicidal thoughts.

I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Nothing to say ever,"" ""No future""), despair (""Everyday is the same""), and feelings of worthlessness (e.g., being unemployed, graying hair).
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""Bridge,"" implying jumping from a bridge as a means.
   - A specific timeframe is stated: ""on Monday,"" indicating imminence but not immediate action.
   - There is no reference to past actions, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or completed attempts.
   - The statement ""I'm really going to try and kill myself"" expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""I'm really going to try..."").
   - No, the writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them; instead, it conveys intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (""Bridge"") is mentioned, which refers to a common suicidal means (jumping).
   - No explicit preparations are described (e.g., acquiring tools or writing a note), but the method is clearly stated.
   - The presence of a method shifts this toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""on Monday""), not a past or recent action.
   - There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., a past attempt). The focus is solely on planned future behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and mention of suicide (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no personal suicidal desire.
   - The presence of a specific method (""Bridge"") means this cannot be 'Ideation', as 'Ideation' is defined by the absence of a plan or method.
   - Since no past or recent initiated action is described (e.g., an attempt was made), 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The combination of suicidal intent and a stated method aligns with 'Behavior', as the definition includes expressions of desire plus a plan or method (even if brief).
   - No ambiguity about the method exists; ""Bridge"" is explicit, so 'Behavior' is appropriate over 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit references to suicide, such as ""kms"" (kill myself), ""when I do it"" (referring to suicide), and ""before I go"" (implying death). It mentions a specific method (""hangman's noose"") and preparations like setting the wallpaper as a reminder and overcoming a hurdle to facilitate suicide (ensuring the mother's security). Emotional indicators include distress (""so hard,"" ""hardest decisions""), but the core focus is on suicidal intent and planning. There is no description of a past initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of an actual attempt); actions like changing the wallpaper or overcoming hurdles are preparatory, not attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kms"" multiple times and phrases like ""when I do it,"" indicating a personal desire to die. There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., no ""I don't want to die""); instead, the conflict is about timing or relationships, not the desire itself.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""hangman's noose""). Preparations are evident: setting the wallpaper ""to stay on track"" (a behavioral cue for suicide) and ""overcame a big hurdle to kms"" (logistical planning, such as ensuring the mother's situation). This indicates planning beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past actions (e.g., setting/changing wallpaper, overcoming a hurdle) but no initiated lethal action. ""Overcame a big hurdle"" is preparatory, not an attempt (e.g., no description of ingesting pills or other lethal means). Intentions are future-oriented (""when I do it"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""kms"") and specific method/preparation (noose, hurdle resolution) align with 'Behavior'. There is no past lethal action for 'Attempt', and the presence of planning rules out 'Ideation'. The strong suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains phrases expressing intense distress: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born,"" and ""I don't want to be me anymore.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""adulthood is all downhill""), despair (""I haven't been happy in 2 years""), and self-loathing (""I’m a failure"").  
   - **Crucially**, the author explicitly states: ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore,"" indicating the suicidal thought (""I want to die"") is *unwanted* and not a genuine current desire to act.  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrase ""I want to die"" is present (Yes).  
   - However, the author *immediately negates* genuine intent: ""I don't want to die,"" framing the suicidal thought as distressing but undesired. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core conflict is distress about *unwanted* suicidal thoughts (""I don't want to die"") rather than active desire to act.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'/'Attempt'.  
   - The plea for help (""someone please help me"") underscores distress without intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: Falls under 'Indicator' due to explicit negation of suicidal desire despite mentioning suicidal thoughts.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions multiple past suicide attempts: overdose at 15, firearm incident at 21, hanging attempt recently.  
   - Describes current suicide preparation: ""exit bag set up"" with gas, testing it (turning gas on/off), and ensuring method is ""surefire.""  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""lifelong depression,"" ""desire to die,"" and detailing methods.  
   - Emotional indicators: loneliness, exhaustion, numbness, fear of failure, regret over pushing people away.  
   - Recent initiated action: Turning on the gas valve for the exit bag before panicking and stopping.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" and recounting past attempts confirm personal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific current method (""exit bag""), preparations (""set up,"" testing gas valve), and references to past methods (aspirin, gun, rope).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past attempts** (overdose, firearm, hanging) and **recent initiated action**: Turning on the gas for the exit bag, which was self-interrupted. This qualifies as a potentially lethal act initiated ""just recently.""  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details concrete, past suicidal actions (overdose, firearm, hanging) meeting 'Attempt' criteria.  
   - The **most recent event** (initiating gas for the exit bag) is a self-interrupted but potentially lethal action, further cementing 'Attempt'.  
   - Despite current distress and ambivalence (""scared of dying""), the description of initiated actions takes precedence over plans/preparations.  
   - Rule: If past/recent concrete actions exist, 'Attempt' supersedes 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" which directly references suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile""), feelings of worthlessness (""I'm a garbage person""), and perceived burden (""for the benefit of those around me,"" ""I'm just a leech"").
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - The desire to die is stated as a personal solution (""should just end my life""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""end my life,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die for perceived benefits (e.g., ""for my benefit and the benefit of those around me"").
   - No, there is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The phrase ""end my life"" is general and lacks concrete planning details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current/future intention but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started and stopped).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses an explicit personal desire to die (""end my life""), moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - However, there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - Since no past or recent initiated action is described, it cannot be classified as 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the content aligns with 'Ideation', defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire to die without a specific plan or preparations.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly states ""I'm about to kill myself,"" indicating a direct mention of suicide. Emotional indicators include ""I don't see a reason to live"" (hopelessness) and ""Life sucks"" (despair). There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The phrase ""about to"" suggests imminence but does not detail a plan. The writer expresses a clear desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I don't see a reason to live"").
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or not to be acted on; the desire is genuine and current.
   - This does not lean toward 'Indicator' due to the explicit personal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks details like ""overdose on pills"" or ""jump from a bridge.""
   - Since there is a desire to die but no explicit plan, method, or preparation, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm about to"") but does not reference any past actions or initiated behaviors (e.g., no description of a prior attempt or interrupted action).
   - There is no mention of a concrete, potentially lethal action that has been carried out; it is solely forward-looking.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire but no plan, method, or preparation, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The clear personal expression of suicidal intent rules out 'Indicator', which requires ambiguity about desire or unwanted thoughts.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it involves explicit thoughts and desire to die without a specific plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""face death"" and implies potential death with ""if not, well, you know what happened."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm done,"" ""don't even want to feel good anymore,"" ""embrace the pain""). There is a specific plan: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" starting immediately, with a 12-hour timeline. No references to past actions. Imminence is clear (""now gonna start,"" 12-hour window). The writer expresses a willingness to confront death, but there's no explicit statement of not wanting these thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it directly references death (""face death"") and implies a desire for death through the risky behavior. There is no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""), so the desire appears genuine.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""working out until i die or pass out,"" which is a potentially lethal means (e.g., through overexertion). Preparations are indicated by the immediate initiation (""now gonna start"") and the 12-hour timeline. This shows planning and method, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""now gonna start"") and no past or initiated action. It is not a description of a completed or interrupted act, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The writer expresses a personal desire to die (through ""face death"" and the context), moving this beyond 'Indicator'. With a specific method (intense working out to the point of death) and preparations (immediate start, timeline), it fits 'Behavior'. It is not 'Ideation' because a plan/method is present, and not 'Attempt' as no action has been initiated yet.

I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""contemplated suicide for years"" and states ""I know I am going to do it,"" indicating a personal desire to die. There is emotional distress related to hopelessness about the future (e.g., questioning retirement savings due to planned early death). No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, guns, notes, or goodbyes). The timeline is vague and non-imminent (""maybe in my 20's or 30's""). The author expresses a desire to experience more before acting, but this does not negate the underlying intent to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I know I am going to do it""). There is no statement indicating that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not intend to act on them; instead, the desire is affirmed as part of future plans.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The discussion about retirement planning is contextual but does not constitute a plan or preparation for suicide. The timeline is uncertain, and the author focuses on life experiences before acting, but this lacks concrete suicidal planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past contemplation (""for years"") and future intentions (""I know I am going to do it"" with a vague timeline in 20s or 30s). There is no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, aborted actions, or outcomes like hospitalization). The content is solely about thoughts and intentions, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die, which rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so it cannot be classified as 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and a stated intention to act, but without details on how, when, or where it will be carried out.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post asks ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" which implies interest in the lethality of the medication, potentially for self-harm.
   - It mentions possessing pills (""I have a few pills"") and saving them for later, indicating preparation and access to a specific method (overdose).
   - No explicit emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness, despair) is stated, but the context suggests potential suicidal intent.
   - The phrase ""saving for later"" implies future intent, but no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.
   - There is no mention of past actions, desire for death being unwanted, or explicit negation of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or express a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). The question about lethality is indirect, so explicit intent is not confirmed. This leans away from 'Ideation' due to lack of direct expression.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (duloxetine pills for potential overdose) is mentioned.
   - Preparations are indicated by possessing and saving the pills ""for later,"" suggesting intent for future use.
   - This presence of method and preparation aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses current possession and future intent (""saving for later""), but no past or recent initiated action (e.g., an attempt) is described. It is preparatory, not active.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The lack of explicit personal desire to die rules out 'Ideation' as the primary category.
   - The mention of a specific method (pills) and preparation (saving them) strongly supports 'Behavior,' as this involves planning elements.
   - No concrete past action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - 'Indicator' is not the best fit because the post goes beyond general distress; it includes method and preparation, which elevate it to 'Behavior' despite the indirect expression of intent.
   - Applying the rule: If a plan/method is present, consider 'Behavior'. Since pills are a specific method and saving them is preparation, 'Behavior' is appropriate.

I just want to end but haven't yet.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses emotional distress with phrases like ""I really need to stop feeling this way,"" ""It's hell,"" and ""I feel so empire"" (likely a typo for ""empty""). There is hopelessness (""If anyone or anything truly cared about my life I know it isn't me"") and a sense of isolation (""out of place with everyone""). The key phrase ""I just want to end but haven't yet"" suggests a desire to end suffering or life, but it is vague and not explicitly tied to suicide or death. No specific methods, tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. There are no references to past actions or attempts, and no temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The author's stated desire focuses on distress and a wish to stop feeling this way, rather than a clear, personal craving for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct equivalents. The phrase ""I just want to end"" is ambiguous—it could imply ending life but is not definitive (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). The author does not express a clear, current desire to die; instead, the emphasis is on emotional pain and the struggle to cope. There is no statement negating or rejecting suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I don't want to act on it""), but since suicide is not explicitly mentioned, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations are described. The phrase ""haven't yet"" implies inaction, not planning or preparation. Without any concrete suicidal elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, not past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., an overdose or self-harm), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The primary content is general distress, hopelessness, and a vague wish to ""end"" without explicit suicidal desire or intent. While ""I just want to end"" hints at ideation, it is not a clear expression of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), and there is no plan or method. Given the ambiguity and focus on emotional suffering, this aligns with 'Indicator'. Per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to uncertainty about genuine suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen.

But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions death/suicide explicitly with phrases like ""I could be dead by the end of the day"" and ""I cant off myself,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts. It references a specific method (""buy the gas""), which implies a means for suicide (e.g., carbon monoxide poisoning). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., discussing procrastination and fatigue as barriers) and a sense of internal conflict (""My brain is my body's worst enemy""). There are no signs of preparation (e.g., no note written, gas not acquired) or past actions; the focus is on current thoughts and hypothetical scenarios. The temporal context is future-oriented but conditional (""if I never leave the house""), with no imminent action described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide with ""off myself"" and expresses a desire to die through ""I could be dead by the end of the day,"" framed in a context of despair. The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or negate the desire to die; instead, barriers like fatigue prevent action.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""buy the gas""), which is a clear reference to acquiring means for suicide. However, no actual preparations (e.g., purchasing gas) are described—it's hypothetical and not acted upon due to procrastination.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions (""could be dead by the end of the day"") but no past or recent initiated actions. Everything is contingent on overcoming barriers, with no evidence of concrete, lethal actions being taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit suicidal desire (""off myself"") and specific method (""gas"") move this beyond 'Indicator' (which would apply if suicidal thoughts were unwanted or abstract). The mention of a method qualifies it as 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). There is no description of an initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Even though the method is not acted upon, the brief mention of a specific means fits the 'Behavior' definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and uses phrases like ""do it"" and ""do it already"" to refer to committing suicide, indicating personal involvement.
   - Emotional indicators include self-criticism (""stop being a pussy,"" ""suck it up"") and urgency (""do it already""), suggesting frustration and a push toward action.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - References to past actions are limited to posting about suicide (""I post about suicide constantly""), which is not a suicidal act but a discussion of ideation.
   - Imminence is implied with ""do it already"" but lacks a concrete timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I should just suck it up and do it already"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and uses direct phrases like ""do it"" in a suicidal context.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""do it already"").
   - No, the writer does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; instead, they express self-criticism for not acting.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I should... do it"") but describes no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. The mention of ""post about suicide constantly"" refers to verbal expression, not a concrete suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die with explicit suicidal intent, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no genuine desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The content fits 'Ideation' due to the explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.

I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions past self-harm (""I started to cut my rights leg... to calm me down"") and detailed plans for suicide, including specific methods (""hang myself,"" ""cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe""), location (""in the highest tree of the forest""), and preparations (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). It describes a past plan (""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"") that was not acted on, and a current plan with imminent intent (""it's time to stop the lie and end it""). Emotional indicators include feelings of being ""done with everything,"" ""unmotivated,"" and a persistent ""weird feeling,"" but the author states they are ""not sad or depress"" and feel ""happy"" in a detached way. There is a clear, current desire to die, with no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and ""end it,"" indicating a direct and personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the author expresses resolve to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods (hanging, using an axe) and location (forest) are mentioned. Preparations are explicitly stated as complete (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""), indicating the author has acquired the means and is ready to carry out the plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") that was not initiated (""But I didn't""), so there is no past suicidal action. The self-harm (cutting) is presented as a coping mechanism, not a suicide attempt. The current content focuses on future intentions (""I plan to hang myself"") with preparations in place, but no initiated lethal action has occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses explicit desire to die and has a specific plan, method, and preparations, ruling out 'Indicator' (no clear desire) and 'Ideation' (no plan/method). There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was interrupted or failed), so it does not meet the 'Attempt' criteria. The presence of current suicidal thoughts with a concrete plan and preparations aligns with 'Behavior'.

We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses existential despair and hopelessness about the meaning of life (e.g., ""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"" and ""there still is no point for us being here""). 
   - It includes a direct personal statement: ""I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die,"" which explicitly negates a desire for death or suicide. 
   - No mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). 
   - No references to past actions or attempts. 
   - The tone is philosophical and distressed, with no indication of imminent plans (e.g., words like ""tonight"" or ""soon"" are absent). 
   - The writer's stated desire is clear: distress about life's pointlessness, but an explicit rejection of wanting to die (""don't really want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent direct phrases. 
   - While it discusses death abstractly, the writer personally states they ""don't really want to die,"" indicating no genuine current desire for death. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly present; instead, the distress centers on existential questions, with any death-related content framed as unwanted or hypothetical.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. 
   - The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and philosophical thoughts, not past events or actions. 
   - No description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no reference to a past attempt or recent behavior), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal, current expression of suicidal desire. The explicit statement ""don't really want to die"" confirms that any death-related thoughts are unwanted, aligning with 'Indicator'. 
   - There is no evidence of suicidal ideation (desire to die), as the writer negates this intent. 
   - No plan, method, or preparation is present, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' cannot apply. 
   - Given the ambiguity rule (choose 'Indicator' if uncertain between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'), and the clear negation of death desire, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense shame and anxiety about a personal incident (buying a used sex toy) and resulting social humiliation. The author fears judgment at a new school. Key elements include:
   - Emotional indicators: Shame (""very ashamed""), regret (""messed up big time""), anxiety (""afraid of what everyone will think"").
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.
   - The core focus is distress about social perception and seeking advice (""What do I do?"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""
   - **No implied desire to die** – the tone is focused on coping with shame/social fallout, not escaping life.
   - **No mention of suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No references to suicide plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Discusses **past events** (buying the item, being mocked) and **future fears** (starting school). 
   - **No description** of past or recent self-initiated suicidal/self-harm actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows **general distress** (shame, anxiety, regret) but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, ideation, plan, or past attempt**. 
   - The author seeks solutions (""What do I do?""), indicating distress without suicidal intent. 
   - **No ambiguity** pushes it toward Ideation; it squarely fits **'Indicator'** (distress without suicidal intent/expression).

494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses anger towards families for preventing suicide, with key phrases like ""dont let you kill yourself"" and ""want me to suffer."" It explicitly mentions suicide (""kill yourself"") and implies a personal desire to die to end suffering. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""sick of it""), despair (""suffer""), and feeling like a burden (""for your well being and your pleasure""). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or locations. No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current frustration and the desire to die being blocked by others. No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight"") suggest imminence. The writer's stated desire appears genuine (e.g., wanting to kill oneself to stop suffering), with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" in a personal context (using ""you"" to refer to the author), and it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., through the rhetorical question about suffering). There is no statement negating or rejecting the suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this""). This confirms explicit suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The frustration is about being prevented from suicide in general, but no details on how or when it would be carried out. Without any plan-related elements, this aligns with 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and desires, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no phrases like ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). It focuses on the present inability to act due to family intervention, not on any initiated behavior. This absence of action rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows explicit personal suicidal desire (""kill yourself"" and suffering context) but lacks any plan, method, or preparation, fitting the 'Ideation' definition. It does not meet 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no initiated action). Although distress is present, the clear suicidal intent differentiates it from 'Indicator'.

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions emotional distress: loneliness (""am i lonely""), feeling uncared for (""nobody fucking cares""), self-loathing (""spoiled piece of shit"").
   - Expresses a desire for death: ""pls fucking end me before the day"" is a direct plea for death.
   - References suicidal intent: ""nobody cares till i say im going to do it"" implies past threats of suicide (""do it"") to gain attention, but does not describe a specific plan, method, preparation, or past action.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").
   - Temporal context: ""before the day"" suggests urgency but lacks concrete imminence or action initiation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""im going to do it"" implies suicidal intent (with ""do it"" contextually meaning suicide), and ""pls fucking end me"" explicitly expresses a desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no tools, substances, locations, or preparatory acts like writing a note).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes emotional state and a desire for death but no initiated action (past or present). The phrase ""im going to do it"" refers to verbal threats, not physical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die (""end me"") and suicidal intent (""do it"") place this beyond **Indicator**.
   - No plan, method, or preparations mentioned, ruling out **Behavior**.
   - No description of a past/recent initiated action (e.g., ""I tried""), ruling out **Attempt**.
   - Fits **Ideation**: clear personal desire to die/suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or action.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions stabbings in the area and expresses a hope to be the next victim (""I hope it'll be me next""). It references suicide indirectly by contrasting it with being a stabbing victim to avoid family shame (""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide""). There is an emotional indicator of despair and hopelessness, as well as a sense of being a burden (avoiding shame for the family). However, there is no mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation for self-harm or suicide. The desire for death is expressed passively through hoping for an external event (a stabbing) rather than self-initiated action. No past actions or attempts are described, and the temporal context is future-oriented but vague (""next"" without imminence like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses the word ""suicide,"" but it is framed as an undesirable outcome due to shame, not as a current personal desire to act. However, the phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" expresses a clear personal desire to die (to not be alive), even if through external means. There is no statement indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no negation like ""I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned for carrying out self-harm or suicide. The reference to stabbing is a hope for victimization by an external event, not a plan the author is formulating or preparing for (e.g., no indication of seeking out a dangerous situation or acquiring means). Therefore, there is no evidence of behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future hope (""I hope it'll be me next"") with no reference to past or recent self-initiated actions. It does not describe any concrete, potentially lethal action that was initiated by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a clear personal desire to die (""I hope it'll be me next""), which aligns with suicidal ideation. However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out Behavior. The mention of suicide is contextual (to contrast with the preferred outcome of being stabbed) but does not indicate current intent or planning for self-inflicted harm. Since the desire to die is explicit and personal, and there is no ambiguity about unwanted thoughts, this is not merely an Indicator (which would involve distress without suicidal desire). There is no past action described, so Attempt does not apply. Thus, the best fit is Ideation.

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Explicit phrases: ""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all,"" ""kill myself with peace.""
    - Emotional indicators: Despair (""0 friends,"" ""no skills,"" ""no job,"" ""no money""), hopelessness (""something blocking me"").
    - Plan/Method: Mentions disappearing (changing identity, moving countries) as preparation to enable suicide. References suicide as an ""accident,"" implying method concealment.
    - Preparations: Actively strategizing how to avoid detection (""run from everyone,"" ""disappear,"" ""no one knowing"").
    - Imminence: No immediate timeline, but strong desire expressed (""I want to put an end to it all"").
    - Stated desire: Clear personal wish to die (""killmyself,"" ""put an end to it all"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes: ""killmyself,"" ""kill myself,"" ""put an end to it all."" Desire is affirmed, not negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Yes: Specific plan to ""disappear"" (change identity/country) to facilitate suicide and avoid discovery. Mentions method concealment (""accident"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes future intentions (""how to run,"" ""how can I just disappear"") and hypothetical actions. No past or recent initiated lethal action described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit desire to die (suicidal intent) → Rules out 'Indicator'.
    - Mentions detailed preparations (disappearing, changing identity/location) to enable suicide → Constitutes 'Behavior'.
    - No description of a past/initiated suicidal act → Rules out 'Attempt'.

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions a specific past action: ""tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"" and describes the outcome (failed due to involuntary breathing).  
   - Expresses explicit desire to die: ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"" and ""THIS NEEDS TO END!""  
   - States imminent future plans: ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" and mentions ""another plan in mind"" (Plan B) with details about method/pain.  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration (""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), hopelessness (""Unfortunately, I'm still alive""), and fixation on dying.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases include ""tried to kill myself,"" ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED,"" ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL,"" and ""gonna try again tonight."" Desire to die is unequivocal.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Past method is detailed (""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag""). Future plans include a specific method for ""tonight"" and a backup ""Plan B"" (though not detailed, its existence implies preparation).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past, concrete, potentially lethal action**: The suffocation attempt was initiated and nearly completed (""ALMOST FUCKING DIED"") but failed due to involuntary breathing.  
   - Also describes future intent (""gonna try again tonight"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core focus is the **past action**: The detailed description of a self-initiated, potentially lethal attempt (""tried to kill myself last night"") meets the 'Attempt' criteria.  
   - Rules state: ""If a past attempt is mentioned alongside current ideation/behavior, 'Attempt' takes precedence if the past action was concrete and potentially lethal."" Here, the suffocation attempt was both.  
   - Future plans (""tonight,"" ""Plan B"") would typically suggest 'Behavior,' but the explicit description of a recent, initiated lethal action overrides this per the rules.

499,"Just don't want to get out of bed. I've got a lot to be happy about right now, I'm playing rugby with a very inclusive team, I'm starting my second year at uni in 3 weeks, I have an amazing bf and an awesome best friend and I'm 4 months on hrt . I'm just soooo tierd, I just want to sleep 24/7, I feel empty and I'm worried about ruining my friendships due to another depressive episode 😔",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions feeling tired (""soooo tired,"" ""want to sleep 24/7""), emptiness (""feel empty""), and worry about ruining friendships due to a depressive episode. It also lists positive aspects of life (rugby, university, relationships, HRT progress), indicating mixed emotions but no references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair is implied through feelings of emptiness and fatigue, and there's a fear of burdening relationships (""worried about ruining my friendships""). However, hopelessness is not explicitly stated, and the author acknowledges positive factors, suggesting distress rather than a desire to die.
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no notes, acquiring means, or timelines).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts; the depressive episode is mentioned as a concern, but not linked to any self-initiated lethal behavior.
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") related to suicidal intent; the focus is on current emotional state.
   - The writer expresses distress about a depressive episode but no genuine wish to die; instead, there's an underlying concern about maintaining relationships and life stability.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are absent; ""want to sleep 24/7"" relates to fatigue, not death).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there's no statement about them being unwanted. The primary sentiment is distress about depression and relationships, not suicidal ideation.
   - Leaning toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide method, tool, substance, or location.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - Without any plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'; it lacks the required explicit planning element.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (tiredness, emptiness, worry) and references a potential future depressive episode, but no past or recent suicidal actions are described (e.g., no mention of attempts, even interrupted ones).
   - The concern about ""another depressive episode"" implies historical mental health struggles but not concrete suicidal actions; it remains in the realm of emotional distress.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress and depressive symptoms without any personal expression of suicidal thoughts or desire to die, fitting 'Indicator' (e.g., distress about life impacts, but no suicidal intent).
   - There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit desire to die) or higher categories like 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action). The worry about friendships and depressive episodes aligns with 'Indicator' as it reflects abstract distress.
   - Rules applied: Focus is solely on the author; no ambiguity about suicidal desire exists, so 'Indicator' is appropriate.
