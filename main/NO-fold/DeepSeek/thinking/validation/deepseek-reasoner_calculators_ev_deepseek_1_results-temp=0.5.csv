0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""ending my life""  
   - Specific method/location: ""go to a bridge and jump off""  
   - Emotional markers: hopelessness (""never will find love""), worthlessness (""everything in my life is crap""), self-hatred (""hate being myself"")  
   - Preparatory language: ""want to go to a bridge"" (scouting/planning)  
   - Past reference: ""again"" implies recurrence but no explicit past *action* described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" shows ownership of intent.  
   - No rejection or disavowal (""but I won't"" is absent).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future intent: ""thinking about ending my life again"" and ""want to go"" imply active consideration.  
   - No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but concrete method/location specified.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt described → not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""ending my life"") + specific method/preparation (""go to a bridge and jump off"") → triggers BEHAVIOR per rules (method specification overcomes lack of immediacy).  
   - Not downgraded to IDEATION due to actionable planning (bridge/jumping).  
</thinking>  
Final Classification: **behavior**  

*Rationale*: The post expresses active suicidal desire (""ending my life"") paired with a specific plan (""go to a bridge and jump off""), satisfying the BEHAVIOR threshold per the framework. While no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated, the irreducible rules specify that method/preparation evidence alone qualifies. Emotional distress and past ideation (""again"") are secondary to the actionable plan.",ideation,True
1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (""die"" is not explicitly suicidal; context is distress).  
   - Indirect death references: ""going to die soon"" (implied but non-specific).  
   - Emotional markers: ""inconsolable"" (distress/hopelessness).  
   - Methods/preparations: None.  
   - Past actions: None.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active ownership of suicidal intent (""going to die"" is predictive, not volitional).  
   - No rejection noted, but no suicidal desire expressed.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Vague future reference (""soon""), lacking immediacy.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → rules out ATTEMPT.  
   - No explicit suicidal desire/method/immediacy → rules out BEHAVIOR/IDEATION.  
   - Distress + metaphorical death reference without actionable intent → INDICATOR per rules.  
   - *Key Clarification Applied*: ""I’m going to die soon"" without suicide context → INDICATOR.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (""hate living"" ≠ active death wish)  
   - Indirect death references: None  
   - Emotional markers: Strong despair (""I hate living""), existential frustration (""why I have to live"")  
   - Methods/preparations: Absent  
   - Past actions: Absent  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No ownership of suicidal thoughts. Distress focuses on resentment about existence (""live until now just because two person fucked""), not active desire to die.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present-focused distress without future suicide plans.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → (a) not triggered  
   - No explicit suicide intent → skips (b)/(c)  
   - Core content: Existential despair (""hate living"") + metaphorical origin complaint → falls under (d) INDICATOR  

Key Clarifications Applied:  
- ""Hate living"" reflects hopelessness without actionable suicidal desire.  
- Frustration about life's origin is metaphorical distress.  
- No rejection needed (no suicidal thoughts to reject).

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""kill myself""  
   - Specific method: Request for ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" (a known suicide drug)  
   - Preparation evidence: Actively seeking means (""help me find"")  
   - No emotional markers, indirect references, or past actions noted.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Direct ownership (""Help me kill myself"")  
   - No rejection: Plea for assistance, no disavowal of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: Urgent plea (""Help me"") implies immediacy.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   → No past attempt described (rules out ""attempt"").  
   → Explicit intent (""kill myself"") + specific method (barbiturates) + preparation (seeking drugs) → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   → Immediacy (""Help me"" as urgent call to action) reinforces this.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:  
- Writer-focused: Post is about self.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt mentioned.  
- Immediacy: Urgency overrides non-specific ideation.  
- No rejection to downgrade.

I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired.

   - Emotional markers: ""struggling"", ""unmotivated"", ""selfish"", ""world scares me"", ""fear intimacy"", ""worthless"", ""tired"".  
   - Methods/preparations: None. Asks ""how to die"" hypothetically but no actionable details.  
   - Past actions: None.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Passive experience: ""Is there a painless way to die"" is a hypothetical question, not ownership. ""Want to sleep forever"" is metaphorical.  
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal of suicide, but no endorsement either.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past: Unemployed status, pandemic impact (historical context).  
   - Present: Describes current feelings (""currently unemployed"", ""I'm tired"").  
   - Future: Non-specific (""want to sleep forever"" – metaphorical, no timeline).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - → a) No past attempt described.  
   - → b) No explicit intent + no method/preparation/immediacy.  
   - → c) ""Want to sleep forever"" is metaphorical, not explicit active desire to die by suicide.  
   - → d) **INDICATOR**: Distress (""struggling"", ""worthless"") + metaphors (""sleep forever"") + no actionable suicidal desire.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""Painless way to die"" is a general question (indicator per framework).  
- ""Want to sleep forever"" is metaphorical hopelessness, not actionable ideation.

   - No indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I just wanna die,"" ""It's the best for me"") without presenting them as intrusive or passive.  
   - No rejection noted: The statement is affirmed, not disavowed (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself,"" ""want to die now,"" ""erase all traces of my existence.""  
   - Indirect death references: ""call it a day"" (metaphorical).  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""stuck, stagnant,"" ""damaged""), worthlessness (""everyone better without me""), isolation (""no space for me"").  
   - Specific methods: ""run towards a cop with a knife,"" ""find a dealer with some opioids.""  
   - Preparations: Considering methods (opioids/cop confrontation), though not enacted yet.  
   - Past actions: References 5–6 years of suffering but no described suicide attempt.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Strong ownership (""I want to die now,"" ""I’d go for it [button]"").  
   - **Rejection noted?**: No disavowal. The absence of a ""button"" frustrates intent but doesn’t reject the desire.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - **Present intent**: ""want to die now, right now in this instant"" + immediate method speculation (knife/opioids).  
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing in some phrases (e.g., ""call it a day"").  
   - **Key temporal takeaway**: Immediacy (""now"") dominates.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""get it over with"" (common suicide idiom) + ""go through with it"" (implies suicidal action).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""deteriorating""), isolation (""can't tell anyone""), fear of institutionalization.  
   - Method consideration: Expresses fear about pain/duration of suicide method (""how much it will hurt"").  
   - **No** specific method, preparations, past attempts, or immediate timeline.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I just want to get it over with"" shows ownership of desire.  
   - **No rejection**: Fear of pain ≠ disavowal of intent (""I refuse to be sent... hospital"" relates to coercion, not suicide rejection).

I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. The post contains phrases like ""I'd leave myself if I could,"" but this is metaphorical and not a direct reference to suicide (e.g., no use of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live"").
- **Indirect death references**: None. While ""I'd leave myself if I could"" implies a desire to escape, it is framed metaphorically (similar to ""want to disappear"") rather than referencing death (e.g., no ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong presence of hopelessness (""no one sticks around,"" ""everyone leaves you eventually,"" ""it still hurts"") and worthlessness (""maybe it's me?""). The writer expresses emotional pain and despair related to abandonment and self-isolation.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, hanging, jumping, or firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or ""overdosed""). References to past events are solely about interpersonal experiences (e.g., people leaving).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is conditional and metaphorical, expressing a wish to escape emotional pain rather than an active desire to die.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described. The thoughts focus on relational patterns (e.g., ""I always think... 'when will they leave?'"") without any suicidal content.
- **Rejection noted**: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are presented for disavowal. The writer reflects on self-blame and emotional coping (""I push people away"") but does not reject suicidal ideation because none is expressed.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Dominant, with descriptions of historical relationship patterns (e.g., ""in my experience no one sticks around,"" ""the ones who promised they would stay"").
- **Present intent**: None. The writer describes current feelings of hurt and resignation but no immediate plans for self-harm or suicide.
- **Future ideation**: None. No expressions of suicidal desire, whether specific or non-specific (e.g., no ""someday I won't be here"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past suicide attempt described?** → No, only interpersonal history is mentioned. → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** → No explicit suicide intent, no methods, no preparations, no immediate timeline. → Not BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die (e.g., no ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live""). Metaphorical escape (""leave myself"") lacks actionable suicidal desire. → Not IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post shows general distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphorical references (""I'd leave myself if I could""), and no suicidal thoughts to reject. → INDICATOR.

### Category Alignment
- **Indicator** fits: The post contains distress (e.g., hopelessness about relationships, self-blame), metaphorical expressions (""leave myself""), and no active suicidal desire. Per clarification, ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is a metaphorical escape reference without explicit suicide context, falling under indicator.
- **Irreducible Rules Compliance**:
  1. Writer-focused: Only the writer's feelings are analyzed; mentions of others leaving are contextual.
  2. Temporal hierarchy: Not triggered (no attempt, behavior, or ideation).
  3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
  4. Rejection downgrade: No suicidal thoughts to downgrade.
  5. Single output: Indicator is selected.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Direct ownership of plan (""I plan to kill myself"").  
   - No passive framing (e.g., ""thoughts tell me"") or explicit disavowal. The phrase ""whether I want to or not"" implies compulsion but does not reject intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

   - Explicit intent (""plan to kill myself"") + future timeline (""at 21"") → **No immediacy or specific method/preparation** → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - Explicit suicide desire (""plan to kill myself"") without plan/immediacy → IDEATION.  
   - Distress/hopelessness present but overruled by explicit suicidal desire.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
   - Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.  
   - Temporal hierarchy: Future ideation (no attempt/behavior).  
   - Immediacy absent: ""at 21"" is not imminent.

   - Emotional markers: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence""), worthlessness (""I don't like anything about myself""), and unbearable pain (""sick and tired of crying myself to sleep every night"").
   - Specific methods: No mention of pills, hanging, or other means.
   - Preparations: None; social media deactivation and isolation are general distress signs, not suicide-specific preparations.
   - Past actions: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer actively claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I want to die.""
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the expression is direct.
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal with ""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon,"" downgrading the intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No references to past actions.
   - Present intent: Rejected (""not any time soon"").
   - Future ideation: Vague timing with ""given myself 5 more years,"" but this is conditional and non-actionable due to the rejection.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent present, but no specific method/preparation and no immediacy (rejected with ""not any time soon"") → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""I want to die"") without plan or immediacy, but rejection downgrades per Rule 4 → Not IDEATION (due to downgrade).
   - d) Distress (e.g., hopelessness, worthlessness) and rejected thoughts (""I am not going to kill myself"") → INDICATOR. The expression ""I want to die"" is countered by disavowal, fitting the indicator clarification for rejected thoughts.

Final classification is INDICATOR, as the rejection downgrades the expressed desire, and there is no evidence of actionable intent, plan, or past attempt.

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive.

- **Past actions**: None (self-harm attempts not mentioned)  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
- **Active endorsement**: Explicit ownership (""I feel like the only way out is suicide"").  
- **Passive experience/rejection**: Strong disavowal (""I don't have the guts to do it"", ""I can't seem to go through with it"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
- **Past**: References to job struggles, but no past suicide actions.  
- **Present**: Describes current distress but no immediate plan.  
- **Future**: Non-specific ideation (""should make my escape"" with no timeline).  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
- → a) **No described past attempt** → Proceed.

   - Explicit suicide reference: ""going to kill myself""  
   - Preparation evidence: ""got my suicidal notes ready""  
   - Timeline cue: ""ain't no way I'm doing this shit for another year"" (implies intent within <12 months)

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I’ve decided on it"" shows ownership.  
   - No passive framing or rejection.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent with non-immediate timing (""matter of when/how"") but constrained timeframe (<1 year).  
   - Preparation (notes) is current.

   - No methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.  
   - Core desire: **transformative escape** (""wish I could press a button and be someone else""), not death.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Distress is internally focused (self-loathing) but **lacks active suicidal ownership**.

   - Emotional markers: None (author discusses others' motivations, not personal distress)
   - Methods/preparations: None described for the author
   - Past actions: None claimed by the author
   - **Crucial note**: All suicide references are hypothetical/third-person (""anyone that posts""), discussing others' behavior.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **No active endorsement** of personal suicidal thoughts. The author questions others' motives.
   - **Explicit rejection**: States posters ""aren't really wanting to hurt themselves"" and are ""looking for help"".

### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""killing myself"" and ""I don't want to be alive,"" which are direct expressions of suicidal desire.
- **Indirect death references**: None present; all references are explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness and worthlessness are evident in phrases like ""I don't want to be alive"" and self-deprecating language (""beta male pussy"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer directly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""killing myself,"" ""I don't want to be alive""), with no indication these are passive or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting thoughts are unwanted or external (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted?**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts; the statement ""I don't really care"" reinforces acceptance.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to historical actions or attempts.
- **Present intent**: Statements like ""killing myself"" and ""I don't want to be alive"" indicate current suicidal desire, but no specific timing (e.g., ""tonight"") is provided.
- **Future ideation**: Desire is expressed non-specifically (no plan or timeline).

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start → 
  - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) Explicit suicide intent is present (""killing myself,"" ""don't want to be alive""), but no specific method/preparation or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
  - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
  - d) Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal desire (not just distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts).

**Conclusion**: The post expresses active suicidal desire but lacks a specific plan, preparation, or imminent timeline. It fits the IDEATION category per the decision tree and definitions.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""desire to kill myself"", ""Killing myself"", ""choose that"" (train as suicide metaphor).

   - Methods/preparations: **None described**.  
   - Past actions: **No suicide attempts mentioned**.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts. Distress is rooted in health anxiety, gender dysphoria, and fear of parental judgment.  
   - No passive suicidal ideation (e.g., intrusive thoughts about death).  
   - No rejection needed since suicidal intent is absent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Focus is **present/future anxiety** (fear of diabetes, impatience for adulthood, dread of parental reaction).  
   - **No timelines** related to self-harm.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → No past attempt (skips ATTEMPT).  
   - → No explicit suicide intent (skips BEHAVIOR/IDEATION).  
   - → Only distress/metaphors (""can't live without estrogen"" = survival dependency metaphor). → **INDICATOR**.

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""I can't live without estrogen"" is a **metaphor for despair** (similar to ""want to disappear""), not actionable suicide desire.  
- Distress about health/parental conflict fits INDICATOR’s scope of ""general unhappiness or despair.""

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active ownership: ""Now it's time to end it"" shows direct intent without rejection.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past: ""tried"" indicates historical attempts.  
   - Present: ""Now it's time"" confirms current intent.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

   - Preparation evidence: ""I have a plan, note and date"" (explicit preparations)  
   - Timeline specificity: ""in early April"" (defined future timeframe)

If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I'm going to kill myself"" (stated twice), ""actually do go through with it and kill myself"".
- **Indirect death references**: ""end up dead in a gutter one day"", ""get cremated"", ""this will probably be my last post ever"".
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me"", ""best for society if I just stay on the inside""), worthlessness (""nameless homeless people""), and unbearable pain (""suicidal thoughts have just been too much"", ""anger is worse than ever"", ""constantly on edge"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no details on pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. Mentions considering going to the ER for help, but this is help-seeking, not suicide preparation. Explicitly states ""haven't even left home yet"", indicating no action taken.
- **Past actions**: Describes self-harm (""how many cuts I have all over myself"") but not linked to a suicide attempt (no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Cuts are presented as existing injuries, not an actual suicide attempt.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct statements like ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""actually do go through with it"". No distancing language.
- **Passive experience**: Mentions ""suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently"", which could imply intrusiveness, but overall intent is actively owned.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""I won't do it""). Writer is ""still debating"" between help-seeking and suicide, but this does not constitute rejection; suicide remains a viable option.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No description of past suicide attempts. Self-harm (cuts) is historical/ongoing but not specified as suicidal.
- **Present intent**: Writer expresses current indecision (""I'm still debating"") but pairs it with imminent indicators: ""this will probably be my last post ever"" and ""Goodbye"", suggesting potential immediate action.
- **Future ideation**: General future references like ""end up dead in a gutter one day"" are non-specific, but the ""last post"" and ""Goodbye"" imply a shorter, more immediate timeline for suicide.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. Cuts are not described as a suicide attempt (no suicidal intent specified), so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""I'm going to kill myself"").
  - Specific method/preparation: No method specified; no preparation described (e.g., ""haven't left home yet"").
  - Immediate timeline: ""Last post ever"" and ""Goodbye"" are expressions of immediate intent (similar to ""tonight"" in implication), qualifying under ""imminent timeline"" per framework rules.
  - → Therefore, BEHAVIOR is indicated due to explicit intent + immediacy.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as immediacy is present.
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable; explicit suicide intent is present.

**Final Classification Rationale**: 
- Explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") combined with imminent indicators (""last post ever"", ""Goodbye"") meets BEHAVIOR criteria per the framework's critical expansion (""expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details"").
- No past attempt described, and writer-focused rules are followed (ignores hypotheticals about prison/homelessness).
- Immediacy trumps non-specific ideation, and no rejection downgrade applies (debating is not disavowal).
- Hierarchy: No attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.

26,"Im so tired i can't kill myself. I know a good clif but its around 4-5km, its possible to get there, i just can't commit to it. Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point. I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" and ""I'm suicidal"" are direct statements of suicidal ideation.
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"").
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself, there's no me at this point"") and worthlessness.
   - Specific methods: ""clif"" (likely a typo for ""cliff"") is identified as a method, with details on accessibility (""4-5km, its possible to get there"").
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting; only knowledge of the cliff's existence and distance.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I'm suicidal"").
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal is present (""i can't kill myself"" and ""i just can't commit to it""), indicating resistance to acting on thoughts. The phrase ""maybe its my brain playing with me"" suggests intrusive thoughts but is tied to doubting others' care, not directly rejecting suicide.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No references to past actions.
   - Present intent: No indication of current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""); instead, inability to act is emphasized.
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing implied by the cliff knowledge, but actively rejected with ""can't commit.""

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide desire (""suicidal"") is present, but paired with rejection (""can't kill myself"") and no evidence of preparation (only method knowledge, not acquisition) or immediate timeline → does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire exists, but rejection (""can't commit"") downgrades it per Rule 4 (rejection downgrade to INDICATOR). No plan or immediacy supports this downgrade.
   - d) Distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphors (""no me""), and rejected thoughts (""can't kill myself"") align with INDICATOR. The method mention does not escalate due to rejection and lack of actionability.

Final decision: INDICATOR, as per Rule 4 (rejection downgrade) and the absence of actionable intent, preparation, or immediacy.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end my life"", or ""not want to live"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: None. No language like ""not wake up"", ""be gone"", or ""painless way to die"". The statement ""i wish i was never born"" is metaphorical and reflects existential despair, not a direct reference to death.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong presence of hopelessness, worthlessness, and emotional pain (e.g., ""tired of everything"", ""tired of feeling this way"", ""tired of hating myself"", ""feeling disgusting"", ""nothing going for me""). Also includes helplessness (""tired of being told to just 'be happy'""), isolation (""tired of not having friends""), and low self-worth (""tired of being ugly"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, jumping, firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"", ""attempted"", or descriptions of self-harm).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: No explicit ownership of suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born"" express a desire for relief from suffering but do not constitute active suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"").
- **Passive experience**: No description of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me to..."").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The distress is presented as ongoing without rejection.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Descriptions of recurring feelings (e.g., ""crying myself to sleep every night"", ""remembering all of the mean shit people have said"") but no past suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"", ""now"", or specific timelines).
- **Future ideation**: No expressions of future suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""someday I will..."").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** → No, so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** → No explicit suicide intent (e.g., no ""want to die""); no specific methods, preparations, or imminent timelines. Thus, not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live"" are absent). ""I wish I was never born"" is metaphorical and regret-based, not an active desire for suicide. ""I just want it all to stop"" indicates distress, not suicidal ideation. Thus, not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post contains general unhappiness, hopelessness, despair, and metaphorical expressions (""i wish i was never born""), with no actionable suicide intent. This aligns with INDICATOR.

### Final Classification Rationale
- The post expresses intense distress, emotional pain, and metaphorical wishes but lacks explicit suicidal desire, plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts. Per the framework, INDICATOR includes ""general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" and ""metaphorical death references"" without active suicidal intent. The irreducible rules confirm this: no writer-focused suicide actions, no temporal hierarchy triggers, and no rejection to downgrade (since suicidal thoughts aren't present).

28,"Depressed. This month has already been a shit show, texted my mom I think I need to be on anti depressants and she just said 'schedule a doctors appointment' not 'are you okay? Do you want to talk?' I can't wait to fucking kill myself and have all my fake ass friends and shitty family go to the funeral. It's gonna be one last big fuck you",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" (direct statement of intent).  
   - Emotional markers: ""Depressed,"" ""shit show,"" anger toward family/friends (""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family""), revenge motivation (""big fuck you"").  
   - Indirect references: Funeral fantasy implies death but is contextually tied to suicide.  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership (""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"") with no disavowal. The funeral fantasy reinforces intent.  
   - No passive framing or rejection (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present/future intent: ""I can't wait"" implies urgency but lacks specificity (e.g., ""tonight""). Timeline is ambiguous, falling between imminent and non-specific.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt → Rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""kill myself"") + urgency (""can't wait"") but:  
     - No specific method/preparation mentioned.  
     - Timeline lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" absent).  
     → Fails **Behavior** criteria (requires method/preparation *or* immediate timeline).  
   - Explicit desire without actionable plan → Matches **Ideation**.  
   - Distress/metaphors alone? No—active suicidal desire overrules **Indicator**.  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Can't wait"" suggests strong desire but not immediate capability (Behavior requires ""tonight"" or concrete plans).  
- Funeral fantasy expresses motivation, not preparation.  
- Falls under **Ideation** per boundary: ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'.""

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""end it all"" is a direct reference to suicide, conveying a clear intent to die by one's own hand.
- **Indirect death references**: None present; ""goodbye everybody"" is contextually linked to the explicit suicide intent but not an indirect reference on its own.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness and isolation are evident in ""no one really understands"" and ""I doubt anyone will care,"" indicating despair.
- **Specific methods**: Not stated; the post mentions ""I already know how I'm gonna do it"" but does not specify the method (e.g., pills, hanging), so this remains vague.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations; the secrecy element (""I'm not gonna tell anyone"") suggests intent but is not a concrete preparation.
- **Past actions**: ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past attempts to seek help (""tell anyone""), not a suicide attempt. There is no description of self-harm with suicidal intent.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims direct ownership of suicidal thoughts with phrases like ""I'm ready"" and ""I'm finally ready to just end it all,"" showing personal commitment to the idea.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive or unwanted thoughts; the language is assertive and self-driven.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); instead, the resolve is reinforced with ""I'm not gonna tell anyone"" and ""goodbye.""

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: ""all ready tried that before"" describes a historical action (seeking help), not a suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: Current readiness is stated (""I'm ready""), but no immediate action is planned.
- **Future ideation**: The timeline is non-immediate and specific: ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks."" This indicates a future-oriented plan without urgency.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. ""all ready tried that before"" refers to seeking help, not self-harm. Rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt, but here it is not applied to suicide.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** Explicit intent (""end it all"") is present, but:
  - No specific method stated (only ""know how"" is vague).
  - No preparation evidence (e.g., acquiring means).
  - Timeline is not immediate (""wait a few weeks"" ≠ ""tonight"" or ""now""). Rule: Immediacy trumps, but here there is none.
  - → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes: ""end it all"" is an explicit wish to die, paired with a known method (implied but not actionable) and a delayed timeline. No evidence elevates it to BEHAVIOR. → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, due to explicit suicidal desire.

### Category Alignment
- **Indicator**: Ruled out because of explicit suicidal desire (""end it all"").
- **Ideation**: Fits perfectly—explicit suicidal desire without actionable plan (method unspecified) or immediacy (timeline is weeks away).
- **Behavior**: Not met, as there is no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt**: Not met, as no past self-harm with suicidal intent is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/intent are considered; no others mentioned.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrules ideation.
- Immediacy trumps: ""wait a few weeks"" lacks immediacy, so ideation stands.
- Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
- Output one category: IDEATION is the clearest fit.

- **Passive experience**: None.  
- **Rejection noted?**: Hesitation (""can't fucking do it"") but **no disavowal** of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t actually want to""). Frustration implies *unfulfilled intent*, not rejection.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Present intent**: Current struggle with acting (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""), immediate desire (""It'd be better off... if I did it"").

I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town.

My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. The phrase ""I just want to not exist"" expresses a desire for non-existence but is not an explicit suicide reference like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life."" The mention ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself"" is explicitly labeled as metaphorical and not literal.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I just want to not exist"" could be interpreted as an indirect reference to death, but it is framed as a wish for escape rather than a direct death wish. Similarly, ""wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land"" suggests a fantasy of escape, not death.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of hopelessness (e.g., ""I feel hollow,"" ""Never have I felt a lasting happiness,"" ""suffer in silence""), worthlessness (e.g., ""I'm a morally abhorrent piece of crap,"" ""I fucking hate myself""), and unbearable pain (e.g., ""It hurts so bad,"" ""God I fucking hate myself"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts or self-harm with suicidal intent. The phrase ""I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself"" refers to overworking, not an actual suicide attempt.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Desires like ""I just want to not exist"" suggest passive suicidal ideation, but it lacks active ownership (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I plan to die""). The metaphorical framing of ""kill myself"" indicates the writer does not endorse actual suicide.
- **Passive experience**: No description of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me to"" without context).
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present via the word ""metaphorically"" in ""kill myself,"" which downgrades this to non-actionable distress. The wish for non-existence is not rejected outright but is contextualized as part of a broader fantasy (""illusion land""), not a call to action.

- **Past focus**: References to historical unhappiness (e.g., not enjoying birthdays for 4-5 years) but no past suicide attempts.
- **Present intent**: No current plans, timelines, or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: General expressions like ""I just want to not exist"" are non-specific with no timing, falling under vague future ideation but not actionable.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent (desires are metaphorical or indirect), no specific method, no preparation, no immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** ""I just want to not exist"" approaches suicidal desire but is not explicit (e.g., lacks phrases like ""want to die""). It is also mitigated by context (fantasy-based escape) and the explicit rejection in ""metaphorically kill myself."" Without clear, actionable desire, this does not meet the threshold for IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post centers on emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness, self-hatred), metaphorical death references (""metaphorically kill myself,"" ""not exist"" as escape fantasy), and rejected thoughts due to disavowal (""metaphorically""). No expressions of active suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors → INDICATOR.

### Irreducible Rules Application
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis ignores mentions of others; focuses solely on the writer's expressions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No evidence of attempt or behavior, so hierarchy not triggered.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: The word ""metaphorically"" explicitly disavows literal intent, downgrading potential suicidal language to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: INDICATOR is the appropriate classification.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicide watch"", ""take a bunch of pills"", ""end it"", ""better if I was dead"".  
   - Indirect references: None dominant.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""wasn't made for life""), worthlessness (""contribute nothing""), self-loathing, despair (""too painful"").  
   - Specific methods: ""take a bunch of pills"".  
   - Preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: None mentioned.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Explicit desire (""wish I could just fucking end it"").  
   - Passive experience/rejection: Strong disavowal (""too scared"", ""don't want to die in pain"", ""don't want to make my mother sad"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future ideation: Hypothetical scenario (""could take pills while everyone's asleep"") with no immediacy (""tonight"", ""now"" absent).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   → No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   → Explicit intent + specific method (pills) BUT:  
     - No preparation/timeline (hypothetical ""could"").  
     - Explicit rejection (fear, concern for mother).  
   → Intent downgraded due to disavowal → **INDICATOR** per Rule 4.  
   → Without rejection, would be IDEATION (desire + method but no plan/immediacy).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Method specificity is overruled by:  
  (a) Lack of preparation/immediacy (""could"" ≠ ""will""),  
  (b) Explicit disavowal (""too scared"", ""don’t want to die in pain/make mother sad"").  
- Falls under INDICATOR per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade) and INDICATOR clarification (distress + metaphors/rejected thoughts).

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION (Writer-focused analysis):**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: Writer states: ""I have been suicidal on-and-off,"" ""I did have one very serious attempt in 2009,"" ""emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide.""  
- **Past actions**: Clear description of a past suicide attempt (""very serious attempt in 2009"").  
- **Emotional markers**: References personal history of depression, anxiety, and Crohn’s disease, but current state is ""good place"" with no recent ideation.  
- **Friend’s content ignored**: All details about the friend’s struggles are irrelevant per Rule 1 (writer-focused).  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (Writer’s statements only):**  
- Active endorsement of *past* intent: ""I did have one very serious attempt"" shows ownership.  
- **Rejection noted**: Writer explicitly states current stability (""in a good place now,"" ""haven’t had suicidal ideation in months"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- **Past focus**: Attempt occurred in 2009; ideation is historical (""on-and-off for much of my life"").  
- **No present/future intent**: Current status is non-suicidal (""good place now"").  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- Start → **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → YES (""serious attempt in 2009"").  
- → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
- Temporal hierarchy (Rule 2): ""Attempt"" overrides all other categories.  

**Key Clarifications Applied:**  
- Writer’s current stability doesn’t negate the past attempt classification (per Attempt definition).  
- Friend’s crisis is excluded (Rule 1: writer-focused).

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", and implied in ""only reason I didn't die last night"".
- **Indirect death references**: ""save some flowers for me"" (metaphorical, but in suicidal context), ""enough is enough"" (suggests finality).
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't trust anyone"", ""no comfort left""), worthlessness (""they just treat me like shit""), and unbearable pain (trauma/PTSD, mistreatment by professionals).
- **Specific methods**: None explicitly stated (e.g., no mention of pills, firearms, etc.).
- **Preparations**: Setting a specific date (""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date either that day or before it"") and context of seeking psychiatrist as potential final action, but no direct evidence of acquiring means or writing notes.
- **Past actions**: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""only reason I didn't die last night"" (indicating past suicide attempts, including recent near-attempt).

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""my suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"").
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; intent is presented as deliberate.
- **Rejection noted?**: Ambivalence expressed (""I actually wanna live if I could get the help""), but this is conditional on unavailable help and does not disavail intent—suicide plan remains active due to perceived lack of support. Thus, not a full rejection (per rule: ""Rejection downgrade"" only applies to explicit disavowal like ""I don't actually want to"").

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""didn't die last night"" describe historical and recent actions.
- **Present intent**: ""end thing v v soon"" and suicide date set for immediate future (""this Friday or before"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing absent; focus is on concrete, imminent timeline.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at a): Past suicide attempt described (""constant attempts"" and ""didn't die last night"" imply actual attempts, including recent events). → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt; overrules concurrent ideation/behavior).
- b) Not reached due to a), but explicit intent + imminent timeline (""this Friday or before"") would qualify as BEHAVIOR if no attempt mentioned.
- c) and d) Not applicable due to attempt description and active intent.
- **Irreducible rules applied**: Temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior) takes precedence; writer-focused (all references are to self); no full rejection downgrade.

   - Past actions: No descriptions of attempts (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Passive experience: Suicidal themes are framed as existential dread (""I want to disappear forever"") and fatalism (""I know I will die by 35""), not active intent.  
   - Rejection noted: Implicitly rejects action due to theological constraints (""God won’t let that happen"") and acknowledges consequences (""pain caused to people""). No explicit disavowal of suicide, but no ownership of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timeline (""die by 35,"" with current age 22). No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt → Not ""attempt.""  
   - b) No explicit intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → Not ""behavior.""  
   - c) No explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""want to die""); ""disappear"" is metaphorical → Not ""ideation.""  
   - d) Distress (""pointlessness""), metaphors (""missing pixel""), fatalism (""die by 35"" without suicide context), and rejected agency (""God won’t let that happen"") → **INDICATOR**.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill yourself"", ""hanging myself"", ""trying to die""  
   - Specific methods: Hanging (""hanging myself""), pills (""taking these pills"")  
   - Preparation evidence: Evaluating method effectiveness (weight vs. hanging, pill dosage)  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""Shits difficult""), worthlessness implied (""being fat"")  
   - No explicit past attempts (""tried to"" absent)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active ownership of intent: ""I'm trying to die""  
   - No disavowal/rejection: Humor (""😂"", ""😎"") contextualizes frustration but doesn’t negate intent  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present-focused problem-solving: Actively assessing methods *now* (""idk if hanging... would work"")  
   - No historical (""last week"") or future (""someday"") framing

   → a) No past attempt described → *Not ATTEMPT*  
   → b) **Explicit intent (""trying to die"") + specific methods (hanging/pills) + capability assessment (weight/pill dosage) → BEHAVIOR**  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Method specificity (hanging mechanics, pill quantity) + active problem-solving meets **BEHAVIOR** threshold per rules:  
  > *""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details""* (here, methods *are* detailed)  
- Humor doesn’t downgrade (no rejection like ""but I won’t""), only reflects coping.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I want to die""  
   - Emotional markers: ""depressed and numb,"" ""sick of everything,"" ""everything is so much effort,"" ""can't think straight""  
   - **Absent elements**: No specific methods, preparations, past attempts, or immediate timeline. Explicit rejection noted: ""I'm probably not gonna do anything because I'm scared of messing it up.""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of desire (""I want to die"") but **explicit rejection of action** (""not gonna do anything"").  
   - Rejection is self-aware and motive-based (fear of failure).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present-focused distress (""I want to die *now*"") but **no immediacy** (""tonight,"" ""now"" absent).  
   - Future safety consideration (""maybe I need [psych ward] right now"") contradicts imminent risk.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt → ❌ **ATTEMPT**  
   - Explicit desire + **but no method/preparation/immediacy** → ❌ **BEHAVIOR**  
   - Explicit desire (""want to die"") → initially suggests *Ideation*, **HOWEVER**:  
     - Rejection clause (""not gonna do anything"") triggers **Rule 4** (downgrade to Indicator).  
   - **FINAL PATH**: Rejected intent + distress → **INDICATOR** (per boundary: ""Rejected thoughts → indicator"").  

</thinking>
Final Classification: **indicator**  

**Key Rationale**:  
- ""Want to die"" is explicitly neutered by self-correction (""not gonna do anything""), aligning with Rule 4.  
- Psych ward inquiry reflects help-seeking, not planning.  
- Numbness/exhaustion are distress signals without actionable suicidality.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""take them all"" (referring to pills) implies intentional overdose for suicide.
   - Indirect death references: ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" suggests death as a desired outcome.
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""living a life nobody loves or cares for me in"") and worthlessness (""why am i such a coward"").
   - Specific methods: Pills are explicitly mentioned as the method.
   - Preparations: ""every night i count my pills"" indicates recurrent handling and access to means, which is preparatory behavior.
   - Past actions: No description of a past suicide attempt; ""why i didnt take them all"" refers to inaction, not an actual attempt.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer expresses ownership of suicidal thoughts through regret for not acting (""why i didnt take them all"" and ""why am i such a coward""), showing active desire.
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the thoughts are presented as personal and endorsed.
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); instead, self-criticism reinforces intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Refers to recurring past inaction (""every day i wonder why i didnt take them all"").
   - Present intent: Describes ongoing preparatory behavior (""every night i count my pills"").
   - Future ideation: No specific imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight""); ""every night"" is habitual but not acutely immediate.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) Past attempt described? No; the post describes inaction, not an actual attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? 
     - Explicit suicide intent: Yes, from ""take them all"" and regret for not acting.
     - Specific method: Pills are stated.
     - Preparation evidence: ""every night i count my pills"" qualifies as recurrent preparatory behavior (handling means).
     - Immediate timeline: No (""every night"" is habitual, not imminent like ""tonight"").
     → Criteria met due to explicit intent + specific method + preparation evidence. → BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Not applicable, as specific method and preparation are present.
   - d) Only distress/rejected thoughts? No, due to active suicidal desire and preparatory actions.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:
1. Writer-focused: All content is about the writer; no mentions of others.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so behavior takes precedence over ideation.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), so not a factor.
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection of thoughts; intent is reinforced.
5. Output exactly one category: BEHAVIOR is selected.

Final classification is BEHAVIOR due to explicit suicidal intent, specified method (pills), and evidence of preparation (counting pills nightly), despite the lack of an immediate timeline.

   - Indirect death references: None (""not wake up"", ""be gone"" absent).  
   - Emotional markers: Strong presence (""unbearably strong"" thoughts, ""downward spiral"", ""struggle"").  
   - Methods/preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: References psych ward history but **no description of suicide attempt** (e.g., no ""tried to"", ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - Focuses on distress and secrecy (""keeping this a secret"") to avoid hospitalization.  
   - No rejection phrasing (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"") since suicidal intent isn’t asserted.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past: Mentions prior psych ward stay (unspecified reason).  
   - Present: Describes ongoing distress (""lately"", ""everyday struggle"").  
   - No future intent or timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"", ""soon"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) No explicit intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: None. Phrases like ""don't wanna do this anymore"" and ""lost all will to live"" convey distress but lack direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""
   - Indirect death references: None. No mentions of death, dying, or methods.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""I don't think I'll ever find my soulmate""), worthlessness (""rejected because of my looks""), and despair (""empty, alone, uncared for"").
   - Methods/preparations: Absent. No references to tools, plans, or locations.
   - Past actions: None. No description of prior attempts or self-harm.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Passive experience: Distress is presented as endured suffering (""I feel empty""), not active suicidal ownership. ""Lost all will to live"" suggests existential despair, not a direct death wish.
   - Rejection noted: The writer explicitly minimizes their feelings (""sounds so stupid""), framing them as irrational rather than actionable.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Present/future focus: Hopelessness is generalized (""I don't think I'll ever""), with no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - → No past attempt (rules out ATTEMPT).  
   - → No explicit suicide intent (rules out BEHAVIOR/IDEATION). ""Lost all will to live"" is metaphorical despair, not active desire to die.  
   - → Only distress/hopelessness with rejected thoughts → INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused: All content references the user's own emotions.  
- Rejection downgrade: Self-minimization (""sounds so stupid"") confirms non-actionable distress.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I don't want to live anymore"", ""when i off myself"" (colloquial for suicide).  
   - Emotional markers: ""can't keep living with depression"", despair about future (""can't continue to live for decades"").  
   - Preparations: None mentioned (e.g., acquiring means, notes).  
   - Past actions: No description of prior attempts.  
   - Indirect references: ""my death"" (contextualized suicidally via ""off myself"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Ownership clear (""*I* don't want to live"", ""*I* off myself"").  
   - Rejection noted? Ambivalence about impact on mother, but **no disavowal** of intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future ideation: ""can't continue to live for decades to come"" implies non-immediate timing (vs. ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit desire (""don't want to live"") + method implied (""off myself"") but **no specificity** (e.g., pills, location) and **no preparation/immediacy** → Does not meet BEHAVIOR threshold.  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""don't want to live"") without plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.  
   - Distress present but active suicidal desire overrides → Not INDICATOR.  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Off myself"" confirms suicidal intent but lacks method/timeline specificity.  
- Temporal phrasing (""decades to come"") negates immediacy.  
- Concern for mother shows ambivalence but **not rejection** of suicidal intent (Rule 4 not triggered).

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""just killing myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""what's the fucking point in any of this"", ""what's the point in not"") and worthlessness (implied by inability to work or afford treatment), with themes of unbearable pain from mental health struggles.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no details on pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""i know that i'm going to end up... just killing myself,"" presenting it as a personal conclusion rather than an intrusive thought.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of thoughts being framed as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The statement is resigned and accepting, framing suicide as an inevitable outcome.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide-related actions; only current distress is described.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). Suicide is framed as a future possibility (""going to end up"") conditional on becoming ""fed up,"" with no specificity.
- **Future ideation**: Clear non-specific future timing (""end up"" implies eventual action without plan or immediacy).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No → Not ""attempt"".
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: Explicit intent is present (""killing myself""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet ""behavior"" criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes—explicit desire (""killing myself"") is stated, but it lacks actionable details (method, preparation) and immediacy → Points to ""ideation"".
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No—explicit suicide desire is present, so not solely ""indicator"".

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Ideation** fits: Active suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) with no plan or immediacy. The phrase ""killing myself"" expresses a wish to die, but it's future-oriented and non-actionable.
- **Behavior** is not met: Absence of method, preparation, or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
- **Attempt** is not applicable: No past actions described.
- **Indicator** is ruled out: While distress and hopelessness are present, explicit suicidal desire overrules this category.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Only the user's own situation and intent are discussed.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrides, as no past actions or immediacy.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediate timeline, so ideation stands.
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection of thoughts; instead, they are endorsed.
5. Output one category: Ideation is the clear fit.

55,"""You look like you're about to die"". Yeah no shit mom, Iam depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
   - Explicit suicide references: ""tried to kms"" (abbreviated for ""kill myself"") is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
   - Indirect death references: The quote ""You look like you're about to die"" is from the mother and not the writer's own expression. Per irreducible rule 1 (writer-focused), this is ignored.
   - Emotional markers: ""depressed af"" indicates significant distress and hopelessness.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned; ""kms"" is general and lacks method details.
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: ""tried to kms yesterday"" clearly describes a past suicide attempt with suicidal intent.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of the suicidal action with ""I... tried to kms,"" showing direct personal involvement.
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the statement is declarative and self-attributed.
   - Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it again""); the writer is recounting the attempt without rejection.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
   - Past focus: The attempt is explicitly time-bound to ""yesterday,"" with no reference to current or future intent.
   - Present intent: Absent; no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"" indicating immediacy.
   - Future ideation: None described.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
   - Start → a) Past suicide attempt described (""tried to kms yesterday"") → ATTEMPT. This satisfies the category definition: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt, and it overrules other categories per temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation). No concurrent behavior or ideation with immediacy is present to override this.

To the point that I question if I did something horrific in a previous life and it was so bad that I'm still paying for it in this life. I cant. Please. I cant live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are absent. The closest is ""I cant live anymore,"" which expresses a desire to not live but is not an explicit suicide reference.
- **Indirect death references**: ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" suggests a vague reference to death or dying (e.g., ""do this"" implies ending life), but it lacks specificity. ""I cant live anymore"" is an indirect expression of not wanting to continue living.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I absolutely cannot fight anymore""), worthlessness (""question if I did something horrific""), and unbearable pain (""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years"") are prominent.
- **Specific methods**: ""Non painful way"" hints at a method but is non-specific and not actionable (e.g., no mention of pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of actions).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of thoughts with ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I cant,"" ""I question,"" ""I cant live anymore""), indicating personal experience rather than passive or intrusive thoughts. The phrase ""I cant live anymore"" shows active desire to end life, but it is not explicitly suicidal (e.g., no ""I want to die"").
- **Passive experience**: No indications of thoughts being presented as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The plea ""Please"" suggests distress but not a rejection of intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide-related events.
- **Present intent**: Expressions like ""I cant live anymore"" and ""non painful way to do this"" indicate current suffering and ideation, but no specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" implies non-specific future thinking about death, without immediacy.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** 
  - Explicit suicide intent: ""I cant live anymore"" conveys a desire to not live, but it is not explicit like ""want to die"" (based on framework wording). ""Non painful way"" is indirect and non-specific.
  - No specific method/preparation or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
  → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** 
  - ""I cant live anymore"" is interpreted as an explicit wish to die (similar to ""don't deserve to live"" in sentiment, per Ideation definition). ""Non painful way"" indicates non-actionable method ideation.
  - No plan, preparation, or immediacy.
  → Meets IDEATION criteria.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** 
  - Distress and hopelessness are present, but ""I cant live anymore"" goes beyond metaphor (e.g., ""want to disappear"") to express active suicidal desire. No rejection of thoughts.
  → Does not qualify as INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Only the writer's experiences are mentioned.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, behavior, or immediacy, so Ideation stands.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediate timeline to override.
4. Rejection downgrade: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""), so no downgrade to Indicator.
5. Output exactly one category.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses an explicit wish to die (""I cant live anymore"") with non-actionable method ideation (""non painful way"") but no plan, preparation, or immediacy. This aligns with the IDEATION category (active suicidal desire without actionable plan).

   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself""  
   - Specific method: ""with drugs""  
   - Preparation: ""write a suicide note""  
   - Temporal marker: ""next week"" (future but specific)  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness implied (""family upset... they understand me"")  
   - No past attempts or rejection of intent.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I want to do it,"" ""I want to kill myself"" (clear ownership).  
   - No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future timeline (""next week""), but concrete and actionable.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit intent (""kill myself"") + specific method (""drugs"") + preparation (""write suicide note"") + defined timeline (""next week"") → **BEHAVIOR** (fulfills criteria under Rule 2 and 3).  
   - ""Next week"" is sufficiently imminent for behavior classification per *Key boundary* (""this weekend"" equivalent).  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused: All statements are self-referential.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Behavior supersedes ideation (specific plan + preparation).  
- No rejection to downgrade.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - No explicit suicide references (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - No indirect death references (e.g., ""not wake up,"" ""be gone"").  
   - Strong emotional markers: Hopelessness (""i'm always tired,"" ""no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely""), worthlessness (""i don't have enough money,"" ""pushing everyone away""), and unbearable pain (""none of the pills do enough"").  
   - No specific suicide methods mentioned (pills referenced are for treatment, not suicide).

   - No past actions (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted"").  
   - Ambiguous phrase: ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" – could imply desire to end suffering but lacks explicit suicide context.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - No passive descriptions of intrusive suicidal thoughts.  
   - No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts (since none are stated).  
   - The phrase ""get this over with"" is metaphorical and contextually refers to enduring life struggles, not suicide.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing distress (""always tired,"" ""cyclic"" life) and future worries (college, finances).  
   - ""Soon"" in ""get this over with"" is non-specific and tied to life circumstances, not a suicide timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt described → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - b) No explicit suicide intent, method, preparation, or immediacy → **Not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die"") → **Not IDEATION**.  
   - d) Solely distress (exhaustion, hopelessness, loneliness) and metaphorical expressions (""get this over with"" without suicide context) → **INDICATOR**.

- ""I'm ready to get this over with"" is a distress metaphor, similar to ""want to disappear."" Without explicit suicide context, it remains an indicator.  
- Emotional markers (hopelessness, worthlessness) align with general distress, not actionable suicidality.  
- Applies **Irreducible Rule 4**: Absence of active suicidal desire or ownership downgrades to indicator.

59,"I finally went through. I regret everything that led me to this point. I have overdosed. I regret it. I also don't. I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over. I took 500mg Zoloft, so it won't kill me, but it'll punish me for being such a nuisance to society. It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit. I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"### Thinking
I will apply the framework step-by-step to analyze the user post systematically.

#### 1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**
   - **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""I have overdosed,"" which directly references a suicide-related action. However, the writer also states, ""I don't want to die,"" which explicitly rejects death as a goal.
   - **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""want my suffering to be over"" and ""it won't kill me"" imply a desire for relief from pain, but not necessarily death.
   - **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""regret everything that led me to this point"") and worthlessness (""punish me for being such a nuisance to society"") are present.
   - **Specific methods**: Overdose is specified with details: ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" (a known method of self-harm).
   - **Preparations**: The act of taking pills (""I took 500mg Zoloft"") is evidence of preparation and execution.
   - **Past actions**: ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" clearly describe a completed past action of self-harm with suicidal undertones. The phrase ""it hasn't been that long"" indicates this action occurred recently.

#### 2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**
   - **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of the action (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took""), but explicitly rejects the intent to die (""I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over""). This shows ambivalence— the action was taken to ""punish"" or end suffering, not necessarily to die.
   - **Passive experience**: No intrusive or passive thoughts are described; the focus is on active behavior.
   - **Rejection noted**: The statement ""I don't want to die"" is a clear disavowal of suicidal intent, downgrading the perceived risk. However, this rejection applies to the desire for death, not the harmful action itself.

#### 3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
   - **Past focus**: The overdose is described as a completed past action (""I have overdosed,"" ""I took""), with recent effects noted (""it hasn't been that long"").
   - **Present intent**: No current or future plans for suicide are expressed; the writer discusses symptoms (""headache"") and regret, but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - **Future ideation**: Absent; the writer does not mention any ongoing or future suicidal thoughts.

#### 4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
   - Start at **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → Yes, ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" constitute a described past suicide attempt. This meets the Attempt category definition: ""description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent,"" including cases where the outcome was non-fatal (e.g., ""it won't kill me"") or aborted. The writer's ambivalence (""I regret it. I also don't"") does not negate the attempt, as per the rule that ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always triggers Attempt.
   - Since **a)** is satisfied, the decision tree stops here. The Attempt category overrules others due to temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation). The rejection (""I don't want to die"") does not downgrade a described attempt to a lower category, as per irreducible rules (rejection downgrade applies only to thoughts, not actions).

**Final Classification Rationale**: The post describes a concrete past action of self-harm (overdose) with suicidal context, fulfilling the Attempt category. Even though the writer disavows the desire to die and indicates the act was non-lethal, this is consistent with the category's clarification that it includes interrupted or aborted attempts. No higher-risk elements (e.g., imminent future plans) override this.

60,"I'm doing it in the near future. I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to. I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go. I'm ready.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains phrases like ""I'm doing it"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" which imply suicide action (e.g., ""doing it"" is a common euphemism for suicide, and ""ready to go"" suggests readiness for death).
- **Indirect death references**: ""I'm ready to go"" can be interpreted as an indirect reference to death, but it is less explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: The writer expresses a sense of peace (""I feel so at peace right now"") and resolution (""now I think I'm ready to go""), which may indicate emotional preparedness for suicide, but no overt hopelessness or worthlessness is present.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or details on how the act would be carried out.
- **Preparations**: References spending time with a favourite person (""I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend"") could imply preparatory behavior (e.g., saying goodbye), but it is not explicit preparation like acquiring means, writing a note, or scouting locations as defined in the framework.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no use of ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer clearly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct statements like ""I'm doing it"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" indicating personal intent.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the language is assertive and resolved.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the tone is affirmative (""knowing I'm going to"").

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or actions.
- **Present intent**: Current emotional state (""I feel so at peace"") and readiness (""I'm ready"") are present, but the suicidal action is framed for the future.
- **Future ideation**: The timeline is explicitly future-oriented with ""in the near future,"" which is non-specific (not immediate like ""tonight"" or ""now"").

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No, so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit suicidal intent is present (""I'm doing it""), but there is no specific method, explicit preparation (e.g., acquiring means), or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). ""Near future"" is not considered imminent per framework rules (immediacy requires ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" or similar). Thus, BEHAVIOR is not met.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes, there is explicit desire to act (""I'm doing it,"" ""I'm ready to go"") but no actionable plan or immediacy. This aligns with IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No, as explicit suicidal intent is present.

**Category Definitions and Rules Application**:
- The post shows active suicidal desire without an actionable plan or imminent timeline, fitting IDEATION per the definition: ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan"" (e.g., ""want to die"" or similar expressions without specifics).
- Rules reinforced:
  - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so lower categories considered.
  - Immediacy: ""Near future"" does not qualify as immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" would trigger BEHAVIOR).
  - Rejection downgrade: Absent; no disavowal of intent.
  - Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions are referenced.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""i was suicidal"" (past tense).  
   - Emotional markers: Frustration (""counselors suck""), but no current hopelessness/worthlessness.  
   - No methods, preparations, or past actions described beyond historical suicidal state.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - All suicidal content is framed in the past (""i **was** suicidal"", ""found out"", ""4 yrs ago"").  
   - No active ownership of current suicidal thoughts. Focus is on criticizing past institutional response.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Exclusively past-focused (""4 yrs ago""). No present/future intent or ideation.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   → No past **attempt** described (only historical suicidal feelings).  
   → No current intent/method/preparation → Not behavior.  
   → No active desire to die → Not ideation.  
   → Historical distress + metaphorical critique (""counselors suck"") → **Indicator**.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- Past suicidal state ≠ current attempt/ideation (Temporal Hierarchy Rule).  
- ""I was suicidal"" without attempt details → Indicator (Attempt category requires described action).  
- Focus on systemic failure, not active self-harm intent (Writer-Focused Rule).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"", ""Might as well just die"".  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), worthlessness (""shit person""), isolation (""lock myself away""), and despair (""unexplainable void"").  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Direct ownership (""Should I just go and kill myself?"").  
   - No rejection or disavowal of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present/future ideation: Questions about suicide (""Should I..."") and non-specific timing (""Might as well just die"").  
   - No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") or past actions.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - ❌ No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - ❌ Explicit desire (""kill myself"") but lacks method/preparation/immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - ✅ Explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"", ""die"") without actionable plan/immediacy → IDEATION.  
   - ❌ Not downgraded to INDICATOR: No rejection of thoughts; distress coexists with active desire.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused (no external references).  
- No temporal/immediacy triggers.  
- No rejection phrases to downgrade.

I am just rubbish sucking at everything. I hate my family I have no friends I am so sensitive. I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me. tho I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything. I still hate that why everyone was born in a rich family at least not that poor like me. I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""kill myself,"" which is an explicit and direct reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""i should die"" and ""if I keep living on the earth"" imply death but are not explicit; they are contextualized by the explicit reference.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I am just rubbish sucking at everything""), worthlessness (""I don't think it makes any sense that they have to raise me""), and guilt (""they have to support me for the rest of their lives"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned; ""prepared everything"" is vague and lacks detail (e.g., no mention of pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: ""I have prepared everything"" indicates evidence of preparation, though unspecified (e.g., could include acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no terms like ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of actions). The phrase ""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"" describes intent and preparation, not an actual attempt.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I had made up my mind to kill myself,"" indicating active intent.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The anger toward family (""I hate my family,"" ""fuck"") does not constitute rejection of suicide; it reinforces distress.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: The decision and preparation occurred ""a few days"" ago (""I had made up my mind to kill myself a few days tho I have prepared everything"").
- **Present intent**: Current expressions like ""i should die"" suggest ongoing suicidal desire but lack specificity or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: General statements like ""i should die"" imply non-specific future timing, but no concrete plans or timelines are stated.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post describes intent (""made up my mind"") and preparation (""prepared everything""), but no actual attempt (e.g., no ""tried,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of self-harm). → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)** → Yes, explicit intent (""kill myself"") is present. Preparation evidence (""prepared everything"") exists, satisfying the ""preparation"" criterion, even though it is vague. However, no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified. Since preparation alone qualifies for BEHAVIOR under the framework, this points to BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy** → Not applicable, as preparation evidence elevates this beyond IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts** → Not applicable, due to explicit suicidal intent and preparation.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: The post focuses solely on the writer's own experiences and intent.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt described, so BEHAVIOR > IDEATION if criteria met.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), so not a factor.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of suicidal thoughts, so no downgrade to INDICATOR.

**Conclusion**: The combination of explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") and preparation evidence (""prepared everything"") meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR, as per the decision tree. The lack of an immediate timeline does not override the preparation component, based on the framework's inclusion of preparation evidence for BEHAVIOR classification.

Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back. As for my roommates, they're not dumb, they'll be able to put 2 and 2 together. But will most likely be unphased by the realization. I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""vanish without a trace"" (contextually implies death), ""no one will find my body"".  
- **Indirect death references**: ""vanishing"", ""walk until I find a secluded spot"".  
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), worthlessness (""they never seemed to enjoy my company"").  
- **Specific methods**: ""pistol"" explicitly stated.  
- **Preparations**: Detailed plan to empty bank account, leave belongings, isolate with untraceable items (cash/shoes), and acquire a pistol for the final act.  
- **Past actions**: None described.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership (""I would want to vanish"", ""I plan to have on me a pistol"").  
- **Passive experience**: None; thoughts are presented as deliberate decisions.  
- **Rejection noted?**: No disavowal; final line reinforces resignation (""I hope they enjoy my stuff"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Future ideation**: Trigger-dependent (""when that happens""), but plan is fully operationalized.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- a) No past attempt → *Not ATTEMPT*.  
- b) **Explicit suicide intent** (""vanish without a trace"" + body concealment) + **specific method** (pistol) + **preparations** (financial/logistical steps) → **BEHAVIOR**.  
- c) Ideation would require lack of plan/immediacy, but detailed plan exists.  
- d) Not applicable due to active intent.  

**Key Rule Applications**:  
- Temporal Hierarchy: Future trigger but concrete plan → behavior (Rule 3).  
- Rejection downgrade: Absent (Rule 4).  
- Writer-focused: All actions are self-directed (Rule 1).

What the fuck have I even become, I don't recognise myself anymore, fuck the mental health system.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
**Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**
- Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die"" is a direct and explicit statement of suicidal desire.
- Indirect death references: Phrases like ""we all just fake it till we die"" and ""i give up now"" imply a general resignation to life but are not specific suicide references; they are metaphorical or contextual.
- Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""life is shit""), worthlessness (""what the fuck have I even become""), despair (""no one cares""), and frustration with societal issues and the mental health system.
- Specific methods: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- Past actions: No description of prior suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" is absent).

**Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS**
- Active endorsement: The statement ""I want to die"" shows direct ownership of suicidal thoughts; it is not presented as intrusive or external.
- Passive experience or rejection: No indication that these thoughts are unwanted or rejected (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). The tone is one of active distress without disavowal.

**Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
- Past focus: No references to past events or attempts.
- Present intent: ""i give up now"" and ""im this fucking close"" suggest current distress and potential immediacy, but they are vague and not explicitly tied to a suicide plan or timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or specific deadline). ""I give up now"" is more emotional surrender than a stated plan for imminent action.
- Future ideation: ""I want to die"" expresses a general, non-specific desire without timing details.

**Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
- a) Past suicide attempt described? → No, so not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? → Explicit intent (""I want to die"") is present, but there is no specific method/preparation, and the timeline lacks clear immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" is absent; ""now"" in ""i give up now"" is ambiguous and not decisively suicidal). Thus, does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → Yes, ""I want to die"" is explicit, and there is no actionable plan or imminent timeline, fitting IDEATION.
- d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → No, because explicit suicidal desire is present, so not INDICATOR.

**Rules Application:**
- Writer-focused: Only the user's own expressions are considered.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrides, so IDEATION stands.
- Immediacy trumps: No clear imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate to behavior.
- Rejection downgrade: No rejection of thoughts, so no downgrade to indicator.
- Output one category: IDEATION is the best fit.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

I will analyze the user's post step-by-step using the provided framework to classify the suicide risk category. The framework involves Content Deconstruction, Intent Analysis, Temporal Framework, and the Category Decision Tree. I will adhere strictly to the irreducible rules: writer-focused, temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation), immediacy trumps, rejection downgrade, and outputting exactly one category.

#### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements like ""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"" and ""when i do do it"" (referring to suicide).
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""I wont be found for a while"" and ""rotting away"" imply death-related themes, but not explicit suicide.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""the feelings are always there,"" ""no one cares right now,"" ""I feel i bring the mood down,"" ""disconected,"" ""dark,"" ""rotting away"") and worthlessness (""No one regulary checks on me"").
- **Specific methods**: Mentions ""got a rope"" (implying hanging) and specifies a location: ""woodland where i would do it.""
- **Preparations**: Evidence of planning, including scouting a location (""woodland where i would do it"") and organizing logistics (""leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police""). However, he states he has not acquired means: ""ive not gone and got a rope.""
- **Past actions**: Describes historical self-harm (""was a very violent child... scratch and punch my self"") but clarifies this was not a suicide attempt. No mention of past suicide attempts; he only references ""intrusive thoughts"" discussed with a psychologist years ago, not actual attempts.

#### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts, e.g., ""Ive been suicidal,"" ""when i do do it,"" and ""ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it."" This shows direct personal intent.
- **Passive experience**: Mentions past ""intrusive thoughts"" but currently presents thoughts as active and self-owned, not involuntary.
- **Rejection noted**: He acknowledges the feelings may be temporary (""I know this feeling now is temporary... I know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks"") and desires a ""long term fix,"" but this is not an explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no statement like ""I won't do it""). Instead, he continues planning, so no downgrade to indicator.

#### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: References long-term suicidal feelings (10 years), historical self-harm, and past help-seeking (e.g., hotlines, psychologists), but no past suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: Expresses current high risk with ""Im on the edge"" and ""just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge,"" indicating imminent vulnerability. Also, recent decisions include scouting the woodland and planning notes.
- **Future ideation**: Recognizes the cyclical nature of feelings (""this will come back around again"") but couples this with concrete present planning, reducing the focus on non-specific timing.

#### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No described attempt. Historical self-harm is noted, but it is not framed as a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language for suicide). Thus, not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** Yes.  
  - Explicit suicidal intent: Clear with ""Ive been suicidal"" and ""when i do do it.""  
  - Specific method: ""got a rope"" (method) and ""woodland where i would do it"" (location).  
  - Preparation evidence: Scouting location (""woodland"") and planning notes (""leave notes on the paths"").  
  - Immediacy: ""on the edge"" and ""a tradgedy... away from goin over that edge"" suggests high imminent risk (similar to ""this weekend"" in framework examples).  
  - Rule application: Preparation (location and notes) and immediacy meet criteria for BEHAVIOR, even without acquired means (e.g., rope not obtained). Framework specifies ""preparation evidence"" includes scouting locations or writing notes, and ""immediacy trumps"" non-specific ideation.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as there is a plan and immediacy.
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to explicit intent and planning.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/thoughts are considered (e.g., ignores mentions of others).
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so behavior is prioritized over ideation.
- Immediacy trumps: ""on the edge"" indicates imminent risk, elevating to BEHAVIOR.
- Rejection downgrade: No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""); temporary feelings acknowledgment doesn't negate intent.
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable.

I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements: ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" ""Off myself"" is a colloquial but unambiguous reference to suicide, and ""don't wanna live"" explicitly expresses a desire to cease living.
- **Indirect death references**: None present. Phrases like ""be gone"" or ""painless way to die"" are absent.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress, anger, and hopelessness are evident (e.g., ""I hate my life,"" ""sick and tired,"" ""everything taken away from me,"" ""complete bullshit""). These indicate emotional turmoil but are contextualized by the specific frustration over driving restrictions.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or descriptions of how self-harm would occur.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The focus is on life circumstances, not suicide planning.
- **Past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts, self-harm, or phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted."" The narrative centers on past events related to obtaining a driver's license, not suicidal behavior.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct, first-person statements: ""I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore."" This shows active desire, not passive experience.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" or similar framing). The thoughts are presented as voluntary expressions of current emotion.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The statements are unqualified expressions of intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: The post primarily recounts past events (e.g., license delays, family conflicts), but suicidal statements are in the present tense, reflecting current feelings.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal expressions (""I wanna off myself,"" ""I don't even wanna live anymore"") indicate present desire, but there is no specific or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No future-oriented suicidal language (e.g., ""someday"" or ""eventually""). The ideation is anchored in the present context of distress.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. The post describes no past suicidal actions.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal intent is present (""wanna off myself""), but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). Thus, it does not meet the threshold for BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes. The core expressions (""wanna off myself,"" ""don't wanna live anymore"") demonstrate active suicidal desire, but they lack actionable details like a plan, method, or imminent timing. This aligns with IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No. While distress is present, the explicit suicidal desire rules out INDICATOR. Metaphorical language (e.g., ""disappear"") or rejected thoughts are absent.

### Final Classification Rationale
- The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""wanna off myself"") without evidence of a plan, preparation, or immediacy. This fits the IDEATION category per the definition: ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan.""
- Irreducible rules applied: 
  - Writer-focused: All suicidal references are about the user, not others.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt or current behavior overrules.
  - Immediacy: Absence of ""tonight"" or similar keeps this at IDEATION.
  - Rejection: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") to downgrade to INDICATOR.
- Output must be exactly one category: IDEATION is the highest applicable level based on content.

- Explicit suicide reference: ""tonight's the night I guess"" (implies suicide plan).  
- Emotional markers: ""desperate,"" ""hopeless,"" ""no one cares,"" ""no one will miss me.""  
- Preparations: None explicitly stated (e.g., no method/note).

   - **Explicit suicide references**: None directly stated (e.g., no ""kill myself"").  
   - **Indirect death references**: Implicit via method (""cutting an artery"").  
   - **Emotional markers**: Distress implied (""don’t know who else to ask"").

   - **Preparations**: Researching method efficacy (""wouldn’t taking oxy lessen the pain"").  
   - **Past actions**: None described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Ownership of method (""oxy and cutting an artery"") and practical inquiry about pain reduction.  
   - **Passive experience/rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - **Present intent**: Focus on method feasibility (implicit immediacy in seeking answers).  
   - No past/future markers.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit method (""cutting an artery"") + preparation (researching efficacy) → **BEHAVIOR** per rules.  
   - *Not IDEATION*: Specific method overrules non-actionable desire.  
   - *Not INDICATOR*: Active engagement with method trumps distress alone.

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Suicide references: Mentions of ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""commit suicide"" appear only as **reported speech** from the friend (""she thinks I'm going to kill myself"").  
   - Emotional markers: Distress (""hurt,"" ""not sitting well,"" ""brutal,"" ""thoughtless"") and relational conflict (""view her differently,"" ""don't want to argue"").  
   - **Absent elements**: No explicit *self-owned* suicide desire, methods, preparations, timelines, or past attempts by the writer.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **No active endorsement** of suicidal thoughts by the writer. All suicide references are attributed to the friend's perspective.  
   - Writer explicitly states they are ""doing my best to fight my mental illness,"" indicating **rejection of self-harm narratives**.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Focus is entirely on **past interpersonal conflict** (friend's comments weeks ago) and current emotional fallout. No suicidal timelines expressed.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No described suicide attempt → **not ATTEMPT**.  
   - No explicit personal intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → **not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - No expressions of active suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") → **not IDEATION**.  
   - **Distress dominates**: Hurt feelings, relational strain, and metaphorical references (""if I'd been diagnosed with cancer"") → **INDICATOR**.  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused: Ignored friend’s statements (Rule 1).  
- No temporal/behavioral escalation (Rules 2-3).  
- Self-reported efforts to ""fight mental illness"" imply rejection (Rule 4).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""jump out"" (of window)  
   - Specific method: Jumping from height, with active preparation (""cut the screen"" with scissors)  
   - Emotional markers: Distress (""help me""), helplessness (""don't know what to do"")  
   - Preparation: Actively at window with tools (""at my window right now with scissors""), describing imminent action (""about to cut the screen and jump"")  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active ownership: ""im about to cut... and jump"" shows direct personal intent.  
   - No rejection: Pleas for help imply ambivalence but **no disavowal** of intent (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Immediacy: ""right now"" and ""about to"" signal active, in-progress crisis.

   - Specific method: ""overdose on iron pills"" (pills as means)  
   - Preparation implied: Statement ""i'm gonna"" indicates intent to act  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""i'm gonna overdose"" shows ownership of intent (no disavowal).  
   - No rejection: Apology (""i'm sorry"") doesn’t negate intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present intent: ""gonna"" implies imminent action (non-specific but immediate context).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""im going to kill myself one day"" (direct statement).  
   - Indirect death references: ""just want to disappear,"" ""run away to a forest and fucking die.""  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), worthlessness (""i dont have money... nothing""), unbearable pain (abusive parents, bullying).

   - b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy? Intent exists, but lacks method specificity (""die"" in forest is vague) or immediacy (""one day"" ≠ imminent) → **Not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy? Yes (""kill myself one day"") → **IDEATION**.  
   - d) Only distress/rejected thoughts? No—active desire overrides metaphorical/rejected elements.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep.

I'm so hyperaware of how I'm clearly defective and unfit to be alive. It's like I have a terminal illness no one recognizes. I just have to pray for some random person to murder me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post includes phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" and ""end it all,"" which are direct references to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: There are multiple indirect references, such as ""hoping to be murdered,"" ""wishing that someone will just end my life for me,"" ""pray for some random person to murder me,"" and ""terminally suicidal,"" all expressing a desire for death without self-action.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""losing more hope,"" ""life is so sisyphean,"" ""vicious cycle""), worthlessness (""useless I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive""), and unbearable pain (""prolonging my suffering,"" ""crying myself to sleep,"" ""tearing up randomly"").
- **Specific methods**: No self-initiated methods are described (e.g., pills, hanging). References to methods like murder or assisted suicide are external and not actionable by the writer.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations for self-harm. Mentions of ""walk through sketchy areas every night"" reflect passive hope for external harm, not active preparation for suicide.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts. Statements like ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" and ""because of my cowardice with killing myself"" indicate no history of self-harm actions.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer explicitly owns suicidal thoughts, e.g., ""I hate being alive,"" ""how much I want to die,"" and ""to just end it all."" This shows active desire for death.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not presented as intrusive; they are consciously owned and expressed.
- **Rejection noted**: There is explicit disavowal of action: ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" and ""because of my cowardice with killing myself."" This rejection downgrades the intent, as the writer states an inability to act despite the desire.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide attempts. Mentions of past decisions (""decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral"") relate to life events, not self-harm.
- **Present intent**: No immediate plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") for self-harm. Expressions like ""every day"" and ""prolonging my suffering"" indicate ongoing, non-specific distress.
- **Future ideation**: Desire for death is vague and non-actionable, centered on passive outcomes (e.g., hoping for murder or assisted suicide) without a concrete personal plan.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No described attempt → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** Explicit intent is present, but no specific self-harm method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Desire is present (""want to die""), but rejection of action (""don't have the bravery"") and no plan/immediacy → However, Rule 4 (rejection downgrade) applies due to disavowal, so not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post includes:
  - General distress: Hopelessness, worthlessness, and emotional pain.
  - Metaphors: ""life is so sisyphean,"" ""terminal illness,"" ""vicious cycle.""
  - Rejected thoughts: Explicit disavowal of acting on suicidal desires.
  - NO actionable suicide intent: Despite suicidal desire, it is passive and externally focused (e.g., hoping for murder), with no self-driven plan or capability.
  → Classification: INDICATOR (per Rule 4: rejection downgrades to indicator).

### Final Classification Rationale
- The writer expresses suicidal desire but explicitly rejects self-action due to ""cowardice,"" aligning with INDICATOR's definition of ""rejected thoughts"" and ""distress without actionable suicide intent.""
- Irreducible Rule 4 applies: ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself"" is a disavowal equivalent to ""I don't actually want to,"" downgrading to indicator.
- Temporal hierarchy and immediacy rules do not override, as there is no past attempt, behavior, or imminent threat.
- Output is exactly one category: INDICATOR.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The writer states, ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" This is an explicit expression of not wanting to live, directly aligning with suicide-related language.
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life"" and ""I just wish I could donate my life"" are metaphorical and indirect, implying a desire to cease existing or transfer life, but not describing death concretely.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness and worthlessness are evident: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I would be making lots of people happy"" suggest pervasive despair and self-devaluation.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or descriptions of how the writer might act on their feelings.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or other preparatory actions.
- **Past actions**: The writer mentions being ""suicidal like me some time ago,"" but this is vague and does not describe a concrete past attempt (e.g., no use of ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or details of self-harm). References to the other person's experiences (e.g., ""he lost his mother,"" ""he was suicidal"") are ignored per Rule 1 (writer-focused).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" is an active, first-person claim of suicidal desire. The writer takes ownership of these thoughts without presenting them as involuntary or external.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggests intrusive thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: There is no explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"" or similar rejection). The wish to ""donate my life"" is metaphorical and altruistic but does not negate the active desire not to live.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: References to being suicidal ""some time ago"" are historical and lack detail about actions or timing. No past attempt is described.
- **Present intent**: The statement ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" is present-tense, but there is no indication of a plan, method, or imminent timeline (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific timeframe).
- **Future ideation**: The wish to donate life (""I wish I could"") is hypothetical and non-specific, with no actionable timeline.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. The writer's vague reference to past suicidality does not describe an actual attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or details of self-harm), so ATTEMPT is ruled out.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal desire (""don't want to live"") is present, but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight""), so BEHAVIOR is ruled out.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes. The core statement ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" is an explicit wish to die, and the metaphorical content (e.g., ""donate my life"") does not introduce a plan or immediacy. This aligns with IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No. While distress and metaphors are present, the explicit suicidal desire (""don't want to live"") prevents this from being solely INDICATOR.

### Category Definitions and Rules Verification
- **IDEATION**: Defined as ""active suicidal desire without actionable plan,"" which matches the explicit wish to die (""don't want to live"") without evidence of planning, preparation, or immediacy.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  1. Writer-focused: Ignored mentions of the other person's suicidality.
  2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so ideation stands.
  3. Immediacy trumps: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to escalate to behavior.
  4. Rejection downgrade: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") to downgrade to indicator.
  5. One output: IDEATION is selected.

79,"I'm ready to die. I got into a physical altercation today and I'm tired of it. I'm tired of working on healing because it's a fucking joke. Family is a fucking joke. I'm stopping all my meds today. No more antidepressants, no more anti anxiety, no more blood pressure meds. I'm quitting therapy. Talk about a waste of time and energy. Fuck weight loss. Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I'm ready to die"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent. ""Hope it all ends soon"" expresses a desire for death, reinforcing suicidal ideation.
   - Indirect death references: ""Soda and junk will kill me faster"" indicates self-destructive behavior that could hasten death, and ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"" implies a passive wish for fatal harm.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""tired of working on healing because it's a fucking joke,"" ""Family is a fucking joke,"" ""waste of time and energy"") and worthlessness are evident.
   - Specific methods: No explicit mention of traditional suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging). However, stopping medications (antidepressants, anti-anxiety, blood pressure meds) can be interpreted as a passive method to induce harm or death.
   - Preparations: ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" and ""I'm quitting therapy"" are active preparations that remove protective factors and increase risk, demonstrating capability for self-harm.
   - Past actions: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I'm ready to die"") and takes direct actions (stopping meds, quitting therapy) that align with this intent. No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or unwanted.
   - Passive experience: No indications that thoughts are passive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" phrasing).
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Instead, actions support the desire to die.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: None; all content is current or future-oriented.
   - Present intent: ""I'm stopping all my meds today"" specifies immediate action with ""today,"" indicating an imminent timeline. ""I'm quitting therapy"" also implies current enactment.
   - Future ideation: ""Hope it all ends soon"" and ""Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid"" suggest non-specific future timing, but these are secondary to the present actions.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""ready to die"") is present. Paired with preparation (stopping meds, quitting therapy) and immediate timeline (""today"") → Matches BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire is present, but it is not ""without plan/immediacy"" due to preparations and timeline → Does not qualify for IDEATION.
   - d) Distress is evident, but there are expressions of active suicidal desire and preparation → Does not qualify for INDICATOR.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:
   - Writer-focused: All content refers to the writer's own actions and feelings; no mentions of others.
   - Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
   - Immediacy trumps: ""today"" establishes immediacy, elevating it from IDEATION to BEHAVIOR.
   - Rejection downgrade: No rejection of suicidal thoughts; actions confirm intent.
   - Output exactly one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable category.

**FINAL CATEGORY JUSTIFICATION**: The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent (""ready to die"") combined with concrete preparations (stopping medications, quitting therapy) and an immediate timeline (""today""). This meets the BEHAVIOR definition: ""Intent + Capability,"" where preparations qualify even if methods are indirect. The self-destructive actions (e.g., stopping blood pressure meds) and expressed hope for death reinforce this classification. Although there are passive elements (e.g., hoping for COVID), they do not override the active intent and preparations.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""suicide"", ""kill myself"", or ""end my life"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I just want to disappear"" is a metaphorical reference to escaping pain, but it is not a clear death-related phrase (e.g., ""not wake up"" or ""be gone""). ""Be free from all this pain"" suggests relief from suffering, which could imply death indirectly, but it is not explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, and pain are present: ""broken remainings of my soul"" and ""all this pain"" convey deep despair and worthlessness.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past attempts (e.g., ""tried to"", ""attempted"", or ""overdosed"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer expresses a personal desire (""I just want to disappear"") but does not explicitly claim ownership of suicidal thoughts. The language is focused on escape and relief from pain, not active suicide.
- **Passive experience**: No indication that thoughts are presented as intrusive (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). However, the absence of active suicidal language and the metaphorical framing suggest no actionable intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No specific or non-specific timing for suicidal action (e.g., ""someday""). The post expresses a current state of distress without future-oriented suicidal planning.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No mention of any past attempt → Rule out ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: No explicit suicide intent (e.g., ""want to die"") is present. ""Want to disappear"" is metaphorical and not explicit. No method, preparation, or imminent timeline → Rule out BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""don't deserve to live""). The desire to ""disappear"" is distress-based and metaphorical → Rule out IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: The core content is distress (""broken remainings of my soul"", ""pain""), metaphors (""disappear""), and no rejected thoughts. There is no expression of active suicidal desire → Matches INDICATOR.

### Category Alignment
- **INDICATOR definition**: Fits perfectly—distress, hopelessness, metaphorical death references (""disappear""), and no actionable suicide intent. The clarification confirms that phrases like ""want to disappear"" without explicit suicide context are indicators.
- **Irreducible Rules**: 
  - Writer-focused: Content is solely about the writer's feelings.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No higher-level category (attempt/behavior) applies.
  - Immediacy trumps: No immediacy mentioned.
  - Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, but the lack of explicit intent supports INDICATOR.
  - Output one category: INDICATOR is the best fit.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are directly stated.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"").
- **Emotional markers**: Implied distress in ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" but no explicit hopelessness or worthlessness descriptors.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: ""I just need a plan for suicide"" indicates contemplation of planning but no evidence of acquired means, written notes, or location scouting.
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts, framed as a direct, personal question. The PS (""I just need a plan"") further confirms active engagement with suicidal ideation.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The rhetorical question invites persuasion but does not reject the idea.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Absent (no descriptions of prior actions).
- **Present intent**: ""I just need a plan"" suggests current contemplation but lacks immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). ""Goodnight"" implies no immediate action.
- **Future ideation**: Dominant theme—non-specific timing for suicidal action, as planning is needed but not yet acted upon.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** → No mention, so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** → Explicit intent is present (""kill myself"", ""suicide""), but no specific method, preparation evidence, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""plan"" is needed, not in place; no time-bound words like ""tonight""). Thus, not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → Yes: Desire is explicit (""Why shouldn't I kill myself!""), and the need for a plan confirms lack of actionable steps or immediacy. Matches IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → No: Explicit suicidal desire overrules this; no metaphors (e.g., ""disappear"") or rejection.

### Category-Specific Checks:
- **Indicator**: Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts.
- **Ideation**: Fits—active desire (""want to die"" equivalent) with no plan or immediacy per key boundary (""need a plan"" implies non-actionable contemplation).
- **Behavior**: Not met—requires method, preparation, or immediacy, none present.
- **Attempt**: Not applicable—no past actions described.

### Irreducible Rules Validation:
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis centers on the user's own statements (e.g., ""I kill myself"", ""I just need a plan"").
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt or behavior overrules; IDEATION stands.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection (e.g., ""I don't want to"") to downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one category**: IDEATION is the clearest fit.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- Explicit suicide references: ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""blow my brains out"".  
- Indirect death references: ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (tied to past attempt).  
- Emotional markers: Distress (""am I crazy?""), loss of control (""uncontrollably"").  
- Specific methods: Firearm simulation (""putting a finger gun in my mouth"").  
- Preparations: Rehearsal gesture (finger gun).  
- Past actions: Explicit reference to ""my most recent failed attempt"".  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- Statements framed as involuntary (""almost uncontrollably"", ""like Tourettes"").  
- No active endorsement of *current* intent (seeking relatability, not declaring plans).  
- No explicit rejection (e.g., ""but I won’t do it""), but context implies compulsive expression.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- Past: Confirmed suicide attempt (""most recent failed attempt"").  
- Present: Recurrent intrusive phrases/gestures, but not stated as active intent.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- Start → **a) Past suicide attempt described?** YES (""failed attempt"").  
- → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
- *Irreducible Rule #2*: ""Attempt"" overrides concurrent ideation/behavior.  

**Key Verifications:**  
- Writer-focused: All references are to the user’s own actions.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Past attempt takes precedence over present gestures (which alone would be ""behavior"").  
- No downgrade: Lack of active endorsement is irrelevant due to attempt disclosure.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal desire: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""suicidal"" show ownership of thoughts.  
   - **No rejection or disavowal** (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present-focused: Describes current despair (""I hate my life"") and non-specific timing (""anymore"" implies ongoing state).  
   - **No imminent timeline** (e.g., ""tonight"") or future plans.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - → No past attempt described → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - → Explicit desire (""don’t want to live"") but **no method/preparation/immediate timeline** → **Not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - → Explicit suicide desire (""don’t want to live"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - **Explicit suicide references**: ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"", ""thought about suicide"".  
   - **Indirect death references**: ""want to collapse and let go"" (metaphorical).  
   - **Emotional markers**: ""crushed and empty"", ""too hard"", ""false hope"", ""pain"".  
   - **Methods/preparations/past actions**: None specified. No mention of plans, means, timelines, or prior attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Describes suicidal thoughts passively (""my suicidal thoughts get stronger"") rather than claiming ownership (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - **Rejection noted**: Implicit rejection via ""help me please"" and hope to ""power through"", but no explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - References ongoing suicidal thoughts (""majority of the time"") but **no imminent timeline** (e.g., ""tonight""). Focuses on past neutral feelings and current distress without future action plan.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""planning to **kill myself**""  
   - Temporal marker: ""**tonight**"" (imminent timeline)

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: Yes, ""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"" directly mentions suicide as a considered solution.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I need to leave"" is vague and could imply death, but it is not a clear reference (e.g., not ""be gone"" or ""not wake up""). It is contextualized by the explicit suicide mention.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't belong here""), worthlessness/guilt (""make myself suffer extraordinary pain for the decisions I've made""), and a sense of being trapped (""led me to where I am now"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No references to prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I'm starting to think suicide is the only thing"") and personalizes suffering (""I need to make myself suffer""). There is no framing as passive or intrusive.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The language (""only thing that even come close to sufficing"") suggests acceptance of suicide as a solution.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: References past decisions (""decisions I've made in my past""), but suicidal ideation is current (""I'm starting to think"").
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing (""starting to think"" implies consideration without urgency).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past attempt described?** → No. Proceed.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** → Explicit intent is present (""suicide is the only thing""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → Yes. Desire is explicit (""suicide is the only thing""), and there is no actionable plan or immediacy. Matches IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Not applicable, as explicit suicide desire is present.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Excluded because explicit suicidal desire is present, and there is no rejection of thoughts.
- **Ideation**: Fits—active suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) without plan or immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Not met—lacks method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt**: Not met—no past actions described.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: All content relates to the writer; no others mentioned.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt or behavior overrules; IDEATION is appropriate.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection; thoughts are endorsed.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is the clear fit.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""finally do it"" (referencing suicide), ""deserves to die"".  
   - Specific method: ""hanging myself"".  
   - Preparations: Repeatedly ""practicing hanging,"" training to ""break survival instinct"".  
   - Emotional markers: ""worthless trash,"" ""no turning it around,"" ""pain and this fucking shit life"".  
   - No past attempts described (only preparatory actions).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Strong ownership (""I will succeed,"" ""the thought makes me so happy"").  
   - No rejection: Explicitly rejects intervention (""don’t want anyone to take this away from me"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present preparation: Actively practicing now.  
   - Future intent: ""can’t wait for the day"" (non-immediate) but paired with ongoing actionable steps.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - **Explicit intent (""do it"") + specific method (hanging) + active preparation (practicing, training) → BEHAVIOR**.  
   - Immediacy (""tonight"") absent, but preparation evidence overrides per rules (""Critical expansion"" in Behavior definition).  
   - Ideation ruled out due to presence of method/preparation.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die""  
   - Emotional markers: Worthlessness (""piece of shit""), guilt (""I hate people who yell... and I am one""), hopelessness (""all I can think of""), fear of harming others  
   - Death metaphors: ""disappear""  
   - Preparations/timeline: ""if not tonight one day I will take myself away"" (non-specific future intent, no method/prep details)  
   - No methods, preparations, or past attempts described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal desire (""I want to die"")  
   - No rejection of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"")  
   - ""Take myself away"" implies intent but lacks actionable specificity  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Primary focus: Future ideation (""one day I will"")  
   - ""If not tonight"" acknowledges possible immediacy but explicitly defers action  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   a) No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   b) Explicit intent (""want to die"") + vague timeline (""one day"") + no method/prep → **Not BEHAVIOR**  
   c) Explicit desire (""want to die"") with no plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**  
   d) Metaphors (""disappear"") alone would be INDICATOR, but overruled by explicit suicidal desire  

**Irreducible Rules Application**:  
- ""I want to die"" establishes active suicidal ideation  
- ""Tonight"" is conditional (""if not tonight"") and deferred → no immediacy  
- No rejection phrases to downgrade to indicator  
- Temporal hierarchy: Future ideation without plan/prep → IDEATION

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains phrases like ""I just don't want to exist,"" which could be tangentially related to suicide, but the writer explicitly states, ""Im not suicidal or something"" and ""I think that suicide is selfish,"" directly rejecting and disavowing suicidal intent. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live"" are used in an affirmative context.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I just don't want to exist"" may imply a metaphorical desire to disappear, but it is not a clear reference to death (e.g., ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of distress, hopelessness, and worthlessness are present, such as ""I feel like trash,"" ""I don't have any purpose in life,"" ""I feel like disapointment [sic],"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore."" General unhappiness and despair are evident.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, hanging, jumping, or firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts, self-harm, or statements like ""tried to"" or ""attempted."" The writer only references past events like anxiety attacks and lockdown struggles, unrelated to suicidal behavior.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: There is no active ownership of suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" is presented as a feeling of despair, but it is immediately countered by explicit disavowal (""Im not suicidal or something"" and calling suicide ""selfish""), indicating rejection rather than endorsement.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not framed as intrusive (e.g., no language like ""my brain tells me to die""). The distress is described as a persistent emotional state.
- **Rejection noted**: Clear and explicit rejection is present, with the writer distancing themselves from suicidal intent. This satisfies the ""rejection downgrade"" rule, which mandates downgrading to a lower-risk category when disavowal occurs.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicidal actions. Mentions of historical events (e.g., lockdown, anxiety attacks) are contextual to general distress, not suicide.
- **Present intent**: No expressions of current plans, immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), or capability for suicide.
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific suicidal ideation (e.g., ""someday I might""). The writer's focus is on venting present feelings without future-oriented suicidal thoughts.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent (rejected), no method, no preparation, no immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** The phrase ""don't want to exist"" is not explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""want to die"") and is rejected. With disavowal, it does not qualify as active ideation → Not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The core content is general distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphorical references (""don't want to exist""), and explicit rejection of suicide. This aligns with INDICATOR, as there is no actionable suicide intent.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis is confined to the writer's experiences; no mentions of others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No evidence of attempt, behavior, or ideation, so hierarchy not invoked.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Explicit disavowal (""Im not suicidal or something"") downgrades any ambiguous language to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: INDICATOR is the best fit.

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>

- Temporal hierarchy: Described attempt (past action) supersedes concurrent ideation/behavior.  
- Clarification: ""Stopped"" still qualifies as an interrupted attempt.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"", ""suicide""
   - Indirect death references: None (phrases like ""too tired of life"" imply despair but not death-specific metaphors)
   - Emotional markers: ""scared"", ""too tired of life"" (hopelessness/exhaustion)
   - Specific methods: None mentioned
   - Preparations: None described
   - Past actions: None indicated (no ""tried"" or ""attempted"")

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Expresses desire (""kill myself"") but explicitly rejects acting due to fear (""too scared to kill myself"") and legal consequences.
   - Passive experience/rejection: Clear disavowal of action (""too scared...""), framing suicide as a hypothetical risk (""if I fail"") rather than intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - No past actions (no attempt described).
   - No present intent or timeline (lacks ""tonight"", ""now"").
   - Future ideation implied but explicitly negated by fear/consequences.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - ❌ No past attempt → Rules out ATTEMPT.
   - ❌ Explicit suicide desire (""kill myself"") BUT disavowed action + no method/preparation/immediacy → Rules out BEHAVIOR.
   - ❌ Explicit suicide desire present, but downgraded by rejection rule (""too scared to kill myself"") → Cannot classify as IDEATION per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade).
   - ✅ ONLY distress (""scared"", ""tired of life"") + rejected explicit thoughts → Matches INDICATOR criteria.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""end this bullshit for good"" (contextually implies suicide).  
   - Indirect death references: ""We start dying the second we are born"" (metaphorical).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""miserable lives,"" ""rotting away,"" ""human life has no purpose"").

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: None (no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.).  
- **Indirect death references**: ""wish I could get hit by a car or od on meds.""  
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""no one left to turn to""), worthlessness (""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over""), numbness (""don't feel like anything"").  
- **Specific methods**: ""od on meds"" (overdosing).  
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no note, acquired pills).  
- **Past actions**: None (no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: Desire for death is explicit (""wish I could get hit by a car or od"") but framed as a passive wish, not an active plan.  
- **Rejection noted?**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- **Past**: Failing classes, arguments with parents (context, not suicide-related).  
- **Present**: Current despair (""have no one left,"" ""spend time in my room"").  
- **Future**: Non-specific timing (""wish I could"" implies hypothetical/unscheduled).  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- **a) Past attempt?** → No.  
- **b) Explicit intent + method/immediacy?** → Explicit death wish (""wish I could"") and method (""od on meds""), but *no preparation/immediate timeline* (e.g., ""tonight""). → **Does not meet Behavior threshold**.  
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** → Yes (""wish I could die"" + method mention lacking specificity/timeline).  
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?** → No, due to active death wish.  

**Key Boundaries:**  
- ""od on meds"" is a method reference but lacks actionable context (e.g., ""I have pills ready"").  
- ""Wish"" language and absence of immediacy/preparation → **Ideation**.  
- Hopelessness/numbness support distress but don’t override explicit suicidal desire.

Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way.

I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. The post contains no phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
- **Indirect death references**: None. There are no allusions to death, such as ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die."" The phrase ""I would fucking jump out of bed every morning"" is metaphorical (expressing enthusiasm in a hypothetical scenario) and unrelated to self-harm.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, and despair are present, e.g., ""the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body,"" ""Being unwanted in literally all facets of life,"" and ""appearance... has by far the biggest difference in ones life."" These indicate severe distress and feelings of entrapment.
- **Specific methods**: None. No mention of pills, hanging, jumping (as self-harm), firearms, or other suicide methods.
- **Preparations**: None. No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: None. No references to past suicide attempts, such as ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or ""overdosed.""

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses anger, envy, and frustration (""go fuck yourself"" to attractive people) but does not state a personal desire to die or engage in self-harm.
- **Passive experience**: No description of intrusive suicidal thoughts. The focus is on external circumstances (appearance) rather than internal cognitive processes related to suicide.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts because suicide is not mentioned. The writer rejects the validity of others' depression but not their own suicidal ideation, as none is present.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicidal actions or events. Mentions of ""growing up to adulthood"" describe ongoing distress, not historical attempts.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No expressions of future suicidal desire. The hypothetical ""I would never stop smiling if I was born that way"" relates to wishing for a different life, not ending life.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent, and no method, preparation, or timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post contains distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) and metaphorical language (e.g., ""daily torture,"" ""give absolutely everything"") without actionable suicide intent. Falls under INDICATOR per the definition.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis is on the writer's own experiences; ignores mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Not triggered (no attempt or behavior).
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable (no suicidal thoughts to reject).
5. **Output exactly one**: INDICATOR is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""me being suicidal""  
   - Past actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" (direct description of attempts)  
   - Emotional markers: ""tired of people's ignorance,"" mentions of abuse and mental illness (distress)  
   - *No* active method/preparation details, *no* immediate timeline, *no* rejection of thoughts  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Ownership of suicidal state: ""me being suicidal"" (active endorsement)  
   - Past attempts confirm serious intent  
   - *No* disavowal (e.g., ""but I won’t do it again"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Exclusively past-focused: ""I've tried"" (historical attempts)  
   - *No* present/future intent (e.g., ""planning to,"" ""tonight"")  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   → **a) Past attempt described?** YES (""tried to kill myself 8 times"")  
   → **ATTEMPT** (irreducible rule: Attempt overrides all other categories)  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""Tried to"" triggers **Attempt** regardless of concurrent distress (Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy).  
- Abuse/mental illness context doesn’t override actual attempt disclosure (Rule 1: Writer-focused).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (phrases like ""kill myself"" absent).  
   - Indirect death references: ""better off dead"" (metaphorical).  
   - Emotional markers: Frustration/sadness (""makes you sad"").  
   - Methods/preparations/past actions: **None**.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - ""I say I’m better off dead"" is framed as **hypothetical/sarcastic** (contrasting others' reactions).  
   - **Rejection noted**: Context implies societal rejection (""everyone’s like no don’t do that""), and the "":D"" emoji suggests detachment. No personal ownership of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - No past, present, or future timelines for self-harm.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No attempt/behavior/ideation triggers.  
   - ""Better off dead"" is a **metaphorical expression** of distress (fits Indicator clarification).  
   - Rejected societal context and absence of actionable intent confirm **Indicator**.  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused (ignores ""they"").  
- No temporal/immediacy signals.  
- Rejection (implied societal) downgrades to Indicator.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- Explicit suicide reference: ""overdose"" (directly stated)  
- Specific method: ""took 44 paracetamol"" (pill overdose)  
- Preparation evidence: ""i took 44 paracetamol almost an hour ago"" (action completed)  
- Physical symptoms confirming ingestion: stomach pain, sweating, shaking  
- Emotional markers: ""feel like a burden"" (worthlessness)  
- Rejection noted: ""i dont think i want to die"" (explicit disavowal of intent)  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- Active ownership of action: ""i did this to myself""  
- Rejection of intent: ""i dont think i want to die"" (downgrades ideation/behavior)  
- Ambivalence: ""something is stopping me"" [from calling help] but action already taken  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- Past action: Overdose occurred ""almost an hour ago""  
- Present consequences: Physical symptoms ongoing  
- No future intent expressed  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **a)** ""took 44 paracetamol"" + ""overdose"" → **Past suicide attempt described**  
- Irreducible Rule #2 (Temporal Hierarchy): Attempt overrules all other categories.  
- Irreducible Rule #4: Rejection (""i dont think i want to die"") is irrelevant here because the physical action has already occurred.  

**Key Clarifications Applied:**  
- ""Attempt"" includes *any* description of self-harm with suicidal intent, regardless of later ambivalence.  
- ""Tried to"" or ""took [lethal means]"" → Attempt (per framework clarification).  
- Writer-focused: No mentions of others’ actions.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to end it"" is an explicit reference to suicide, as ""end it"" is a common euphemism for ending one's life (similar to ""end my life"" in the framework).
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: No explicit markers of hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain (e.g., no words like ""hopeless"" or ""worthless"").
   - Specific methods: None indicated; the post explicitly states ""I have no idea how.""
   - Preparations: None described; the post denies knowledge of how, when, or other details.
   - Past actions: No mention of prior attempts (e.g., no terms like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer directly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I want to end it,"" indicating personal desire.
   - Passive experience: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or external (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: The ""but"" in ""I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else"" expresses uncertainty about execution, not an explicit disavowal of the desire (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Therefore, the suicidal intent is not rejected.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No references to past events or attempts.
   - Present intent: Desire is stated in the present (""I want""), but no immediate timeline is specified (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: The lack of specificity (""no idea how, when or anything else"") indicates non-specific, future-oriented ideation without a concrete plan.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start: No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - Explicit suicide intent (""I want to end it"") is present, but no specific method/preparation (""no idea how"") or immediate timeline (""no idea when"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - Explicit suicide desire without plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION definition.
   - Not solely distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts (due to active suicidal desire) → Not INDICATOR.

**Key Considerations from Category Definitions**:
- **Ideation** fits: Explicit wish to die (""want to end it"") with no actionable plan (denial of method, timing, or preparation). The boundary with BEHAVIOR is maintained, as immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") is absent.
- **Irreducible Rules Compliance**:
  - Writer-focused: Post is solely about the user's own thoughts.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No higher-level category (Attempt or Behavior) applies.
  - Immediacy: Not present.
  - Rejection: No disavowal of intent; uncertainty about execution does not downgrade to Indicator.
  - Single output: Only one category selected.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: None. No phrases like ""suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end my life"", or ""not want to live"".
   - Indirect death references: None. No mentions of ""not wake up"", ""be gone"", or ""painless way to die"".
   - Emotional markers: Strong distress present, including hopelessness (""it feels completely hopeless""), worthlessness (""I feel like a robot""), and emotional pain (""I'm exhausted"", ""can't handle it anymore"", ""not fucking stable myself"").
   - Specific methods: None. No references to pills, hanging, jumping, firearms, etc.
   - Preparations: None. No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: None. No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"", ""attempted"", or ""overdosed""). The reference to ""last posted here a year ago"" describes a previous post but not a suicide-related action.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses distress (e.g., ""I'm really trying but it feels completely hopeless"") but no statements like ""I want to die"".
   - Passive experience: No suicidal thoughts presented as intrusive. The phrase ""my jackass of a brain doesn't want to allow it"" refers to an inability to enjoy life, not suicidal ideation.
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts because suicidal intent is absent. The hopelessness is general and not tied to suicide.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Mentions a previous post (""last posted here a year ago"") but only to describe ongoing distress, not a suicide attempt or history.
   - Present intent: No current plans or timelines for suicide (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The distress is described as ongoing but not actionable.
   - Future ideation: No references to future suicidal thoughts or desires.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) No explicit suicide intent, and no specific method/preparation or immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live"") → Not IDEATION.
   - d) ONLY distress (hopelessness, exhaustion, emotional overload) and metaphors (""feel like a robot"", ""overloading"") without actionable suicide intent → Matches INDICATOR.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's feelings are described; mentions of others (e.g., ""when I tell someone I need them"") are contextual to their distress.
- Temporal hierarchy: No higher-level category (Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation) applies.
- Immediacy trumps: No imminent timeline or urgency.
- Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, as suicidal thoughts are absent.
- Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is the best fit.

### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None present. Phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: One instance: ""there's nothing lower but death."" However, this is metaphorical and contextualized as part of a general statement about hitting rock bottom, not a personal expression of suicidal desire.
- **Emotional markers**: Present, including hopelessness (""feeling lonely and lost as ever,"" ""not knowing what to do wit my life""), worthlessness (implied in comparisons to an ""abusive uncle""), and past distress (""really bad depression / bipolar mental breakdowns""). But these are balanced with positive elements (""i've been overall better,"" ""starting to accept who I am,"" ""stay positive"").
- **Specific methods**: None described (e.g., no mention of pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes, scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: Mentions ""almost being abusive"" and ""puking everyday,"" but these relate to mental health struggles or behavioral issues, not suicide attempts. No terms like ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of self-harm with suicidal intent.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: No expressions of personal suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The ""death"" reference is impersonal and metaphorical.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive or unwanted suicidal thoughts described (e.g., no ""my brain tells me to die"").
- **Rejection noted**: No suicidal thoughts to reject, but the writer explicitly encourages positivity and safety (""there's always a way to improve,"" ""stay safe,"" ""luv y'all""), which indirectly disavows self-harm.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Dominates the post (e.g., ""my rock bottom was having really bad depression... for nearly 2 years,"" ""these last 2 years since I've been way better""). Describes historical distress without current crisis.
- **Present intent**: No expressions of current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"" related to self-harm). Writer states ""i've been overall better"" and is focused on acceptance.
- **Future ideation**: No suicidal thoughts, specific or non-specific. Future references are positive (""it might get better,"" ""stay safe"").

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start → 
  - a) **Past suicide attempt?** No. Mentions past mental health struggles but no description of suicidal actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicidal desire, no methods, no preparations, no imminent timeline. → Not BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., no ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live""). → Not IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post contains:
    - General distress (loneliness, confusion, past depression).
    - Metaphorical death references (""nothing lower but death"" in context of rock bottom).
    - No suicidal thoughts to reject, but writer promotes coping and safety.
    - No expressions of active suicidal desire.
    - Fits the clarification: ""I'm going to die soon"" without suicide context → indicator; similarly, ""nothing lower but death"" is non-actionable.
  → Matches INDICATOR.

### Irreducible Rules Validation
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis ignores mentions of others (e.g., ""abusive uncle"") and focuses solely on the writer's expressions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No higher-level categories (attempt, behavior, or ideation) override, as none are present.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable, but writer's positive framing supports indicator classification.
5. **Output exactly one**: INDICATOR is the only fitting category.

Final Classification: INDICATOR – Distress and metaphors are present, but no actionable suicide intent, desire, or behavior.

- **No rejection**: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Future focus**: ""right now I’m not feeling nearly as bad as I will in the future"" (non-imminent).  
- **No immediate timeline**: ""If I had"" is conditional/hypothetical, not ""tonight"" or ""now.""  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **a)** No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
- **b)** Explicit intent (""kill myself"") but lacks:  
  - Specific preparation (no gun access),  
  - Immediacy (""if"" conditional, future-oriented). → Not BEHAVIOR.  
- **c)** Explicit suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) without plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.  
- **d)** Rejected thoughts? No → Not INDICATOR.  

**Key Boundaries Applied**:  
- Conditionality (""If I had a gun"") negates capability → No BEHAVIOR.  
- Future suffering referenced, but no imminent timeline.  
- No downgrade to INDICATOR (no disavowal of intent).

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"### Applying the Framework to the User Post

**Step 1: Content Deconstruction**
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct references to suicide, such as ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago).""
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""this year has pushed me back down""), worthlessness (""I feel like a piece of crap""), and unbearable pain (""massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: Clear description of a past suicide attempt (""I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago)"").

**Step 2: Intent Analysis**
- **Active endorsement**: The writer mentions recurring suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again"") but does not express a current, active desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die now"").
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are presented as historical or recurring, but not framed as intrusive or uncontrollable in the present.
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present. The writer states, ""Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try"" and is actively seeking help (e.g., setting up appointments, confiding in wife and friend). This indicates a rejection of acting on suicidal thoughts.

**Step 3: Temporal Framework**
- **Past focus**: The suicide attempt is explicitly described as occurring ""many years ago."" Current suicidal thoughts are referenced as recurring but not tied to specific plans.
- **Present intent**: No indication of immediate plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The focus is on distress and help-seeking.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific references to thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again"") without details on timing or intent to act.

**Step 4: Category Decision Tree**
- Start at the decision tree:  
  - **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → **Yes**, the writer explicitly states a past attempt (""I have attempted suicide in the past""). This directly triggers the **ATTEMPT** category per the decision tree rule (""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
  - **Irreducible Rules Application**:  
    - Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation): The past attempt overrides any concurrent ideation (e.g., recurring thoughts).  
    - Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): While rejection of current thoughts is present (downgrading potential ideation to indicator), it does not apply here because the attempt category takes precedence.  
    - Rule 1 (Writer-focused): Only the writer's actions are considered; mentions of others (e.g., wife's support) are irrelevant.  
    - Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): No immediacy present, so no conflict.  
    - Rule 5 (Output exactly one): ATTEMPT is the highest applicable category.  

**Final Classification Reasoning**:  
- The post describes a concrete past suicide attempt, which qualifies as ATTEMPT per the category definition (""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt). This overrules the presence of recurring suicidal thoughts, which lack specificity, preparation, or immediacy (and are further mitigated by help-seeking behavior). No evidence of current behavior (e.g., plans, methods) or active ideation with intent exists. Thus, the category is ATTEMPT.

<thinking>
[Content Deconstruction: Explicit suicide references (suicidal thoughts, past attempt), emotional markers (hopelessness, worthlessness, pain), no methods/preparations, past actions (attempt described).  
Intent Analysis: Recurring thoughts but no active endorsement; rejection noted via help-seeking.  
Temporal Framework: Past attempt dominant; no present/future intent.  
Decision Tree: Past attempt → ATTEMPT; irreducible rules confirm (attempt overrules ideation, rejection doesn't downgrade attempt).]

It's pushing away the most important people in my life like my bf and I can't even bring myself to tell him that I'm suffering. I'm afraid he won't want baggage like me and leave. In which case I think I would go insane. I have so many issues that I don't tell anyone and I've never felt like that's been an option for me. I don't even open up to my best friends about my depression and thoughts of sh. I can't even cut because my bf will see, so I can't even cope in the way that works best. It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: None (""sh"" implies self-harm, not suicide).  
- **Indirect death references**: None (e.g., no ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""Dont even feel like a person,"" ""too much""), worthlessness (""baggage like me""), and isolation.  
- **Methods/preparations**: None. Mentions inability to cut (self-harm coping mechanism, not suicide method).  
- **Past actions**: None (no ""tried,"" ""attempted,"" or historical suicide behavior).  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts of self-harm (sh) are mentioned but framed as an inaccessible coping mechanism.  
- **Rejection noted**: Implicit rejection—self-harm is avoided due to consequences (""bf will see""), but no suicide ideation to reject.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Past**: No suicide-related history.  
- **Present**: Distress and frustration about coping limitations.  
- **Future**: No stated intent, timeline, or suicide ideation.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **a) Past attempt?** → No.  
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** → No explicit suicide intent.  
- **c) Explicit suicide desire?** → None (""thoughts of sh"" ≠ suicidal ideation; sh is distinct per framework).  
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. Distress dominates; self-harm thoughts are mentioned but constrained and not suicidal.  

**Key Clarifications**:  
- ""Thoughts of sh"" = self-harm, not suicide. Requires explicit suicide language (e.g., ""want to die"") for ideation.  
- Hopelessness/metaphors (""go insane"") without suicide intent → indicator.  
- No temporal urgency or preparation.

114,"Don't be sad when I die. Be happy that my pain is finally over. If you really loved me, you'd want me to be happy. The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post includes ""when I die"" and ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" These are direct references to the writer's own death, with ""dead"" explicitly linked to personal relief and happiness.
- **Indirect death references**: ""My pain is finally over"" implies death as an escape from suffering, but it is less direct.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness is evident (""the only way I can be happy is if I'm dead""), and unbearable pain is a central theme (""my pain is finally over""). Worthlessness is indirectly suggested through the appeal to others (""If you really loved me..."").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes (the post itself is not framed as a suicide note), or scouting locations. The message advises others on how to feel post-death, but this is not a concrete preparation.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims full ownership of suicidal thoughts, using first-person statements like ""I die,"" ""my pain,"" and ""I can be happy."" There is no indication these thoughts are passive or intrusive.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the post rationalizes death as desirable.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or actions.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Death is referenced non-specifically (""when I die""), indicating a future-oriented but vague timeframe. The desire for death as happiness (""if I'm dead"") is abstract and not tied to a concrete plan.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal desire is present (""the only way I can be happy is if I'm dead""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes → IDEATION is indicated. The core expression is an active wish to die to achieve happiness, with no actionable elements.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because there is explicit suicidal desire, not just general distress or metaphors. ""When I die"" is literal, not metaphorical like ""disappear,"" and there is no rejection.

**Conclusion from decision tree**: The post expresses clear suicidal desire but lacks specificity of method, preparation, or immediacy. It does not qualify for ATTEMPT (no past action), BEHAVIOR (no capability or immediacy), or INDICATOR (due to active endorsement of death as a solution). Thus, IDEATION is the appropriate category.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: All content centers on the writer (""I"" statements).
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrides.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediate timeline to elevate to behavior.
4. Rejection downgrade: No disavowal to downgrade to indicator.
5. One output: IDEATION is selected.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""kill myself"", ""I don't want to live"", ""goodbye"" (contextual finality).  
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""my life is all downhill""), worthlessness (""I have nothing in my life""), despair (""career dreams are ruined"").  
- **Method**: ""take the leap"" (implies jumping, though metaphorical phrasing).  
- **Preparations**: None explicit (e.g., no note-writing or means acquisition described).  
- **Past actions**: None mentioned.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: Clear ownership (""I finally decided to take the leap and kill myself"").  
- **Rejection noted?**: Absent. No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- **Present intent**: ""Finally decided"" + ""goodbye"" implies imminent action.  
- **Timeline**: ""About a month longer"" suggests delayed action concluding *now*.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
- Explicit intent (""kill myself"") + immediacy (""finally decided""/""goodbye"") → **BEHAVIOR** (per rule: ""immediacy trumps"").  
- *Not IDEATION*: Immediacy overrides non-specific timing.  
- *Not INDICATOR*: Active desire without rejection.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION:**  
- Writer-focused: All self-referential.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Immediacy (""goodbye"") elevates to **BEHAVIOR**.  
- No rejection: No downgrade to indicator.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""end it all"", ""call it quits"".  
   - Emotional markers: Resignation (""feel so relaxed that it's finally ending""), retrospective life evaluation (""22 years... enough"").  
   - Preparation: Playing video games ""one last time"" frames the activity as a deliberate pre-suicide act.  
   - *No* past attempts, method details, or disavowals.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - *No* rejection or framing as intrusive thoughts.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Imminent timeline: ""before i end it all"" implies action follows immediately after the current activity (gaming).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: The post describes someone else (""she"") having ""tried to kill herself,"" but there are no explicit suicide references from the writer themselves.
   - Indirect death references: None from the writer.
   - Emotional markers: The writer expresses distress (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared""), but this is concern for another person, not personal hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain related to self.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned for the writer.
   - Preparations: None from the writer.
   - Past actions: The writer references a past attempt by the friend (""she had tried to kill herself""), but no personal past actions.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer shows no ownership of suicidal thoughts or desires (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or similar).
   - Passive experience: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described by the writer.
   - Rejection noted: No suicidal thoughts to reject, as the focus is entirely on the friend's situation.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: The friend's attempt is historical (""three days ago""), but the writer has no personal past, present, or future suicidal content.
   - Present intent: None from the writer.
   - Future ideation: None from the writer.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start at decision tree:
     - a) Past suicide attempt described? The attempt is attributed to the friend, not the writer. Irreducible Rule 1 (Writer-focused) requires ignoring others' actions, so this does not apply.
     - b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy? No personal intent expressed.
     - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No personal desire.
     - d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → INDICATOR: The writer's expressions (""I need help,"" ""I'm scared"") constitute distress without actionable suicide intent. This aligns with the Indicator category, which includes general distress or concern (even if about others) without personal suicidal desire.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
- Rule 1 (Writer-focused): The friend's suicide attempt is ignored; only the writer's own content is considered.
- Rules 2-4: Not triggered, as there is no personal suicidal content to evaluate temporally or reject.
- Rule 5: Output one category—Indicator is the only applicable fit.

The post contains no personal expressions of suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. The distress is real but focused externally, falling squarely under Indicator.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I will hang myself now"" and ""that will kill me"" are direct statements of suicidal intent.  
   - Indirect death references: None prominent; the focus is on explicit actions.  
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""nobody has ever liked me""), worthlessness (""just made fun of me and used me""), and despair (""I don't want to be alone anymore"").  
   - Specific methods: ""hang myself"" specifies hanging as the method.  
   - Preparations: ""I'm now looking for something that I can tie"" indicates active acquisition of means.  
   - Past actions: Mentions of self-harm (non-suicidal) and bullying, but no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" regarding suicide).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership with ""I will hang myself now"" and ""I'm now looking,"" showing direct, personal intent without passivity.  
   - No rejection: There is no disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""); intent is reinforced by preparations.

   - Past focus: Describes historical distress (e.g., bullying, self-harm) but no past suicide attempts.  
   - Future ideation: Absent; all suicidal references are current.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt described (self-harm mentioned is not explicitly suicidal, so not ATTEMPT).  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""I will hang myself now"") paired with specific method (hanging) and preparation (""looking for something to tie""), plus immediacy (""now""). This meets criteria for BEHAVIOR.

Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny. Learn how to make nitroglycerin at home, the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts for cheap also. Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants in your local area and do your best.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""I WANT TO DIE""), which is an explicit expression of suicidal desire. Other references include ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""if you change your mind and you want to do it,"" and ""Go out with bang,"" all implying suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""Go silently into the night"" and ""Go out with bang"" are metaphorical but contextually related to death.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""you are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people""), worthlessness (""everyone hates themselves""), and fear (""you are frightened of the idea"") are present.
- **Specific methods**: Detailed methods are described, including using ""extension ladders and isolated wire cutters"" for mayhem, making ""nitroglycerin at home,"" and targeting ""power plants."" These indicate specific, violent means.
- **Preparations**: The post discusses researching methods (""the internet is your teacher, research where to find the parts""), acquiring materials (""find the parts for cheap""), and scouting locations (""Take a vacation to one of the biggest power plants"").
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts. The phrase ""you will never do it"" implies no prior action.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The opening ""I WANT TO DOIE"" shows direct ownership of suicidal desire. However, this is immediately followed by a shift to second-person perspective (""you""), where the writer distances themselves from action.
- **Passive experience**: Suicidal thoughts are framed as intrusive or coping mechanisms (""the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction"").
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavow",ideation,True
122,"Bully payback help. My best friend is getting harassed and bullied SEVERELY by a woman she doesn't even know. Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself.

With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: Present only in **quoted harassment** (""go kill yourself""). Not expressed by the writer or subject.  
   - Indirect death references: ""it's gonna be the fucking end of you"" (threat from bully, not self-referential).  
   - Emotional markers: Subject shows distress (""mentally disturbed,"" ""overwhelmed,"" tiredness, appetite loss).  
   - Methods/preparations: None described for subject.  
   - Past actions: No mention of suicide attempts by subject.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts by subject. Distress is reactive to bullying.  
   - Quoted suicidal language (""kill yourself"") is attributed to the bully and explicitly rejected by context (subject seeks help/justice).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Focus is on ongoing bullying (5 days) and current distress. No suicidal timelines (past/present/future) from subject.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No described past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - b) No explicit suicidal intent from subject + no methods/preparations → **Not BEHAVIOR**  
   - c) No expressions of active suicidal desire → **Not IDEATION**  
   - d) Distress (overwhelm, fatigue) and third-party suicide references (explicitly rejected contextually) → **INDICATOR**  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
   - Writer-focused: Ignored bully’s statements (only subject’s state matters).  
   - Quoted ""kill yourself"" downgraded to indicator per Rule 4 (externalized/rejected).  
   - No temporal/behavioral escalation.

- **Emotional markers**: ""loser, ugly, no motivation, isolated"", ""nothing to look forward to"", ""feel so alone""  
- **Preparation/premeditation**: None described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes)  
- **Past actions**: Mentions ""tried to reach out"" (help-seeking, not suicide attempt)  
- **Rejection noted**: ""holding on a bit because I have a small piece of hope""  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active ownership**: Clear personal endorsement (""I want to hang myself"")  
- **Rejection**: Explicitly counterbalanced by ""holding on"" due to hope, weakening active intent  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Present/future ideation**: ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""how much longer I could last"" (non-specific timing)  
- **No immediacy**: Absence of time-bound phrases (""tonight"", ""now"")  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
- Explicit intent (""want to hang myself"") + specific method (hanging) → **BUT** rejected by active hope + no preparation/immediacy → **Downgrade per Rule 4**  
- Falls under **IDEATION**: Explicit desire (""want to hang myself"") without imminent plan or preparation. Temporal vagueness (""how much longer"") and rejection clause prevent BEHAVIOR classification.  

**Irreducible Rules Applied**:  
- Rejection downgrade (Rule 4): Hope statement negates actionable intent.  
- No immediacy (Rule 3): ""How much longer"" implies endurance, not imminent action.

   - Past actions: ""last night I attempted once again, this makes it like what my 15th time?"" (clear description of past attempts)  
   - Emotional markers: ""still alive unfortunately,"" implied hopelessness  
   - Preparations/rejection: ""still want to attempt again, but I found one thing to live for so I guess I'll stay alive"" (explicit disavowal of imminent action)  
   - Healthcare barriers: Mentions avoiding hospitals  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of **past** intent (""attempted"")  
   - **Rejection of current action**: ""I found one thing to live for... I'll stay alive"" downgrades present intent

Final Classification: **attempt**  

**Explanation**:  
- The phrase ""last night I attempted"" is a direct report of a past suicide attempt, satisfying the Attempt category definition.  
- Concurrent ideation (""still want to attempt again"") is overruled by the temporal hierarchy (Rule #2: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation).

   - Indirect death references: ""I hope I don't wake up"" (passive)  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling""), worthlessness (""don't want to bother friends""), fear/scared  
   - Specific methods/preparations: **Absent** (no pills, locations, notes, etc.)  
   - Past actions: Implied history (""as I've done this before"") but **no description of actual suicide attempt**  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Passive experience: Death wish framed as ""hope I don't wake up"" (not active intent).  
   - Explicit rejection: ""Too scared to go all the way through,"" ""I know I'll wake up"" (disavows action).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present distress, but **no timeline** for action (""tonight,"" ""now"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**

   - ❌ No explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy.  
   - ❌ Explicit desire to die? Indirect (""hope I don't wake up"") + **rejected by self-awareness** (""I know I'll wake up"").  
   - ✅ **INDICATOR**: Distress + metaphorical death reference + explicit rejection of action.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:

I hope you don't make mistakes like me. Please take care of yourselves. Please give yourselves chances. I know after I am done doing what I need to do, I won't have anymore chances. I have ran out of chances. Goodbye.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""intent to kill myself"", ""I am going to shoot myself"", ""kill myself"" (implied in context).
- **Indirect death references**: ""I could die"", ""after I am done doing what I need to do"", ""Goodbye"".
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""I have already missed out on so much"", ""everything is gone"", ""Too late to turn back now"", ""I have ran out of chances""), worthlessness (""I want people to see what true failure is"", ""I personally believe you should've never given me your time"").
- **Specific methods**: ""shoot myself"" with explicit mention of a ""loaded gun"".
- **Preparations**: Acquiring means (""loaded gun by my side""), scouting/readiness (""writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself"" as part of a process), and evidence of final arrangements (""Every other account is gone, deleted"", ""I have no more savings, my room is empty, everything is gone"").
- **Past actions**: No actual attempt described; only past ideation (""I never did it"" refers to not acting on previous intent, not an attempt).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Strong ownership of intent (""I am going to shoot myself"", ""It's time"", ""I am not giving myself anymore chances""). No passive framing.
- **Passive experience**: None; thoughts are presented as deliberate, not intrusive.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts. Statements like ""I am going to shoot myself"" confirm active intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Historical ideation (""Been writing here since June, with the intent to kill myself. I never did it"") but no past attempt.
- **Present intent**: Imminent action indicated by ""It's time"", ""now"" in ""Not until now"", and contextual immediacy (""I'm writing this with a loaded gun by my side"", ""not sure what will happen once I post this"").
- **Future ideation**: None; all references are to immediate execution (e.g., ""I am going to shoot myself"" tied to posting the message).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No. ""I never did it"" explicitly states no past action, only ideation. → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: Yes. Explicit intent (""I am going to shoot myself""), specific method (""shoot myself"" with ""loaded gun""), preparation (""loaded gun by my side"", clearing accounts/savings), and imminent timeline (""once I post this"", ""now""). → BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?**: No, due to presence of method and immediacy.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No; active suicidal intent overrides general distress.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- Writer-focused: Content solely about the user; no irrelevant mentions of others.
- Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
- Immediacy trumps: ""once I post this"" and ""now"" indicate imminent action, elevating to BEHAVIOR.
- Rejection downgrade: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable.

**Final Category Rationale**: The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent with a specific method (firearm), concrete preparation (loaded gun present, affairs settled), and imminent timeline (action implied after posting). This meets the BEHAVIOR criteria, as immediacy and capability are established. Past ideation is noted but does not override current behavior indicators.

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None directly using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" implies intent to die.
- **Indirect death references**: ""might not wake up tomorrow"" is an indirect reference to death.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I feel so guilty""), worthlessness (""They deserve so much more than me""), and distress (""how fucked up I am"").
- **Specific methods**: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" specifies a method (overdose).
- **Preparations**: The act of taking pills indicates completed preparation/action.
- **Past actions**: ""taken a fuck load of pills"" is a past-tense description of self-harm with suicidal intent (as implied by ""might not wake up tomorrow"").

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of the action (""taken a fuck load of pills"") without framing it as passive or intrusive. The statement is declarative and personal.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of thoughts being presented as intrusive or unwanted.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Apologies (""I'm sorry"") relate to the friend's knowledge, not rejection of suicide.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: The key action (""taken"") is described in the past tense, indicating a completed event.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") are expressed; the focus is on the aftermath of a past action.
- **Future ideation**: ""might not wake up tomorrow"" refers to potential future consequences of the past action but is not standalone future ideation.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at decision tree point **a)**: Any past suicide attempt described? → **Yes**. The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" describes an actual self-harm action with clear suicidal intent (supported by ""might not wake up tomorrow""). This qualifies as a past suicide attempt under the category definitions, as it involves concrete action.  
  - *Proceed no further*: Under irreducible rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation), a described attempt overrules other categories like behavior or ideation.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: The post centers on the writer's own actions and feelings (""I,"" ""my"").
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Past attempt (described action) takes precedence.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: Not applicable, as no present immediacy overrides the past action.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of suicidal intent; the action is endorsed.
5. **Output exactly one**: Only one category is output.

**Final Classification**: The post describes a past suicide attempt with specific method (pills) and intent, meeting the ATTEMPT category definition (""Description of actual self-harm with suicidal intent"").

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""planning out my suicide"", ""go through with this"", ""can't find a reason... to continue living"".  
   - Emotional markers: ""tired of the constant struggle"", ""fear of failing an attempt once again"".  
   - Preparations: Explicitly states planning (""planning out my suicide"") and references avoiding detection (""silently reminisce"").  
   - Past actions: Confirms prior attempt (""fear of failing an attempt once again"").  
   - Specific timeline: ""beginning of the new year, come January 1st"".  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Unambiguous ownership (""I will go through with this"", ""I intend to do it right"").  
   - No rejection: Explicitly rejects seeking help (""no intention of anyone stopping me"") but affirms self-harm intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past: Confirms prior suicide attempt (""failing an attempt once again"").  
   - Future: Specific plan for January 1st.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - **Step a)**: Past attempt explicitly mentioned → **ATTEMPT** (trumps all other categories per temporal hierarchy rule).  
   - *Even with concurrent planning/timeline, ""attempt"" overrides behavior/ideation*.

For now i guess i will just sit here and wish i was never born.,1,ideation,"### Thinking Process

I will systematically analyze the user's post using the provided framework to determine the appropriate suicide risk category.

#### 1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**
   - **Explicit suicide references**: The post includes phrases like ""do not want to live anymore,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""do it now,"" which directly reference suicide.
   - **Indirect death references**: ""wish I was never born"" implies a desire for non-existence, which is indirect but related to death ideation.
   - **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I actually hate being alive"") and worthlessness (feeling like a burden: ""weigh down my family and friends"").
   - **Specific methods**: No mention of concrete methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or locations; references are general (""kill myself"").
   - **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no use of ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of actions).

#### 2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**
   - **Active endorsement**: The writer expresses active suicidal desire with statements like ""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore"" and ""I actually hate being alive,"" indicating ownership of suicidal thoughts.
   - **Passive experience**: There is no indication that thoughts are presented as intrusive or external (e.g., no phrases like ""my brain tells me"").
   - **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present: ""but I am too scared to kill myself"" and ""I don't want to weigh down my family and friends."" The concluding statement, ""For now I guess I will just sit here,"" reinforces a rejection of immediate action. This downgrades the risk, as per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade).

#### 3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
   - **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts; all content is current or future-oriented.
   - **Present intent**: The phrase ""wonder if I should just do it now"" suggests a fleeting thought about immediate action, but it is conditional (""if I wait for later it will just hurt them more"") and speculative (""wonder""), not a definitive plan.
   - **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing is implied in ""if I wait for later,"" but there is no concrete future plan. The overall tone (e.g., ""For now I guess I will just sit here"") indicates a lack of immediacy.

#### 4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
   - Start the decision tree:
     - **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
     - **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** Explicit intent is present (""do not want to live,"" ""kill myself,"" ""do it now""), but:
       - No specific method or preparation is described.
       - ""Do it now"" suggests potential immediacy, but it is framed as a hypothetical (""wonder if I should"") and is explicitly rejected due to fear and concern for others (""too scared,"" ""don't want to weigh down""). Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps) does not apply here because the immediacy is not firm—it is negated by the rejection. Thus, BEHAVIOR is not met.
     - **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** There is explicit desire (""do not want to live,"" ""hate being alive""), but Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade) applies due to the disavowal (""too scared to kill myself,"" ""I don't want to weigh down my family""). This disqualifies IDEATION because the rejection indicates the thoughts are not actionable.
     - **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** The core of the post involves distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphorical death references (""wish I was never born""), and rejected suicidal thoughts (""too scared to kill myself""). Since there is no actionable suicidal desire or plan, this falls under INDICATOR.

**Key Considerations from Irreducible Rules**:
- **Rule 1 (Writer-focused)**: All references are to the writer's own thoughts; no mentions of others.
- **Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy)**: No past attempt, so no override.
- **Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps)**: ""Do it now"" is not definitive due to rejection; thus, it doesn't trigger BEHAVIOR.
- **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: Explicit disavowal (""too scared to kill myself"") downgrades the classification from IDEATION to INDICATOR.
- **Rule 5 (Output exactly one)**: Only one category applies.

**Final Classification Rationale**: The post expresses suicidal ideation and distress but includes clear rejection of action due to fear and concern for others. There is no evidence of specific plans, preparations, or past attempts. Per the framework, this fits INDICATOR, defined as ""distress without actionable suicide intent"" and including ""rejected/intrusive thoughts.""

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""attempt suicide"", ""hang myself"", ""don't die""  
   - Specific method: Hanging (with chair/elevated object setup)  
   - Preparation: Systematic setup (leaving a standing object)  
   - Past actions: ""frequently"" describes repeated behavior  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Writer claims direct involvement (""**I** hang myself"")  
   - No rejection: No disavowal of intent (ambivalence implied by ""half heartedly"" but actions still executed)  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: ""frequently"" and consistent past-tense descriptions (""attempt"", ""hang"", ""stand"")  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start → **a) Past suicide attempt described?**  
     - ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"" + detailed description of hanging method → **ATTEMPT**  
     - *Overrules other categories* per temporal hierarchy rule  

**Key Verifications**:  
- Irreducible Rule 2: ""Attempt"" category overrides concurrent ideation/behavior  
- Clarification: ""Attempted"" always → attempt, includes aborted/interrupted acts (""don't die"" via safety measure)  
- Writer-focused: Describes only the author's actions

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I've been suicidal for about 6 years now,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore.""  
   - Past actions: ""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out,"" ""After that I had a few close calls but never succeed.""  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I see no point anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me""), worthlessness (""all I ended up being is a lonely kid""), and despair (""Im stuck. In alone"").  
   - **No** specific methods, preparations, or immediate timelines for current suicide plans.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Past actions are actively endorsed (""I had an attempt"").  
   - Current statements (""I don't want to go on"") reflect passive despair without active planning or imminent intent.  
   - **No rejection** of suicidal thoughts, but no active plans or capability statements.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past focus**: Detailed description of a suicide attempt at age 14 and subsequent ""close calls.""  
   - Present statements (""I don't want to go on"") are non-specific ideation without timeframe.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start → **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → YES (""I had an attempt when I was 14"").  
   → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
   - **Rules applied**:  
     - Temporal hierarchy (Attempt > other categories): The clear past attempt overrules concurrent non-specific ideation.  
     - Writer-focused: All references are to the writer’s own actions.

   - Specific methods: ""hang myself"", ""start cutting again"" (linked to increasing COVID risk for death).  
   - Preparation: ""figured out how to properly hang myself"".

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""tried to drown myself"", ""tried to hang"", ""tried to jump off from the 4th floor"".

**Step 1: Content Deconstruction**
- Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" (stated twice), ""suicide"" (e.g., ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15"").
- Indirect death references: ""I would have been gone"" (hypothetical past).
- Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Living is not for me"", ""Living is just so frustrating""), worthlessness (implied by frustration with self, e.g., ""sensitive af"", ""doing nothing""), and unbearable pain (""crippling anxiety"", ""burned out"").
- Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, etc.).
- Preparations: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, notes, or locations).
- Past actions: Reference to age 15 (""I would have been gone when I was 15"") is hypothetical (""if suicide wasn't damn hard"") and does not describe an actual attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

**Step 2: Intent Analysis**
- Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"", ""I might actually get the courage to do it"") without framing them as intrusive or unwanted.
- Passive experience: No evidence of intrusive thoughts; suicidal ideation is presented as self-driven.
- Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); instead, ideation is reinforced as ""the only positive thing"".

**Step 3: Temporal Framework**
- Past focus: Hypothetical reference to age 15 (""I would have been gone"") indicates past ideation, not actual action.
- Present intent: Current suicidal desire expressed (""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself"").
- Future ideation: Non-specific timing (""I might actually get the courage to do it""); no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"").

**Step 4: Category Decision Tree**
- a) Past attempt described? No—hypothetical statement (""would have been gone"") does not qualify as an attempt; no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"". → Not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit intent + (method/prep OR immediacy)? Explicit intent present (""kill myself""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). → Not BEHAVIOR.
- c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes—clear wish to die (""kill myself"", ""suicide"") with non-actionable future timing (""might"") and no plan details. → IDEATION.
- d) ONLY distress/rejected thoughts? No—explicit suicidal desire overrules general distress or metaphors.

**Category Rule Application:**
- Irreducible Rules: 
  - Writer-focused: All content is self-referential.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so ideation stands.
  - Immediacy trumps: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
  - Rejection downgrade: No disavowal—ideation is actively endorsed.
  - Output one category: IDEATION is consistent with explicit desire lacking specificity.

**Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- Explicit suicide references: ""be dead"" directly implies suicide.  
- Indirect death references: None beyond explicit.  
- Emotional markers: ""pain is too much"" indicates unbearable emotional pain and hopelessness.  
- Specific methods: ""Trazodone and alcohol"" specified as means for overdose.  
- Preparations: ""I have enough Trazodone"" (acquired means) and ""will get alcohol today"" (active preparation).  
- Past actions: No description of past attempts (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""attempted"").  

**Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership with definitive statements (""I have,"" ""will get,"" ""be dead""), showing personal intent without ambiguity.  
- Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; intent is presented as deliberate.  
- Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); intent is affirmed.  

**Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- Past focus: None; ""got to the point"" describes current state, not past actions.  
- Present intent: ""will get alcohol today"" and ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" indicate imminent timeline (within 24 hours).  
- Future ideation: Not applicable due to specificity and immediacy.  

**Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
- b) Explicit suicide intent (""be dead in less than 24 hours"") is present, paired with specific method (Trazodone/alcohol) and preparation (acquiring means). Imminent timeline (""less than 24 hours"") meets criteria for immediacy (similar to ""tonight""). → BEHAVIOR.  
- c) Not IDEATION, as active desire is coupled with plan and immediacy.  
- d) Not INDICATOR, due to actionable intent and absence of rejection.  

**Irreducible Rules Application:**  
- Writer-focused: Content centers on the writer's own actions/intent.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence.  
- Immediacy trumps: ""Less than 24 hours"" qualifies as immediate.  
- Rejection downgrade: No rejection; intent is explicit.  
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable.

   - **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - **Passive experience**: Negative thoughts are framed as burdensome (""tired of obsessive negative thoughts"") but lack suicidal framing.

I think if I slowly kill myself this way it will give people plenty of time to adjust and accept the idea that I'm going to die. (Maybe cushion the pain idk. )I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die.",1,ideation,"### Analysis Using the Framework

**Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**
- **Explicit suicide references**: Present. The post includes direct phrases like ""kill myself"" (used twice), ""for it to finally kill me,"" and ""I'm going to die."" These indicate clear suicidal intent.
- **Indirect death references**: Present. ""Let myself pass away"" and ""going to die"" are indirect but reinforce the suicidal context.
- **Emotional markers**: Present. Hopelessness is evident in the resigned tone (e.g., ""it will give people plenty of time to adjust""), worthlessness is implied by the desire to ""look like a fucking skeleton,"" and unbearable pain is suggested through the focus on cushioning others' pain.
- **Specific methods**: Present. The method is explicitly stated as self-starvation via anorexia, with details on weight goals (current 90 pounds, target 78 pounds or lower to achieve death). This constitutes a specific, planned method of self-harm.
- **Preparations**: Present. The user describes active preparations: setting a ""new goal weight"" of 78 pounds, considering going lower to ensure lethality, and framing this as a slow process to facilitate death. This shows concrete steps toward suicide.
- **Past actions**: Absent. No mention of previous suicide attempts (e.g., no words like ""tried"" or ""attempted"").

**Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS**
- **Active endorsement**: Strongly present. The writer claims direct ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I'm going to let myself pass away,"" ""I want to look like a fucking skeleton when I die""). There is no ambiguity; the intent is personal and deliberate.
- **Passive experience**: Absent. No language suggests intrusive thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Absent. The parenthetical ""(Maybe cushion the pain idk.)"" rationalizes the plan rather than disavowing it. There is no explicit rejection (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

**Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
- **Past focus**: Absent. No references to historical suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: Present. The user is actively engaged in the suicidal process (e.g., ""I currently weigh 90 pounds,"" setting a ""new goal weight""), indicating ongoing behavior.
- **Future ideation**: Present. The timeline is non-immediate but concrete (""slowly kill myself""), with a focus on gradual progression toward death. However, there is no specific imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").

**Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
- Start: No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
- Explicit suicide intent is present (""kill myself,"" ""I'm going to die"").
- This intent is paired with specific method (anorexia as a means to die) and preparation evidence (setting weight goals to achieve lethality).
- Therefore, decision tree path **b) applies: Explicit suicide intent + specific method/preparation → BEHAVIOR**.
- Not IDEATION because the presence of a specific method and preparation elevates it beyond mere desire.
- Not INDICATOR due to explicit suicidal intent without rejection.

### Final Classification: behavior

**Rationale Summary**: The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent with a specific method (self-starvation via anorexia) and active preparations (setting and adjusting weight goals to ensure death). While the timeline is gradual (""slowly""), the combination of intent, method specificity, and preparation meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR per the framework. Irreducible rules are followed: writer-focused (no external references), no higher category (e.g., no past attempt), no rejection to downgrade, and one output.",behavior,True

Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child.

Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all?

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""put down"" refer to animal euthanasia metaphorically applied to self.  
- **Indirect death references**: Metaphorical comparison to a sick dog being ""put down"" (applied to self).  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""can't do it anymore""), worthlessness (""abomination""), dissociation (""nothing's real"").  
- **Specific methods/preparations**: None.  
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts.  
- **Relevant negatives**: No ownership of suicidal intent (""I want to die""), no timelines (""tonight""), no method details.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Absent. Desires focus on *wanting trauma/illness* (""why do I want horrible things to happen to me?"") or intrusive violent thoughts, not self-harm.  
- **Passive experience**: Intrusive thoughts dominate (""my brain forces me to think I have it"").  
- **Rejection noted**: Implicit distancing via metaphor (comparing self to a dog needing euthanasia).  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Past**: Trauma speculation (""may have happened before"") but no suicide-related actions.  
- **Present**: Distress and hopelessness, but no active suicidal planning.  
- **Future**: Non-specific metaphor (""eventually it'll get sick enough""), no concrete timeline.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""the thought of suicide"", ""plotting my suicide"", ""suicide pact with yourself"", and implied references like ""do 'it'"" (in context of suicide).
- **Indirect death references**: ""back off the proverbial cliff"" (metaphorical), ""demise"" (referring to death), but these are framed as avoided or hypothetical.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""I just can't 'click' into life""), worthlessness (""I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak""), and unbearable pain (""torment of thoughts"", ""horrid hole of thoughts"", ""lingering emotional aftermath"").
- **Specific methods**: None detailed; writer explicitly rejects methods like household weapons (""I would never use a weapon from my household"").
- **Preparations**: ""drafted my will"" (a preparatory action) and ""plotting my suicide seriously on and off for months"" (indicates planning, but no specifics on method or location).
- **Past actions**: No description of actual self-harm or suicide attempt. Mentions of ""plotting"" and drafting a will are preparatory but not actions toward imminent self-harm. Writer states ""I wasn't scared"" after drafting will, but this is not an attempt.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Writer expresses ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I have been plotting my suicide""), but this is consistently paired with rejection or ambivalence.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are described as intrusive or obligatory (""suicide feel like an obligation""), yet writer actively disavows acting on them.
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present: ""I don't think I would do 'it'"", ""please don't worry"", and ""I am out of my hole for now"". Writer also emphasizes not wanting to scare others and being in counseling, reinforcing rejection of action.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: ""Plotting"" occurred ""on and off for months"", and drafting will happened ""yesterday"". Writer describes recurring slumps but no past attempts.
- **Present intent**: No current plan or intent; writer states ""Today, I feel better"" and ""I am out of my hole for now"", indicating relief from active crisis.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing (""on and off for months""), but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). Ideation is presented as manageable and rejected in the present.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. The post describes preparatory actions (drafting will) and plotting, but no actual self-harm with suicidal intent (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language). → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/prep or immediacy)?** Explicit suicidal desire is present (""plotting my suicide""), and there is preparation evidence (drafting will). However, there is no specific method, no immediate timeline (writer rejects current action and feels ""better"" today), and explicit rejection (""I don't think I would do 'it'"") downgrades this. Irreducible Rule 4 (rejection → indicator) applies. → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** Suicidal desire is explicit, but preparation (drafting will) and Rule 4 rejection prevent this from being pure ideation. Writer's disavowal and lack of actionable plan shift this away from IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The core of the post is distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphors (""back off the proverbial cliff""), and rejected/intrusive thoughts (""I don't think I would do 'it'""). No expressions of active, actionable suicidal desire in the present context. Clarification: ""I drafted my will"" is preparation, but with rejection and no immediacy, it is insufficient for BEHAVIOR and falls under general distress/indicator. → INDICATOR.

**Final Classification Rationale**: 
- The writer expresses suicidal ideation but explicitly rejects acting on it, downgrading to INDICATOR per Rule 4. 
- Preparatory actions (drafting will) are historical and not tied to current intent or immediacy. 
- Emotional distress and metaphors dominate, with no evidence of imminent risk or past attempt. 
- Temporal hierarchy (Rule 2) and rejection rule (Rule 4) support INDICATOR as the single category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: None. Phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are absent.
   - Indirect death references: None. No mentions of ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die.""
   - Emotional markers: Present, including hopelessness (""i have no one""), worthlessness (""i feel like he would be better off without me""), and distress (""i am so sick of this,"" ""i get abused enough at home""). However, these are contextualized within relationship struggles and criticism, not suicide.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., pills, firearms).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Past actions: No references to suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: No expressions of suicidal ownership (e.g., ""I want to die""). The post focuses on frustration with interpersonal conflicts and emotional pain.
   - Passive experience: No descriptions of intrusive suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal of suicide because suicidal intent is not present. The closest is ""i want it to stop,"" which refers to ending criticism/abuse, not life.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Describes historical events (e.g., Z mocking the writer ""today,"" past conversations about anxiety).
   - Present intent: No current suicidal plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Future ideation: No non-specific suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""someday"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) Past suicide attempt? No → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy? No explicit suicide intent → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No explicit desire to die (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.
   - d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post shows general distress (e.g., depression, hopelessness), metaphorical expressions of escape (""i want it to stop"" implies ending emotional pain, not life), and no suicidal content. Falls under INDICATOR.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: The post contains distress (unhappiness, hopelessness, despair) and relational metaphors (e.g., ""if i leave them i have no one"" conveys isolation), but no actionable suicide intent. Emotional markers are present but not linked to suicide. Clarification: Phrases like ""i want it to stop"" are metaphorical and lack suicide context.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
1. Writer-focused: Mentions of others (Z, ex) are ignored; focus is on the writer's distress.
2. Temporal hierarchy: Not triggered (no higher-level categories present).
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") related to suicide.
4. Rejection downgrade: Not applicable (suicide not introduced).
5. Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is the best fit.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I don't want to kill myself"" (explicit rejection).  
- **Indirect death references**: None (phrases like ""walls closing in"" imply distress, not death).  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""nothing is going to change""), worthlessness (""nothing going for me""), stagnation, isolation.  
- **Methods/preparations**: None mentioned.  
- **Past actions**: No suicide attempts described.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: Explicitly rejected (""I don’t want to kill myself"").  
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described.  
- **Rejection noted**: Clear disavowal (""I don’t want to kill myself"") and active desire to live (""I want to give life a chance"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- Focuses on chronic distress (2-year unemployment, ongoing stagnation) with no immediate or future suicidal timeline.

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself"".
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"").
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Life just gets more and more overwhelming and difficult"", ""I can't get myself to do anything anymore"", ""I'm just in a rut with a very small support system"") and worthlessness (""too weak and pathetic"").
   - Specific methods: No mention of any method (e.g., pills, firearms).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations). The phrase ""I probably will hit up everyone I have in my contacts and try and go out"" suggests social outreach or distraction, not suicide preparation.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I want to die tomorrow"", ""I want to kill myself""), indicating personal desire.
   - Passive experience: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" framing).
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal is present (""but I know I shouldn't"") and incapacity is stated (""I just am too weak and pathetic to do it""), which negates active intent to act.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No references to past actions or attempts.
   - Present intent: Suicidal thoughts are expressed in the present, but no immediate plan or timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: Specific near-future desire (""I want to die tomorrow"") is stated, but it is coupled with rejection and no actionable steps.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent is present, but there is no specific method/preparation, and the timeline (""tomorrow"") is not ""immediate"" per framework definitions (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"" would be required for BEHAVIOR). Additionally, explicit rejection (""I know I shouldn't"") disqualifies this from BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire exists, but it is not classified as IDEATION due to the rejection and disavowal, which triggers a downgrade per Rule 4.
   - d) The core elements are distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) and rejected suicidal thoughts (""I want to kill myself... but I know I shouldn't"" and ""too weak... to do it""), fitting INDICATOR. The phrase ""How to deal with suicidal thoughts and ideations"" further emphasizes distress without actionable intent.
   - Irreducible Rule 4 (""Rejection downgrade"") applies, overriding the desire and placing this in INDICATOR.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - **Explicit suicide references**: ""yeet myself"" (colloquial for self-harm/suicide).
   - **Indirect death references**: ""dead inside"", ""beyond saving"".
   - **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""how useless life is""), worthlessness (""beyond saving""), anhedonia (""still anhedonic"").
   - **Methods/preparations**: None specified (""yeet"" is vague slang, no actionable details).
   - **Past actions**: None described.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active ownership: ""I just want to... yeet myself"" expresses personal desire.
   - No disavowal: Absence of rejection (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Present/future focus: Describes ongoing despair (""still sad"") and non-specific desire (""want to yeet myself""), no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.
   - Explicit desire (""yeet myself"") but lacks method specificity, preparation, or immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""yeet myself"") without plan/timeline → IDEATION.
   - Distress/hopelessness alone would be INDICATOR, but explicit suicide wish overrules this.

**Key Judgments**:
- ""Yeet myself"" is treated as explicit suicidal desire (similar to ""kill myself"").
- Emotional context supports hopelessness but doesn’t override active suicidal ideation.
- No downgrade due to absence of rejection language.

   - Methods/preparations: None specified.  
   - Past actions: None described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Thoughts are framed as **passive/intrusive** (""my brain is screaming at me to give up"") rather than actively endorsed.

   - Emotional markers: ""mortifying"", ""embarrassed"", ""nauseous"", ""dreading"", ""cannot stand living""  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts described (only *avoided* attempts)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Suicide is framed as a *rejected alternative* (""it was either that [moving home] or going through with attempting suicide"")  
   - No active endorsement of current intent; instead, suicide is presented as a past option that was avoided  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - All suicide references are in the *past*: ""was so close to attempting"" (historical crisis point)  
   - Present focus is on distress about moving home, not active suicidal planning  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - ❌ No past **attempt** described (only consideration/prevention)  
   - ❌ No explicit current intent + method/preparation/immediacy → **behavior**  
   - ❌ No active suicidal desire in present → **ideation**

   - Methods/preparations: None described (e.g., no pills, weapons, or plans).  
   - Past actions: No mention of prior attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit rejection: ""wont kill myself of course"" actively disavows suicidal action.  
   - Suicidal phrasing (""kill myself"") is framed as an intrusive thought, not endorsed.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None present. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
- **Indirect death references**: None. Phrases like ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die"" are absent.
- **Emotional markers**: Distress is evident (e.g., ""obsessing over appearance,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria,"" ""I hate""), but no explicit hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain tied to suicide or death.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, hanging, jumping, firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes, scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: None reported (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of self-harm).

### Step 2: Intent Analysis (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or similar expressions). The desire stated (""I want to be a male now"") relates to gender identity, not suicide.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" about self-harm).
- **Rejection noted**: No suicidal thoughts to reject or disavow, as the content lacks suicide-related elements.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to historical suicide attempts or self-harm.
- **Present intent**: No current suicide plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""I want to be a male now"" indicates a present desire for transition, not self-harm.
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific or specific suicidal thoughts or timing (e.g., ""someday"" about dying).

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent, method, preparation, or immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., no ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live"") → Not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post contains distress (gender dysphoria, unhappiness with appearance) but no actionable suicide intent. Metaphorical death references (e.g., ""want to disappear"") or rejected suicidal thoughts are absent, but general despair is present without suicide context. Per category definitions, this fits INDICATOR.

   - Emotional markers: ""hate myself,"" ""loathe my existence,"" despair/hopelessness  
   - **Absent**: Specific methods, preparations, past attempts, or timelines.  
   - **Key rejection**: Contrasts suicidal wish with active desire to endure (""I just want the courage to endure"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Suicidal thought is framed as a *wish* (""wish I had the courage""), not an active intent.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""almost committed suicide""
   - Preparation evidence: ""didn't have anything to do it with"" (implies method consideration)
   - Temporal marker: ""a few days ago"" (past-focused)
   - Emotional markers: severe anxiety, family conflict, isolation (""spend birthday alone"")
   - Ongoing ideation: ""yet I still consider""
   - No active preparation/timeline for future attempt

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Ownership of past intent: ""I almost committed suicide"" (active endorsement)
   - No rejection of current thoughts: ""still consider"" implies passive persistence

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Primary focus: Past event (""a few days ago"")
   - Secondary: Non-specific ongoing ideation (""still consider"")
   - No imminent timeline (birthday mention is contextual, not suicide-related)

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   → ""Almost committed suicide"" qualifies as **aborted/interrupted attempt** (per rules: ""interrupted/aborted attempts count as ATTEMPT"").

   - Explicit suicide references: The post contains multiple explicit uses of ""suicide"" (e.g., ""suicide with me,"" ""can anyone suicide with me together,"" ""want to suicide too""), indicating direct references to the act.
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: No expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain; the focus is on the act itself and recruitment.
   - Specific methods: No mention of any method (e.g., pills, firearms).
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The invitation to join (""suicide with me together"") implies a desire for collective action but does not constitute concrete preparation as defined.
   - Past actions: No references to past attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts through direct invitations like ""suicide with me,"" indicating personal intent to act.
   - Passive experience: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or unwanted (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); the language is proactive and endorsing.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
   - Past focus: Absent; no historical descriptions.
   - Present intent: The phrasing ""suicide with me"" and ""together"" suggests a current willingness to act, but there is no explicit imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Future ideation: The non-specific timing (e.g., no date or time) leans toward general desire rather than immediate action.

   - b) Explicit suicide intent is present (""suicide with me""), but no specific method, preparation evidence, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""want to suicide"") without actionable plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
   - d) Not applicable, as the post contains explicit suicide desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION:**
- Writer-focused: Analysis centers on the writer's intent (e.g., ""suicide with me""), ignoring potential references to others.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt described, and no immediacy to override IDEATION.
- Immediacy trumps: Absence of ""tonight"" or similar keeps this in IDEATION.
- Rejection downgrade: No disavowal, so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
- Output exactly one category: IDEATION is selected.

166,"I want to kms but nothing is ready and I'm scared for some reason. Hello. I just got home from work and I really want to hang myself right now. I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""want to kms"", ""hang myself"", ""kill myself""  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself""  
   - Preparation: ""put the rope around my neck"", ""practice hung""  
   - Past action: ""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two""  
   - Emotional markers: ""I am a burden,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself,"" ""I don't feel like I can wait""  
   - Immediacy: ""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I really want to hang myself right now,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself.""  
   - Rejection noted? Hesitation due to fear of failure/preparation (""nothing is ready""), but no disavowal of desire.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past**: Describes practicing hanging (aborted action).  
   - **Present**: Urgent desire (""right now,"" ""can't wait"").  
   - **Future**: References ideal prep (""when I kill myself... packed apartment""), but current intent dominates.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - **a)** Past suicide attempt described → **YES** (""put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung"").  
     → **ATTEMPT** (irreducible rule #2: Attempt overrules other categories).  
   - *Stop here*: Attempt classification supersedes concurrent ideation/behavior.  

</thinking>  
Final Classification: **attempt**  

**Key Justification**:  
- The phrase ""practice hung"" + physical action (rope around neck) constitutes an aborted suicide attempt per framework rules (""interrupted/aborted attempts qualify"").  
- Temporal hierarchy (rule #2) mandates prioritizing this over present ideation (""want to hang myself right now"") or preparation.  
- Fear of failure (""afraid of failing"") does not negate the attempt classification, as the action was initiated.",ideation,True
167,"I'm finally doing it. I think I'm finally going to actually do it. I've been sobbing for the last few hours. I think I'm finally ready to do it. I finally got confirmation that my fiancé doesn't really care. It's finally fucking time. I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it, but I've always thought I was going to get a gun. I don't know though, but I think I know that I'm going to go through with it. This job has been making me violently suicidal. We need the money or we won't survive though, but I'm so fucking overwhelmed. I'm done being told how terrible of a person I am and how I'm ruining people's lives every other call I take. I'm done not knowing what to do or how to do my job. I'm a fucking failure and I'll die a failure but at least I'll be dead.

I've pushed my fiancé away I guess if he didn't even bother to do this for me, to care that I haven't stopped crying. I just want to fucking die. I don't want to be here any more.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains multiple direct statements, such as ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I'm finally ready to do it,"" ""This job has been making me violently suicidal,"" ""I told him this job was making me suicidal,"" and ""I just want to fucking die."" These indicate clear suicidal intent.
   - **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""I'll finally be at peace"" and ""at least I'll be dead"" imply death as relief, but they are contextualized within explicit suicidal intent.
   - **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm a fucking failure,"" ""I'll die a failure""), worthlessness (""I'm ruining people's lives,"" ""I didn't want to be a bigger fucking burden""), and unbearable pain (""sobbing for the last few hours,"" ""couldn't stop crying, I couldn't breathe,"" ""so fucking overwhelmed"") are pervasive.
   - **Specific methods**: The user mentions ""I've always thought I was going to get a gun,"" but qualifies this with uncertainty: ""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it."" This suggests a method is considered but not specified, planned, or acted upon for the current intent.
   - **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means (e.g., no mention of obtaining a gun), writing suicide notes, or scouting locations. The statement ""I'm finally ready"" reflects mental preparation but not tangible actions. Sharing feelings (""I told him today"") is emotional disclosure, not a preparatory step.
   - **Past actions**: References to ""my suicidal ideation"" and historical distress (e.g., job-related struggles) are noted, but no description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. The phrase ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" is absent.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Active endorsement**: The writer consistently claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I"" statements (e.g., ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I want to fucking die""),",ideation,True
168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""end things"" (common euphemism for suicide).  
   - Preparation evidence: ""driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things"" (concrete action toward suicide).  
   - Emotional markers: Isolation (""people in my life apathetic""), hopelessness (""be numb""), passive death wish (""sleep and sleep"").  
   - Rejection noted: ""I don’t think I’m going to do it"" (explicit disavowal).  
   - No past attempt described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active ownership: Claims personal intent (""*I* just finished driving... with full intentions"").  
   - Clear rejection: ""It was impulsive and I don’t think I’m going to do it"" downgrades active intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past preparation: ""just finished driving"" (immediate past action).  
   - No current/imminent timeline (rejected future action).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - Preparation + explicit intent → Initially aligns with **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - **BUT** explicit rejection (""I don’t think I’m going to do it"") triggers Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade).  
   - Downgraded to **INDICATOR**: Prep was impulsive and actively disavowed; focus shifts to distress/metaphors (""sleep to be numb"").  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
   - Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade) overrides preparatory action.  
   - Temporal hierarchy not triggered (no concurrent intent).

169,"I'm ready to die :). The date was set a while ago. I even changed it, but nothing in my life is changing at the projection for a fulfilling life. I'm ready. Preps being made for me to go out the way I want. I'm strapped in and ready to go. Fuck this world.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""go out"" (likely euphemism for suicide) indicate a direct desire for death.
- **Indirect death references**: ""The date was set"" and ""changed it"" imply a planned death timeline; ""go out the way I want"" suggests a controlled exit.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing,"" ""no projection for a fulfilling life"") and rejection of life (""Fuck this world"").
- **Specific methods**: Not explicitly stated (e.g., no mention of pills, firearms, etc.). ""Strapped in and ready to go"" is ambiguous—could be metaphorical for readiness or imply a method (e.g., vehicular or other means), but it lacks specificity.
- **Preparations**: Clear evidence with ""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"" and ""the date was set a while ago... I even changed it,"" indicating active planning and adjustment of suicide plans.
- **Past actions**: No description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). References to setting/changing a date are preparatory, not actionable.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership with direct statements like ""I'm ready to die"" and ""I'm strapped in and ready to go,"" showing personal commitment to suicidal thoughts.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" framing); thoughts are presented as deliberate.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The tone is resolute and affirmative.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: References to setting and changing a date are historical planning but not an attempt.
- **Present intent**: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Preps being made"" indicate current state and ongoing preparations. ""I'm strapped in and ready to go"" conveys immediacy (like ""ready now""), though not explicitly timed (e.g., ""tonight"").
- **Future ideation**: ""The date was set"" implies a future timeline, but the emphasis on current readiness (""ready to go"") overshadows this, leaning toward imminent action.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past attempt described?** No, only planning/preparations mentioned, not an actual attempt. → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** 
    - Explicit intent: Yes (""ready to die"").
    - Preparation evidence: Yes (""Preps being made"").
    - Specific method: Not stated (vague references like ""go out the way I want"" and ""strapped in"" are insufficient).
    - Immediate timeline: ""Ready to go"" expresses immediate intent (similar to ""now"" or ""tonight"" per critical expansion rule), though not perfectly specific.
    - Since preparation is present and intent is explicit, this qualifies for BEHAVIOR. Immediacy (""ready to go"") reinforces this.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as preparations and immediacy are present.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to explicit intent and preparations.

### Category Alignment with Definitions and Rules
- **Behavior** fits: The post shows explicit suicidal intent (""ready to die"") paired with preparation evidence (""Preps being made""). Per critical expansion, expressions of immediate intent (""ready to go"") qualify even without method details. The presence of preparations demonstrates capability.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  - Writer-focused: All content is self-referential.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt mentioned, so behavior takes precedence over ideation.
  - Immediacy trumps: ""Ready to go"" indicates urgency, overriding non-specific elements.
  - Rejection downgrade: No rejection; intent is affirmed.
  - Output one category: Behavior is the clearest fit.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""Im thinking of ending my life"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: Strong themes of hopelessness (""I don't have much choices either""), worthlessness (e.g., friends ditching, academic failures), and distress (depression, panic attacks, OCD, social isolation). However, these are contextual and not standalone suicide indicators.
   - Specific methods: No mention of pills, hanging, etc.; ""ending my life"" is vague and non-specific.
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: Describes historical struggles (e.g., OCD, depression, school issues) but no references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The statement ""Im thinking of ending my life"" is presented as a personal, owned thought (""I""), indicating active suicidal desire.
   - Passive experience: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Dominates the post (e.g., academic history, OCD development), but suicide reference is in present tense (""thinking of"").
   - Present intent: Suicidal thought is current but lacks specificity (no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or immediate timeline).
   - Future ideation: No future-oriented timing (e.g., ""someday""); the thought is framed as ongoing but not imminent.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) Past attempt? No mention of any suicide attempt → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy? Explicit intent (""ending my life"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes: ""thinking of ending my life"" expresses active desire, but no actionable plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
   - d) Only distress/rejected thoughts? No, because explicit suicidal desire is present → Not INDICATOR.

**Key Clarifications from Definitions**:
- IDEATION is defined as ""active suicidal desire without actionable plan,"" which fits the vague ""ending my life"" without method or timeline.
- BEHAVIOR requires immediacy or specificity (e.g., ""tonight"" or method details), absent here.
- INDICATOR is ruled out due to explicit suicidal desire.
- ATTEMPT is not applicable, as no past actions are described.

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:
1. Writer-focused: Analysis only considers the author's experiences (no external references).
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so hierarchy doesn't override.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy, so IDEATION stands.
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection of thoughts, so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. One output: IDEATION is the clear category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (no ""suicide"", ""kill myself"", etc.).  
   - Indirect death references: ""pls let me never wake up"" (passive death wish).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness implied in ""hopefully this is my last post"".  
   - Methods/preparations/past actions: None identified.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Ownership: Implied desire for death (""never wake up""), but phrased passively (""let me"").  
   - Rejection: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future-oriented: ""never wake up"" suggests anticipation of death (non-specific timing).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) No explicit intent (e.g., ""I will die"") + no method/preparation/immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) Indirect death wish without plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION? **No**: IDEATION requires explicit desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - d) Indirect reference (""never wake up"") + hopelessness → INDICATOR (distress without actionable intent).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""Never wake up"" is metaphorical and lacks explicit suicidal ownership or immediacy.  
- Falls under INDICATOR per framework: ""metaphorical death references"" without active suicidal desire.

- **Preparations**: Acquired means (""i have 42 unnamed pills""), noted ease of swallowing

- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""antidepressants [...] obviously didnt work""), dissociation (""im really out of it"")  
- **No past attempt described**: Only references *unfulfilled* prior threats (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"")  
- **No rejection**: No disavowal of intent (e.g., ""but I won’t"" is absent).  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**

   - **No preparations** described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes)
   - **No past actions** (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"")
   - Context: Framed as a recurring thought (""more and more often"") and concludes with catharsis (""feels good to get all of this off my chest"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Ownership of thought: ""I want to"" in ""kill myself"" shows active endorsement.
   - **No rejection or disavowal**: Absence of phrases like ""but I won’t do it"" or ""I don’t actually want to.""
   - Desire is contextualized as hypothetical (""the only way I could... would be"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

   - ✅ Explicit suicidal desire (""want to check out"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**  
   - ❌ Not applicable (no rejection or metaphors-only)  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""Check out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide with active personal ownership.  
- ""Spite"" as a barrier doesn’t negate desire (contrast with: ""I want to die *but won’t*"").

Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""commit suicide"", ""end it with pills"", ""result in suicide"".  
   - Indirect death references: ""Life over"", ""that's it"".  
   - Emotional markers: None expressing personal hopelessness/worthlessness (focuses on factual consequences).  
   - Specific methods: Detailed discussion of overdose (""take the pills"", ""overdosing"").  
   - Preparations: None described as personal actions.  
   - Past actions: None claimed by the writer.  
   - *Key observation*: All content is **informational/general**, not autobiographical. Phrases like ""you could"" and ""Don't take..."" show external focus.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **No active endorsement** of personal suicidal thoughts. Uses second-person (""you"") throughout.  
   - **Explicit rejection**: ""Don't take the pills"" (repeated), ""not worth it"", ""do NOT result in suicide"" (discouraging action).  
   - Writer distances self from intent: ""I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide"" frames this as advice, not confession.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - No past/present/future personal timeline. Describes hypothetical/clinical scenarios (""you'll become jaundiced"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) **No past attempt** described → not *attempt*.  
   - b) **No personal intent** → rules out *behavior*.  
   - c) **No expressions of personal desire** → rules out *ideation*.  
   - d) **Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts**:  
     - Focuses on risks of suicide methods (educational).  
     - Strong discouragement (""Don't take the pills"").  
     - No first-person suicidal ideation → **INDICATOR**.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:  
- Writer-focused: Ignores second-person references (e.g., ""you"").  
- Rejection downgrade: Explicit warnings align with *indicator*.  
- Temporal/immediacy: Absent personal context.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
- Explicit suicide references: ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it"" imply suicide, as ""do it"" refers to ending life based on context like ""no motivation to keep on living.""
- Indirect death references: None; phrases like ""be gone"" or ""not wake up"" are absent.
- Emotional markers: Hopelessness is present (""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""fed up of this"").
- Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., pills, firearms).
- Preparations: None described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- Past actions: No references to past attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**
- Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it,"" indicating active desire.
- Passive experience: Thoughts are not presented as intrusive or unwanted; the writer expresses personal intent.
- Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal of immediate action with ""im not ready,"" ""dont worry, im good rn,"" and ""i dont want my family to be sad,"" but this does not reject the future desire itself.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
- Past focus: No suicide attempts; mental health issues are historical but not suicide-related actions.
- Present intent: No immediacy; ""im not ready"" and ""im good rn"" indicate no current plans.
- Future ideation: Clear non-specific future intent with ""gonna do it in the future"" and ""ill do it when im fed up.""

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
- a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit suicide intent (""im positive im gonna do it"") but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (""in the future,"" not ""tonight"" or ""now"") → Not BEHAVIOR.
- c) Explicit suicide desire (""no motivation to keep on living,"" ""gonna do it"") without plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
- d) Distress is present, but active suicidal desire exists; not ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Not INDICATOR.

**Key Rule Applications:**
- Writer-focused: Only the user's own thoughts are considered.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior, so ideation is possible.
- Immediacy: ""in the future"" lacks immediacy, so no upgrade to behavior.
- Rejection downgrade: Partial disavowal (""im not ready,"" ""im good rn"") but does not negate active future desire (e.g., no ""I don't actually want to""), so no downgrade to indicator.
- Output one category: IDEATION is the best fit due to explicit desire without actionable plan or immediacy.

- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die"" missing)  
- **Passive experience**: No description of intrusive suicidal thoughts  
- **Rejection noted**: N/A (suicide not referenced)  
*→ Core focus: Distress about existence/neglect, NOT suicidal intent*  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Past**: Criticism of parents’ past actions (""having me"")  
- **Present**: Description of current suffering (""living a life psychologically tortured"")  
- **Future**: No implied timeline for self-harm

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. The post describes a dream about mass murder by others (e.g., ""mass murdering people,"" ""slicing up as many people""), but no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"" are used. The violence is external and not self-directed.
- **Indirect death references**: Death is referenced in the context of the dream (e.g., ""mass murdering,"" ""slicing up people""), but these are about others dying, not the writer. No phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"" apply to the writer.
- **Emotional markers**: Distress is evident (e.g., ""severe panic attack,"" ""absolutely terrified,"" ""sheer panic,"" ""anxious to sleep""), but no hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain related to the writer's own life or existence. The emotions are tied to fear from the dream and its aftermath.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or self-harm. The violence described is perpetrated by others in the dream.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of suicide planning (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The writer focuses on coping with the dream, not preparing for self-harm.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted""). The post recounts a dream and waking reaction, not real-life suicidal behavior.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses fear about the dream but does not state any personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"").
- **Passive experience**: The dream could be interpreted as intrusive, but it is explicitly framed as a nightmare, not an intrusive thought experienced while awake (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" regarding self-harm).
- **Rejection noted**: No suicidal thoughts are presented to reject. The writer seeks understanding and coping strategies (e.g., ""how to deal with it""), implying a desire to reduce distress, not to act on self-harm.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: The dream and panic attack are described as past events (e.g., ""dreamt,"" ""woke up,"" ""jolted awake""). No past suicidal actions are mentioned.
- **Present intent**: No current suicidal plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"" related to self-harm). The writer's focus is on current anxiety about sleeping.
- **Future ideation**: No expressions of future suicidal thoughts or ideation (e.g., no ""someday I might"" related to dying).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post describes a dream, not a real suicide attempt.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** → No explicit suicide intent, no methods, no preparations, no immediacy.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die or suicidal desire.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post shows distress (panic, terror) and metaphorical death references (in the dream context), but these are not actionable or self-directed. There are no suicidal thoughts to reject, but the content fits the broader ""indicator"" category due to general distress without suicidal intent.

### Category Alignment
- **Indicator**: Matches perfectly. The post contains general distress (panic attacks, anxiety about sleep) and metaphorical death references (the dream's violence), but no expressions of active suicidal desire, plan, or intent. The writer seeks help to ""deal with"" the dreams, reinforcing a focus on coping rather than self-harm. Per the clarification, metaphorical death references without suicidal context fall under indicator.

### Irreducible Rules Validation
1. **Writer-focused**: Ignored mentions of others' actions (the dream attackers). Focused solely on the writer's experiences—distress from the dream, no self-harm.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Not triggered (no attempt, behavior, or ideation present).
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy related to suicide.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable (no suicidal thoughts to downgrade).
5. **Output exactly one**: Indicator is the only applicable category.

Final classification is **indicator**.

181,what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it. i don't want to believe theres nothing. ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose. all i saw was fear and despair. please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""end this suffering"" (implies seeking suicide as relief).  
   - Emotional markers: ""despair,"" ""suffering,"" hopelessness implied in needing ""something to believe in.""  
   - **Critical past action**: ""ive overdosed twice... once on purpose"" (explicit past suicide attempt).  
   - Preparations/intent: ""give me the strength... to end this suffering"" indicates active desire but no specific current plan/method.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Past attempt (""on purpose"") shows active endorsement of suicidal behavior historically.  
   - Current language (""need something to believe in so I can do it"") suggests unresolved ideation but lacks *immediate* intent declaration (e.g., ""tonight"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - **Past**: Clear description of suicide attempt (""overdosed... on purpose"").  
   - Present/Future: Non-specific timing (""so I can do it"" – no ""now"" or ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - Start → **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → YES (""overdosed... on purpose"").  
   → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
   - *Rule 2 (Temporal Hierarchy)*: Attempt overrides concurrent ideation (""end this suffering"").  

</thinking>
Final Classification: **attempt**  

**Reasoning Closure**:  
- The phrase ""overdosed twice... once on purpose"" is an unambiguous past suicide attempt, triggering the **ATTEMPT** category per irreducible rules (Attempt > Behavior/Ideation). Current distress (""end this suffering"") doesn't downgrade this, as disclosed attempts override concurrent ideation.",ideation,True
182,I thought I was getting better. for the past few weeks I've been happy just to be spending time with my partner without any bad days. I thought I was finally getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again. I've run out of meds and I asked for an urgent refill a few days ago but my doctors/pharmacy never got back to me. I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal again"" (directly states a suicidal state).  
   - Indirect death references: None (no phrases like ""be gone"" or ""not wake up"").  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I thought I was getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again""), worthlessness (""hurting my significant other""), and distress (running out of meds, fear of stressing partner).  
   - Specific methods: None mentioned.  
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no note-writing or means acquisition).  
   - Past actions: None (mentions historical improvement but no description of past attempts).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I'm suicidal again"" expresses ownership of suicidal thoughts but lacks explicit active desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts framed separately from self (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").  
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). Concern for partner implies ambivalence but not rejection of thoughts.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: References prior happiness and medication issues (""a few days ago""), but suicidal ideation is current (""all of a sudden I'm suicidal again"").  
   - Present intent: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), method, or preparation.  
   - Future ideation: Non-specific (no timeframe for acting on thoughts).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - b) No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die"") paired with method/preparation/immediacy → Not **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) ""Suicidal again"" implies desire but lacks specificity: No plan, preparation, or timeline → Not **IDEATION** (requires explicit wish like ""want to die"").  
   - d) Distress (hopelessness, medication lapse) with suicidal metaphor/generalization → **INDICATOR**.  

**Key Rationale**:  
- ""Suicidal again"" is a generalized distress marker, not an explicit active wish to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"").  
- No plan, method, timeline, or preparation.  
- Falls under INDICATOR per rules: ""General despair without actionable suicide intent"" and ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"".  
- Temporal hierarchy and rejection rules do not override (no attempt/behavior and no disavowal).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I want to die more than ever.""  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I'll never come back""), worthlessness (""she thinks I'm worthless""), unbearable pain (""I can't have this life it's too painful,"" ""It's just too hard"").  
   - **No** indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I want to die more than ever"" claims ownership of desire.  
   - **No rejection** (e.g., no disavowal like ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present-focused desire (""now I want to die""), but **no imminent timeline** (e.g., ""tonight"") or future specificity.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicide by hanging"" directly states the method and intent.
   - Indirect death references: None; the query is specific to suicide.
   - Emotional markers: Uncertainty (""im still not sure"") is present, but no explicit hopelessness or worthlessness.
   - Specific methods: ""Hanging"" is clearly identified as the method.
   - Preparations: ""ive alr tied the noose"" confirms concrete preparation (tying a noose is evidence of capability).
   - Past actions: No description of a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" regarding self-harm); ""tied the noose"" is preparatory, not an attempt.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership (""suicide by hanging,"" ""ive alr tied the noose""), indicating personal involvement in suicidal thoughts.
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the language is direct and self-referential.
   - Rejection noted?: ""im still not sure"" expresses ambivalence but not explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""I won't do it""). This is hesitation, not rejection, so it doesn't downgrade the risk.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Preparation (""tied the noose"") occurred in the past.
   - Present intent: The query about the experience (""Is suicide by hanging..."") and the completed preparation suggest current, active consideration.
   - Future ideation: No specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but preparation implies imminence.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start → a) No past suicide attempt described (""tied the noose"" is preparation, not an attempt).  
     → b) Explicit suicide intent (""suicide by hanging"") + (specific method/preparation: method ""hanging"" and preparation ""tied the noose"") → **BEHAVIOR**.

185,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""kill myself"" and ""want to die"" are direct mentions of suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress, worthlessness (""I'm a pervert""), and hopelessness (""I can't help my sexual feelings"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no details like pills or firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting).
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I want to die"" and poses a direct question about action (""Should I kill myself?""), indicating active consideration.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., not framed as ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"" or similar rejection). The question ""Should I kill myself?"" implies ambivalence but not rejection, and the statement ""I want to die"" reinforces active desire.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No descriptions of past suicide-related actions (only general statements about feelings).
- **Present intent**: Suicidal desire is expressed in the present (""I want to die""), but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") is specified.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing; the question ""Should I kill myself?"" suggests future consideration without concrete plans.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit intent (""I want to die"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes, ""I want to die"" is explicit desire, with no actionable plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No, because explicit suicidal desire is present, and there is no rejection.

**Category Alignment**: IDEATION fits best, as the post shows active suicidal desire without evidence of a specific plan, preparation, or imminent timeline. The emotional distress and worthlessness support this but do not override the explicit desire.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/thoughts are considered (no mentions of others).
2. Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt (rules out ATTEMPT), no immediacy (rules out BEHAVIOR).
3. Immediacy trumps: No terms like ""tonight"" present.
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection (""I don't actually want to"") noted; desire is affirmed.
5. One output: IDEATION is the clear category.

- Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""My life has been getting worse,"" ""I'm so lonely I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life,"" ""I miss being happy""), worthlessness implied by self-blame for life problems, and unbearable emotional pain.
- Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, hanging, etc.).
- Preparations: No evidence (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations). Being ""drunk in my basement"" describes current state, not preparation.
- Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language). References to life struggles (addiction, isolation) are contextual but not suicidal actions.

**Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS**
- Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership with ""I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" – this is a direct, first-person statement of intent, not passive.
- Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" framing).
- Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The closing ""I love you all so much 💛"" could imply farewell but does not reject the suicidal intent.

**Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
- Past focus: Describes historical issues (e.g., addiction, mistakes leading to isolation), but no past suicidal behavior.
- Present intent: ""tonight"" specifies an immediate timeline for suicidal action (""tonight I'm just gonna... end it"").
- Future ideation: No non-specific timing (e.g., ""someday""); the plan is concretely tied to the present/near future.

**Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
- a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit suicide intent (""end it"") + immediate timeline (""tonight"") → Qualifies for BEHAVIOR per rules (immediacy trumps, and ""expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details"").
- c) Not IDEATION due to presence of immediacy (""tonight"").
- d) Not INDICATOR because there is explicit, active suicidal desire without rejection.
- Irreducible rules applied: Writer-focused (all content is self-referential), temporal hierarchy (no attempt, so behavior overrides), immediacy (""tonight"" confirms behavior), no rejection to downgrade.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""end my life""  
- **Specific methods**: Pills (800mg codeine + ibuprofen)  
- **Preparations**: Possession of means (""I have 800mg codeine and access to ibuprofen"")  
- *No past actions, emotional markers, or rejection noted*  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Ownership of intent (""Will I be able to... end my life?"")  
- **No rejection**: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"")  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Present intent**: Inquiry implies active consideration (""Will I be able to...?""), suggesting immediacy.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **Step b)**: Explicit suicide intent (""end my life"") + specific method (codeine/ibuprofen) + preparation (possession) → **BEHAVIOR**  
- *Rules applied*:  
  - Preparation (having pills) qualifies as capability.  
  - Immediacy inferred from feasibility question.  
  - No past attempt mentioned → does not trigger ""ATTEMPT"".

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""resisting the desire to **end**"" (synonym for suicide), ""desire to end"".  
   - Emotional markers: ""failed everything"", ""wasted [life]"", ""not happy"", ""can't stand being here"", ""suffer everyday"", ""never been happy"".  
   - Preparations/actions: None described (e.g., no notes, method acquisition).  
   - Past actions: None (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Clear ownership (""**my** whole life resisting the desire to end"").  
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). Resistance implies struggle but not rejection.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future focus: ""can't live like this for the rest of my life"", ""can't stand being here any other moment"", ""can't imagine myself living another year"".  
   - No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) Explicit desire (""desire to end"") but **no** method/preparation/immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""desire to end"") + no plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.  
   - d) Distress/metaphors alone? No—active suicidal desire overrides general distress.  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Desire to end"" is an explicit suicidal wish (→ ideation/behavior).  
- Urgency (""can't stand being here any other moment"") lacks concrete timeline (e.g., ""now"") or method → insufficient for behavior.  
- Resistance ≠ rejection (Rule 4); writer still expresses active desire.  
- No temporal/immediacy terms (""tonight"") to trigger behavior.

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""commit suicide"" is a direct and explicit reference.
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"").
   - Emotional markers: No explicit hopelessness or worthlessness; the focus is on communication about suicide.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, firearms).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no acquiring means or writing notes).
   - Past actions: No references to past attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The phrase ""you will probably commit suicide eventually"" uses second-person phrasing but is self-referential (based on ""you"" meaning the writer). It claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I will probably commit suicide eventually"") without passive framing.
   - Passive experience: Not present; thoughts are stated as personal intent.
   - Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"" or similar rejection). The word ""probably"" implies likelihood but not ambivalence or refusal.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: None (no description of historical events).
   - Present intent: No immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: ""Eventually"" indicates non-specific future timing, fitting future ideation.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""will probably commit suicide"") is present, but no specific method/preparation or immediate timeline (""eventually"" is not imminent) → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan or immediacy → Fits IDEATION.
   - d) Not applicable, as there is explicit suicide desire (not solely distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts).

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Ideation**: The post expresses active suicidal desire (""will probably commit suicide"") with no actionable plan, method, or immediacy. ""Eventually"" confirms non-specific timing, and no rejection is present.
- **Indicator**: Does not apply, as there is explicit suicidal desire.
- **Behavior**: Does not apply, as there is no method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt**: Does not apply, as no past action is described.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Analysis ignores others; focuses solely on the writer's own statements.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No higher category (Attempt or Behavior) overrules.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediate timeline (""eventually"" is not imminent).

197,"so tempted to just go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground. if only such decisions were simple, if only there was no guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind or if i end up crippled instead of a corpse",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""plummet to the ground"" is a direct reference to suicide by jumping, implying a desire to die.
- **Indirect death references**: ""End up crippled instead of a corpse"" indirectly references death as a desired outcome.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness and despair are evident in ""if only such decisions were simple,"" and guilt/fear are expressed regarding the impact on others (""guilt or fear of what happens to those left behind"").
- **Specific methods**: ""Go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground"" specifies the method of jumping from a height.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The post describes a temptation, not active preparation.
- **Past actions**: No mention of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""so tempted to"" indicates personal ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I"" is implied), showing active consideration of suicide.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not presented as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Strong explicit disavowal is present. The writer expresses ambivalence due to guilt, fear of consequences, and fear of survival (""if only there was no guilt or fear...""), which directly counters the temptation and indicates the thought is not being acted upon.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: The temptation (""so tempted"") is current, but there is no indication of immediate action (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: The post implies a hypothetical scenario (""if only"") with non-specific timing, lacking any concrete plan or timeline.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No description of any past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit suicide intent is present (""so tempted to... plummet to the ground""), and a specific method (jumping) is mentioned.  
  - However, there is no evidence of preparation (e.g., acquiring means) or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
  - Crucially, the rejection (guilt/fear as barriers) downgrades this per Rule 4 (""Rejection downgrade"").  
  → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria due to disavowal and lack of immediacy/preparation.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**  
  - Explicit desire is expressed (""tempted to""), and a method is specified but is non-actionable due to the rejection and lack of plan.  
  - However, Rule 4 and the rejection element shift this toward INDICATOR.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**  
  - The core of the post is distress (hopelessness, guilt) and rejected thoughts. The suicidal temptation is explicitly countered by disavowal (""if only...""), making it non-actionable.  
  → Fits INDICATOR per category definition: ""Rejected/intrusive thoughts"" with ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"" after rejection.

**Final Decision**:  
- The post expresses suicidal temptation but firmly rejects action due to guilt and fear, aligning with INDICATOR (distress without actionable suicide intent).  
- Rule 4 (""Rejection downgrade"") applies, as the disavowal overrides the explicit desire.  
- Temporal hierarchy and irreducibility rules confirm INDICATOR is the appropriate category.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no ""not wake up"" or similar).
- **Emotional markers**: Implied relationship distress (""If I deeply hurt my boyfriend"") and potential guilt, but no explicit hopelessness/worthlessness (e.g., no ""life is unbearable"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of pills, hanging, or other methods.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting.
- **Past actions**: No references like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"".

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""if I kill myself"" claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (first-person ""I"" with direct action).
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The closing ""Any thoughts?"" seeks input but does not reject the idea.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No historical descriptions of actions.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). The conditional ""if"" suggests hypothetical future scenarios.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing implied (""if I deeply hurt my boyfriend"" – vague and not actionable).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) Past suicide attempt? No → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation/immediacy)? Explicit intent (""kill myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
  - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes: ""kill myself"" shows active desire, but no actionable plan or timeline → Matches IDEATION.
  - d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, because explicit suicide desire is present → Not INDICATOR.

### Category Definitions and Rules Check
- **Indicator**: Excluded because explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") is present, and there is no rejection (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"").
- **Ideation**: Fits as there is an explicit wish to die (""kill myself"") without specification of method, preparation, or immediacy. The conditional framing does not add immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Not met—no method, preparation, or words like ""tonight"" to trigger this category.
- **Attempt**: Not applicable—no past actions described.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  - Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions are considered (""I kill myself"").
  - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so hierarchy not triggered.
  - Immediacy trumps: No immediacy, so ideation stands.
  - Rejection downgrade: No rejection, so no downgrade to indicator.
  - Output exactly one category: IDEATION is the best fit.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""ways to kill myself"".
   - Indirect death references: ""die in combat"", ""my death seems [like] the ultimate answer"".
   - Emotional markers: ""hopeless"", ""hated myself"", ""mentally exhausting"", ""everything I earned was just mooching"".
   - Specific methods: ""using a phone charger"" (as substitute for rope).
   - Preparations: ""searching about ways to kill myself and find it to look like an accident"".
   - Past actions: ""first time I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"".

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: ""I tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts"" show personal ownership.
   - No disavowal: Thoughts are presented as persistent (""It gets harder everyday"") without rejection. The family pain is a deterrent but doesn't negate intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past: Clear descriptions of suicide attempts (phone charger incident, ""multiple attempts"").
   - Present: Active research into suicide methods (""recently began searching"").
   - Future: Non-specific timing for current ideation (""ways to kill myself"" lacks ""tonight""/""now"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start → ""tried committing suicide"" and ""multiple attempts"" are explicit past suicide actions → **ATTEMPT** (Rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → Attempt, overriding concurrent ideation/behavior).

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES VERIFICATION**:
1. Writer-focused: All references are to the user’s own actions.
2. Temporal hierarchy: Past attempt (""tried committing"") triggers Attempt category, superseding current behavior/ideation.
3. No immediacy phrases (""tonight""/""now"") to override hierarchy.
4. No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") to downgrade.
5. Single output required.

201,"Found a new best friend. who was also just faking everything. I dont understand why nobody cares about me at all, i show nothing but respect and kindness to them but they just fake everything, then when i figure it out im just more dead inside then if they just told me to stop in the first place. Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None found. Phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: ""im just more dead inside"" is metaphorical (e.g., emotional numbness) and not a literal reference to death or dying.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I dont understand why nobody cares about me"", ""im done with everything"") and worthlessness (""getting no results"") are present, but no explicit unbearable physical/emotional pain tied to suicide.
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No mention of suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" refers to relational efforts, not self-harm).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I want to die""). ""Done with everything"" expresses frustration and emotional exhaustion but is not an explicit suicide desire.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described (e.g., no ""my brain tells me to"").
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal of suicidal thoughts because none are expressed; the distress is relational, not suicidal.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Describes historical relational betrayals (""Found a new best friend... faking everything"") and past efforts (""trying my best""), but no past suicide actions.
- **Present intent**: No current plans for suicide (e.g., no ""tonight"" or immediate action).
- **Future ideation**: No future-oriented suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""someday I will end it"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past suicide attempt?** No → Proceed.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent; ""done with everything"" is vague distress, not actionable. No method, preparation, or immediacy → Does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit desire (e.g., ""want to die"" is absent). ""Dead inside"" is metaphorical, not active ideation → Does not qualify for IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes: Distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphors (""dead inside""), and no rejected thoughts but no suicidal content. Fits INDICATOR per definition (general unhappiness without actionable suicide intent).

### Key Considerations from Definitions and Rules
- **Category Definitions**: INDICATOR includes ""general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" and ""metaphorical death references"" with no active suicidal desire. This matches the post.
- **Irreducible Rules**: 
  - Writer-focused: Content is solely about the user's emotional state, not others.
  - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, behavior, or ideation to override.
  - Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present.
  - Rejection downgrade: Not applicable (no suicidal thoughts to reject).
  - Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is the best fit.

Final classification is INDICATOR, as the post expresses distress and metaphorical language without evidence of suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt.

202,I think I can jump off. It's less scary because there are some trees and mud below. I'm getting more courage to jump out of my bedroom window. Hopefully I can do it soon.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""jump off"" (method)  
   - Specific method: ""jump out of my bedroom window"" + environmental details (""trees and mud"")  
   - Preparation: Scouting location feasibility (""less scary because... trees and mud"")  
   - Intent progression: ""getting more courage"" + ""hopefully I can do it soon""  
   - No past attempts, emotional markers, or rejection noted.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: First-person ownership (""I think I can,"" ""I'm getting,"" ""I can do it"")  
   - No disavowal or framing as intrusive thoughts.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future intent (""soon""), but paired with concrete preparation (method/location scouting).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → **Rule out ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit intent + specific method (""jump out of my bedroom window"") + preparation (assessing location) → **Triggers BEHAVIOR per Rule 3 (capability demonstrated)**.  
   - ""Soon"" implies nearer-term intent than non-specific ideation → **Not IDEATION**.  
   - No rejection → **Not INDICATOR**.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION**:  
- Writer-focused (all ""I"" statements).  
- Preparation (method/location details) overrides non-immediate timeline per BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- No downgrade factors.

203,"Should I tell my mom about my issues. I know most peoples first reaction is ""yes, having help only makes it better"" but I feel like I don't really have that relationship with her. There's a lot of mental illness in my family and she herself has been through a lot and overcame it, I feel like she wants me to be this perfect being who has no issues and is going to be rich and successful whether I like it or not. When ever she notices I'm low energy and asks me about it sounds so accusatory, ""what's the matter with you"" and such. There might be some benefit in getting my parents involved but the fuck I am going to do after, go see a therapist? I hate talking about myself and we'd probably have to do meetings online and if I have to look at one more person through a screen I'm gonna scream. Besides I feel like I'd just waste their time. It would be easier to keep it to myself but sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes. This is already too long, if anyone has advice or can at least relate it'd be appreciated.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (""suicide"" not mentioned directly).  
   - Indirect death references: None.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""depression hits really hard""), worthlessness (""waste their time""), guilt/self-blame.  
   - Specific methods: None described.  
   - **Preparations**: Explicitly states ""I'm writing suicide notes"" during depressive episodes.  
   - Past actions: No mention of prior attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" absent).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Implicit in note-writing but framed as passive (""next thing I know"").  
   - Rejection noted? **No disavowal** of suicidal thoughts/actions. Writer describes note-writing as an outcome of depression without rejecting the urge.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: None (no ""last week I wrote notes"").  
   - Present intent: Recurrent but non-immediate (""sometimes depression hits... I'm writing"").  
   - Future ideation: No ""tonight"" or specific timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) Past attempt? → **No** (""writing notes"" ≠ attempt).  
   - b) Explicit intent + method/preparation? → **Yes** (preparation: suicide notes).  
     - *Rules applied*:  
       - Preparation (note-writing) → **Behavior**.  
       - No immediacy (""tonight"") but preparation alone suffices per framework.  
       - No downgrade (no rejection of intent).  

</thinking>  
Final Classification: **behavior**  

**Key Justification**:  
- Suicide note-writing is explicit **preparation** (Step 1), qualifying as ""Behavior"" per framework rules regardless of timeline.  
- Absence of disavowal (Step 2) and higher-tier categories (attempt) confirms classification.  
- *Note*: While distress dominates the post, the concrete disclosure of preparatory action overrules general despair.",behavior,True

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""hope i die""  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""No one cares""), worthlessness (""not even me""), despair (""fuck me fuck da world"")  
   - **Absent**: Methods, preparations, past actions, or indirect death references beyond ""hope i die"".  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Passive expression: ""hope i die"" frames desire as a wish, not active ownership.  
   - **No rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present-focused hopelessness, **no timeline** (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit desire (""hope i die"") but **no method/preparation/immediacy** → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - Explicit suicide desire (""hope i die"") without plan/timeline → Matches IDEATION.  
   - Distress/hopelessness present, but IDEATION overrules due to explicit death wish.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused: All expressions are self-referential.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No higher-priority evidence (attempt/behavior).  
- ""Hope i die"" lacks immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  
- No rejection to downgrade.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - Indirect death references: None (no phrases like ""not wake up"").  
   - Emotional markers: Frustration (""fuck""), but no explicit hopelessness/worthlessness.  
   - Specific methods: ""Cut"" implies self-harm via cutting.  
   - Preparations: None (no acquiring means, notes, etc.).  
   - Past actions: ""Just cut"" describes a recent self-harm act.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - No passive experience or rejection of suicidal thoughts.  
   - Focuses solely on a physical action (""cut"") without expressing intent to die.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past action: ""Just cut"" indicates a completed act.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) Past suicide attempt? The post describes self-harm (""cut too deep""), but **lacks evidence of suicidal intent**. The framework requires confirmed suicidal intent for ""attempt"" (e.g., ""tried to kill myself"").  
   - b) Explicit intent + method/preparation? No stated desire to die.  
   - c) Explicit desire without plan? No wish to die expressed.  
   - d) **Distress without actionable suicide intent**: The post signals distress through self-harm and frustration, but no suicidal desire, plan, or intent is present. Falls under ""indicator"" per category definitions.  

**Key Clarifications**:  
   - Non-suicidal self-harm (like cutting without stated suicidal intent) defaults to ""indicator"" as it reflects distress without actionable suicide risk.  
   - ""Attempt"" requires confirmed suicidal intent, which is absent here.  
   - Irreducible Rule 1: Writer-focused—no irrelevant context (e.g., others' actions).

They only do that so they can feel good about themselves. ""Ah I'm such a good person"" they say to themselves. You're not. You're an attention hungry piece of shit that feeds off the misery of others",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - No explicit suicide references: The post contains phrases like ""don't do it!"" and ""you have to live for everyone else!"", but these are attributed to others and criticized by the writer. The writer does not use direct terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.
   - No indirect death references: There are no phrases from the writer suggesting death (e.g., ""not wake up,"" ""be gone""). The focus is on emotional distress and criticism of others.
   - Emotional markers present: Strong expressions of anger, frustration, hopelessness, and feeling misunderstood (e.g., ""tired,"" ""pathetic,"" ""misery of others,"" ""what I'm feeling is something I do by choice""). However, these are not explicitly tied to suicidal intent.
   - No specific methods: No mention of pills, hanging, or other means of self-harm.
   - No preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or planning.
   - No past actions: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no use of ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - No active endorsement: The writer does not claim ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I want to die""). The post revolves around rejecting others' responses, not expressing personal desire for suicide.
   - No passive experience: Suicidal thoughts are not presented as intrusive or unwanted by the writer.
   - Rejection noted, but not of suicidal thoughts: The writer disavows the motives of others (e.g., calling them ""attention hungry piece of shit""), but this is not a rejection of personal suicidal ideation since none is expressed.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - No past, present, or future references to suicide: The post is entirely focused on the current emotional reaction to others' comments, with no timeline or context for self-harm.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → not ATTEMPT.
   - b) No explicit suicide intent, method, preparation, or immediacy → not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die"") → not IDEATION.
   - d) ONLY distress (anger, hopelessness) and metaphors (""feeds off the misery of others"") without actionable suicide intent → INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
- Writer-focused: Mentions of ""don't do it!"" are attributed to others and ignored; the writer's own content shows distress only.
- Temporal hierarchy: Not triggered, as no higher-level categories apply.
- Immediacy: Not present.
- Rejection downgrade: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are expressed to reject.
- Output exactly one category: INDICATOR fits as the sole category.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses significant emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit or implicit suicidal intent, plan, or behavior. It falls under INDICATOR due to general unhappiness and criticism of others' responses.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""wanna die"" (direct expression of death wish).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""struggle to get up""), worthlessness (""bullied,"" ""friends all left""), anhedonia (""find everything boring"").  
   - **No** methods, preparations, past attempts, or timelines.  
   - Key ambivalence: ""wanna die but dont at the same time"" (simultaneous rejection).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active desire (""wanna die"") is explicitly countered by self-rejection (""but dont at the same time"").  
   - Thoughts are framed as conflicted, not actionable.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - No past actions, plans, or time-bound statements (e.g., ""tonight"").

I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

   - Preparations: ""partially planning to die"" (vague, no specifics).

1. **Content Deconstruction**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""better off dead"", ""end it"", ""hang myself"", ""rest in peace""  
   - Indirect death references: ""living was a total fucking scam"" (implies futility of life)  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""no reason to keep going""), worthlessness (""ugly useless stupid""), unbearable pain (""suffer"", ""everything decent [...] taken from me"")  
   - Specific methods: ""hang myself"" with detailed plan (""drive out into the mountains [...] find a nice little spot"")  
   - Preparations: Location scouting (""hike [...] from paths and find a nice little spot"")  
   - Past actions: None described (mentions past ideation: ""too scared to end it"" but no actual attempts)  

2. **Intent Analysis**:  
   - Active endorsement: Direct ownership (""*I* could just drive"", ""*I* can rest"")  
   - No rejection: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). The phrase ""too scared to end it"" references past hesitation, not current rejection.  

3. **Temporal Framework**:  
   - Past: Historical suffering and ideation (""ever since I was a kid"")  
   - Present: Explicit current intent (""*now* I really don’t care anymore"")  
   - Future: Non-specific timing for action (""could"" implies potential rather than immediacy), but plan details (method/location) anchor it in actionable present.  

4. **Category Decision Tree**:  
   - a) No described past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""hang myself"") + specific method (hanging) + preparation (location scouting) → **BEHAVIOR** (fulfills criteria despite no exact timeline like ""tonight"").

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements like ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts."" The word ""suicidal"" is a clear, explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: No indirect phrases like ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die"" are present. The language is direct about suicidal feelings.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness is evident (""its supposed to get better but I just want to know when,"" ""hard to have any hope or motivation to go on,"" ""I'm just tired of all of it""). Worthlessness is implied through frustration with lack of progress despite efforts (e.g., listing self-care activities that aren't working), and unbearable pain is conveyed via exhaustion and the persistent nature of suffering (""its been years"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, hanging) or descriptions of how suicide might be carried out.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, scouting locations, or any concrete steps toward suicide.
- **Past actions**: The post describes ongoing suicidal thoughts but no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or ""overdosed""). References to others' recovery (""people that have recovered from being suicidal"") are not about the writer's own actions.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL):**
- **Active endorsement**: The writer directly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with statements like ""I am... suicidal"" and ""dealing with suicidal thoughts."" This shows active personal identification with the desire, rather than presenting it as external or involuntary.
- **Passive experience**: There is no indication that thoughts are framed as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" language). The thoughts are described as a persistent, self-owned state.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"" or similar rejection). The writer expresses a desire for relief (""want to know when"" it gets better), which implies a wish for improvement but not a clear, active rejection of suicidal thoughts. This does not qualify for a downgrade to indicator.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
- **Past focus**: The post references a long-term struggle (""its been years"") but only as context for current feelings. No past suicide attempts or actions are described.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal thoughts are explicitly current (""I am still... suicidal,"" ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts""), but there is no indication of immediate plans (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific timelines for action).
- **Future ideation**: The ideation is ongoing but non-specific in timing (e.g., no ""someday I will"" statements). The focus is on the present experience of persistent thoughts without a future plan.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
- **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post discusses thoughts and feelings but no descriptions of past actions like ""tried to"" or ""attempted."" Rule 1 (writer-focused) confirms we ignore others' actions. → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** → Explicit intent is present (""unbelievably suicidal""), but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight""). Rule 3 (immediacy trumps) does not apply. → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → Yes. The writer expresses active suicidal desire (""I am... suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts"") without actionable elements like a method or imminent timeline. This matches the ideation definition: ""active suicidal desire without actionable plan."" → IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → No. While distress and hopelessness are present, they are coupled with explicit suicidal desire, so it does not meet the criteria for indicator (which requires no active suicidal desire). Rule 4 (rejection downgrade) does not apply due to lack of disavowal.

**Final Classification Reasoning:**  
The post clearly expresses active suicidal ideation without evidence of a plan, preparations, or immediacy. The temporal hierarchy (Rule 2) and other irreducible rules support ideation as the category. Distress and hopelessness are present but do not override the explicit suicidal desire.

I'm a 21m and the only way I can fix my fucked up self is therapy the problem is the only way I can afford it is if my parents help me pay for it. I can't tell them about my depression and anxiety I can't tell them I need therapy I'm scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy. I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore so I really need it but idk what to di,0,indicator,"### Thinking Process

I will systematically apply the provided framework to analyze the user's post step by step. The goal is to classify it into one of the four categories: **indicator**, **ideation**, **behavior**, or **attempt**.

#### 1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**
   - **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains no direct mentions of suicide, such as ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""  
   - **Indirect death references**: There are no indirect references to death or dying, such as ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die.""  
   - **Emotional markers**: The post expresses significant distress, including hopelessness (""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore""), worthlessness (""my depression and anxiety,"" ""fucked up self""), and fear of judgment (""scared they'll just think it's an excuse for me to be lazy""). However, these are framed as reasons for needing therapy, not as expressions of suicidal intent.  
   - **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping, firearms).  
   - **Preparations**: No evidence of planning or preparation for suicide, such as acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.  
   - **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts or self-harm (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" ""overdosed"").  

   **Summary**: The content focuses on the writer's mental health struggles (depression, anxiety, low motivation) and barriers to accessing therapy. There are no suicide-specific references, methods, preparations, or past actions. Emotional distress is present but not linked to suicidal thoughts.

#### 2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**
   - **Active endorsement**: The writer does not express any active suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The core message is about seeking help (""I need therapy more than anything else"").  
   - **Passive experience**: There are no descriptions of intrusive or passive suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to die"").  
   - **Rejection noted**: Since no suicidal thoughts are expressed, there is nothing to reject or disavow. The writer's fear is about parental perception (""they'll just think it's an excuse""), not about resisting suicidal urges.  

   **Summary**: No suicidal intent—active, passive, or rejected—is present. The post centers on distress and a desire for therapy, not self-harm.

#### 3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**
   - **Past focus**: No references to past suicidal events or attempts. The mention of ""depression and anxiety"" is ongoing but not tied to past actions.  
   - **Present intent**: No indication of current suicidal plans, methods, or imminent actions. The writer discusses present struggles (""don't have the motivation to get up"") but not in a suicidal context.  
   - **Future ideation**: No expressions of future suicidal thoughts, even non-specific ones (e.g., ""someday I might""). The future focus is on needing therapy, not on dying.  

   **Summary**: The temporal elements relate solely to the writer's current mental state and future need for help, with no suicidal timeline.

#### 4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**
   - Start the decision tree:  
     a) **Any past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post has no references to past attempts, so this is not ""attempt.""  
     b) **Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)** → No explicit suicide intent, and no methods, preparations, or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""). Thus, not ""behavior.""  
     c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy** → No explicit desire to die or end life (e.g., ""want to die"" is absent). Thus, not ""ideation.""  
     d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts** → This fits. The post contains general distress (depression, anxiety, hopelessness, low motivation) and metaphors for emotional pain (""fucked up self,"" ""motivation to get up""), but all are non-suicidal. There are no rejected suicidal thoughts because none are expressed.  

   **Summary**: The post aligns with the ""indicator"" category, as it shows distress without actionable suicide intent.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- **Writer-focused**: Analysis is on the writer's own experiences; no mentions of others' actions.
- **Temporal hierarchy**: Not applicable, as no higher-level categories (attempt, behavior, or ideation) are present.
- **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to override.
- **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts to reject.
- **Output exactly one**: Only ""indicator"" fits based on the evidence.

213,i watch a lot of crime videos on youtube and they just be giving me ideas. i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as i can because i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that. butttt i just saw a video about a woman who killed her husband by putting eye drops in his beverages and i'd be lying if i said that didn't give me an idea of a new suicide method 🧍‍♀️. *sigh*. i wish i wasn't like this :(,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal thoughts"" is directly stated.
   - Indirect death references: None beyond the suicide context.
   - Emotional markers: Distress and self-frustration (""i wish i wasn't like this"", ""sigh"").
   - Specific methods: ""eye drops"" as a potential suicide method is mentioned, derived from a crime video.
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts; only current thoughts are discussed.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer acknowledges personal suicidal thoughts (""my suicidal thoughts""), but explicitly rejects acting on them (""i really don't want to have to do that"").
   - Passive experience: Thoughts are framed as intrusive and externally triggered (from crime videos ""giving me ideas""), with active suppression (""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts"").
   - Rejection noted: Strong disavowal is present (""i know deep down that i really don't want to have to do that"" and ""i wish i wasn't like this""), indicating the thoughts are unwanted.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No references to past attempts or actions.
   - Present intent: No immediate plan or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""); the method idea is hypothetical.
   - Future ideation: Non-specific; the method is a general ""idea"" without stated intent to act.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide desire is present (""suicidal thoughts""), but paired with rejection and no preparation/immediacy → Does not meet BEHAVIOR threshold.
   - c) Suicidal desire exists, but rejection and lack of plan/immediacy downgrade it from IDEATION.
   - d) Core elements are distress (""i wish i wasn't like this""), intrusive thoughts (video ""giving me ideas""), and explicit rejection → Matches INDICATOR.

Irreducible rules applied:
   - Writer-focused: Ignored the crime video's content (about others) and focused on the writer's personal experience.
   - Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so hierarchy not triggered.
   - Immediacy trumps: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so no escalation.
   - Rejection downgrade: Explicit disavowal (""i really don't want to"") moves this from higher-risk categories to INDICATOR.
   - Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is the best fit.

Planned everything out. Picked a time and place. Then sabotaged myself. I can't even fucking free myself of my problems without blocking my own shot jfc. I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicide note"", ""free myself of my problems"" (euphemism for suicide), ""do it this time"".  
   - Preparation evidence: ""wrote a suicide note"", ""primed and ready to be posted"", ""planned everything out"", ""picked a time and place"".  
   - Past action: ""sabotaged myself"" (aborted attempt), ""blocking my own shot"" (self-interruption).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""common denominator in all my problems""), craving for calm (""coax the feeling back... rush of calm"").  
   - Method/timeline specificity: Explicit past plan with time/place, though no current method stated.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement of past intent (""I felt so calm... decided how and when"").  
   - Current ambivalence (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") without explicit rejection.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - **Past**: Detailed description of preparations and aborted attempt (""a month ago... sabotaged myself"").  
   - **Present/Future**: Non-specific resurgence of desire (""maybe... this time"") without immediate timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - **Step a)**: ""Sabotaged myself"" + ""blocking my own shot"" confirms a past suicide attempt (aborted after preparation).  
   - **Irreducible Rule #2**: Past attempt overrules all other categories.  

</thinking>  
Final Classification: **attempt**  

*Rationale*: The post describes concrete past actions meeting the Attempt definition (""sabotaged myself"" after preparing a note, plan, time, and place). Although current ideation exists, the framework prioritizes documented suicidal behavior over concurrent expressions.",ideation,True
215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast. I wish I had love in my life, I wish I had people who would hug me or tell me I was lovable, who would tell me I wasnt stupid and I was going to be okay. I am hanging on by threads at this moment. trying to find things in the world to enjoy like I did when i was much younger. As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""  
- **Indirect death references**: ""the world would not change at all if I were gone"" (metaphorical disappearance).  
- **Emotional markers**: Profound hopelessness (""will never be loved,"" ""endless pain""), worthlessness (""stain upon the world""), isolation (""so alone""), and despair (""bottom of a rotten pit"").  
- **Methods/preparations**: None mentioned.  
- **Past actions**: No references to suicide attempts.  
- **Rejection noted**: Explicitly states ""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present.""  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: No expressions of active suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
- **Passive experience**: Distress is framed as endured suffering (""I am suffering,"" ""I feel like an outcast"").  
- **Rejection**: Clear disavowal: ""the reason I stay"" indicates conscious rejection of acting on despair.

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""it would be better if I was dead"", ""eternal sleep? Sign me up please"".  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""it won't lead to anything""), worthlessness (""barely any problems""), emptiness after activities.  
   - **No methods/preparations**: No mention of plans, means, or locations.  
   - **No past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts.  
   - **Rejection present**: Explicitly states suicide is ""selfish"" and lists barriers (dog, loved ones, guilt).

   - Past actions: References a prior hotline call where they had **no method or plan**, and involuntary hospitalization. No self-harm/attempt described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - ""10x more suicidal"" is a **past emotional state**, not current active endorsement.  
   - Current focus: Seeking anonymous help to **prevent** intervention (""can't track me,"" ""won't call anyone"").  
   - Explicit rejection: Avoidance of police/psych ward due to prior negative outcome.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

   - ❌ No **behavior** (no current method, prep, or timeline).  
   - ❌ No **ideation** (no active wish to die *now*; ""suicidal"" is past-tense).

I have no more strenght, i feel like killing my self every day and it huts so much. Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done, ive wrote here before and gave it a chance to see what life has to offer but shit, nothing here for me. over and over again only to be dissapointed. Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""feel like killing my self every day""  
   - Preparations: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done""  
   - Emotional markers: ""so lonely,"" ""so fucking tired,"" ""no more strenght,"" ""hurts so much""  
   - Temporal cues: ""every day"" (chronic ideation), ""this might be my final good bye"" (imminent intent)  
   - **No past attempts** described (only historical distress: ""gave it a chance over and over"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal thoughts (""feel like killing my self"") with **no rejection** (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  
   - Preparations (note, bills, testament) confirm serious intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Chronic ideation: ""every day""  
   - **Imminent intent**: ""this might be my final good bye"" implies immediate action.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - → No past attempt described (rules out ATTEMPT).  
   - → **Explicit suicide intent + specific preparations** (suicide note, testament) + **imminent timeline** (""final good bye"") → **BEHAVIOR**.  

**Key Rule Applications**:  
- Preparations (note/will) + farewell language → **Behavior** per ""Critical Expansion"" (imminent intent suffices).  
- ""Final good bye"" overrides non-specific ""every day"" ideation (Immediacy Trumps rule).  
- No disclaimers (e.g., ""but I won’t"") → no downgrade.

222,"I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode. I feel like I can't keep it to myself anymore or else i'm going to kms. I can't talk to anyone tho, and anyone i try to talk to i share a tiny little bit and never talk to them again or i just tell them i'm healed now thank you! I only feel comfortable talking to one person and I don't know why I can't talk to anyone else I just can't I can't open up to anyone but them, not even my mom. The thing is this lady is like the mother of one of the most popular girls and she's also a teacher and I barely know her even tho i've known her pretty much my whole life. I know other teachers who have known me a long time and I can't talk to them I can't talk to a complete stranger either, I always end up just saying i'm good now when in reality i'm not. I tried talking to this teacher once and we talked like for 4 months and I totally embarrassed myself and I told her I was sorry for bothering her with my life constantly, when she has her own life and job to worry about. I told her I won't bother her ever again. and so I didn't. I tried getting help from other people but I just end up saying i'm good now and I stop talking to them. I'm not ok. I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon. I'm not sure when but I know I am. I can't get these thoughts out of my head. I can't stop cutting. I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog. I haven't talked to anyone in a long while and everyone thinks i'm ok. I'm not though. I don't know what to do anymore. I think i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon. Thank you for reading.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""i'm going to kms"" (shorthand for ""kill myself""), ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm about to kms"", ""i'm just gonna keep it all in and kms soon"". These are direct statements of suicidal intent.
- **Indirect death references**: None prominent; all references are explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm holding it all in and i'm about to explode"", ""I don't know what to do anymore""), worthlessness (""I totally embarrassed myself"", ""I told her I was sorry for bothering her""), and references to unbearable emotional pain (""I'm not ok"", ""I can't stop cutting"").
- **Specific methods**: ""I can't stop cutting"" implies self-harm as a potential method, but it is not explicitly linked to a suicide plan (e.g., no mention of using cutting for suicide). No other methods (e.g., pills, firearms) are described.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The focus is on internal struggle and intent, not concrete actions.
- **Past actions**: References to past help-seeking (""I tried talking to this teacher"", ""I tried getting help from other people""), but no description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" in a suicidal context). Self-harm (""cutting"") is ongoing but not framed as a past suicide attempt.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with clear statements: ""I finally accepted the fact that i'm going to kill myself very soon"" and ""I'm about to kms"". This shows direct personal intent.
- **Passive experience**: Intrusive thoughts are mentioned (""I can't get these thoughts out of my head""), but they are coupled with active endorsement (e.g., ""accepted the fact""), reducing passive framing.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The line ""I'm about to kms, just not yet though I can't leave my dog"" indicates a delay due to a barrier (the dog), not a rejection of intent. The overall tone is one of resignation and acceptance.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Descriptions of past help-seeking (e.g., talking to a teacher for 4 months), but no past suicide attempts.
- **Present intent**: Expressions like ""I'm about to kms"" suggest immediacy, but this is qualified with ""just not yet though"", indicating no immediate action. ""I can't stop cutting"" describes ongoing self-harm but not as an imminent suicide method.
- **Future ideation**: Dominant theme, with non-specific timing: ""I'm going to kill myself very soon"", ""I'm not sure when but I know I am"", and ""kms soon"". ""Very soon"" is vague and lacks concrete immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No. Mentions of ""tried"" refer to help-seeking, not suicidal actions. → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: Explicit intent is present (""kill myself very soon""), but:
  - No specific method for suicide: ""Cutting"" is mentioned as self-harm but not explicitly as a suicide plan.
  - No preparation evidence (e.g., no means acquisition).
  - No immediate timeline: ""Very soon"" and ""about to"" are undercut by ""not yet"" due to the dog, so no imminent threat (e.g., not ""tonight""). → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes. Clear expressions of desire (""I'm going to kill myself very soon"") with no actionable plan or immediacy. → IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?**: No, because of explicit suicidal desire. Emotional distress is present but not standalone.

### Key Considerations from Rules and Definitions
- **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or current behavior, so IDEATION is not overruled.
- **Immediacy**: ""Very soon"" is not specific enough for BEHAVIOR; ""tonight"" would be required.
- **Rejection**: No disavowal of intent (e.g., ""but I won't do it""); the dog is a delay factor, not a rejection.
- **Writer-focused**: All content is self-referential; no irrelevant mentions of others.
- **Category boundaries**: IDEATION includes explicit desire without plan/immediacy. BEHAVIOR would require specifics like ""tonight"" or method details, which are absent.

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

   - **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""I shouldn't have to stay alive for them""), worthlessness (""grow up"" criticism), anger (""They deserve to live with the burden"").  
   - **Past actions**: None described (note discovery is passive, not an attempt).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement**: Direct ownership (""I wanna kill myself"", ""wish I could shoot myself"").  
   - **Rejection noted?**: None. Defiance (""I don't care"") reinforces intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**

- **Past actions**: None (no ""tried"" or ""attempted"").  
- **Other**: Farewell/apology (""Sorry to anyone..."", ""Love you Mom..."") suggests closure.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Implied in ""The end... feels right now,"" but lacks explicit ownership (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
- **Passive experience/rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").

When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy.

Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains multiple explicit references, including ""serious thoughts about suicide,"" ""want to commit suicide,"" and ""kill myself.""
- **Indirect death references**: None prominent; references are direct (e.g., ""commit suicide"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (e.g., home conflicts, feeling unappreciated, gender-based unfairness), worthlessness (e.g., being called lazy, doubting authenticity of depression), and distress from social anxiety and seasonal depression.
- **Specific methods**: Mentions ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself,"" but no concrete method details (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: Research is described, but no evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. Research alone is not considered actionable preparation per framework (requires concrete evidence like ""bought pills"").
- **Past actions**: No description of actual suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). References to thoughts (""had serious thoughts"") are not actions.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I actually want to commit suicide,"" ""serious thoughts about suicide""). Thoughts are presented as personal reactions to triggers (family conflicts), not passive/intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no phrases like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted?**: Writer expresses doubt about authenticity (e.g., ""feel like I'm doing it for attention,"" ""I'm faking it""), but this is self-doubt about depression, not an explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Suicidal desire is still affirmed in context (""actually want to commit suicide"").

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Describes historical suicidal thoughts during February (e.g., ""for the whole month of February I had serious thoughts about suicide"").
- **Present intent**: No current plan or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or ""immediately""). Thoughts are conditional on triggers (e.g., ""when we fight,"" ""that's what triggers me"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific, recurring ideation tied to situational triggers (e.g., ""I could have these thoughts for days""), but no fixed timeline.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No. Only thoughts and research described; no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit suicidal desire (""want to commit suicide"") is present, but no specific method (research is vague), no preparation evidence, and no immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes. Clear desire to die (e.g., ""want to commit suicide"") with no actionable plan or immediacy. Research for ""easy painless ways"" is non-specific and part of ideation per framework → IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/rejected thoughts?**: No. Distress and self-doubt are present, but explicit suicidal desire overrides this (see Irreducible Rule 4: rejection must be explicit, e.g., ""I don't actually want to""). Doubt here is about depression authenticity, not suicidal intent → Not INDICATOR.

**Key Boundary Checks**:
- **Behavior threshold**: No ""tonight"" or similar immediacy; research alone doesn't qualify as preparation.
- **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable—doubt is not explicit disavowal of intent (e.g., writer still says ""actually want to commit suicide"").
- **Temporal hierarchy**: No higher-level evidence (attempt/behavior) to override ideation.

**Conclusion**: Category is IDEATION per explicit, non-actionable suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicide"" is mentioned in the context of normalization (""Death and suicide need to be normalized""), but not as a personal action.  
   - Indirect death references: References to ""the other side"" and a state without ""human Emotions,"" ""hunger,"" or ""body or mind"" imply death/afterlife concepts.

   - Specific methods: None described.  
   - Preparations: None indicated.  
   - Past actions: No mention of prior attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - No active personal endorsement of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die""). The phrase ""suicide need to be normalized"" is a general societal comment, not a statement of personal intent.  
   - No passive or intrusive thoughts described.  
   - No rejection (e.g., ""but I won't do it""), but also no ownership of suicidal thoughts.

   - Entirely abstract/generalized: Focuses on philosophical concepts of death and societal normalization, with no past, present, or future personal timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) No explicit personal suicide intent, no method/preparation, no immediacy → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) No explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die"") → Not IDEATION.  
   - d) Distress (""Life is useless"") + metaphorical death references (""the other side"") + no active suicidal desire → INDICATOR.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:  
   - Writer-focused: Mentions of ""suicide"" are societal, not personal.  
   - Temporal hierarchy: No competing higher categories.  
   - Immediacy: Absent.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""  
   - Indirect death references: Present (""thought of death,"" ""never feel pain,"" ""to be nothing,"" ""let go""). Framed as philosophical/abstract.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness implied (""never deal with the hassle"") but not explicit personal despair. Focuses on death as relief.  
   - Specific methods/preparations/past actions: None.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of personal suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Death is discussed abstractly (""the thought of death"").  
   - No rejection of thoughts, but no ownership either. Tone is reflective, not actionable.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - No past, present, or future timelines. Entirely hypothetical/abstract (""thought of death"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt (a).  
   - No explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy (b).  
   - No explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""want to die"") (c).  
   - Metaphorical death references (""to be nothing,"" ""black sea"") without actionable intent → **INDICATOR** (d).  

**Key Justification**:  
- Romanticizes death as escape but lacks personal ownership of suicidal intent, specificity, or timeline.  
- Falls under ""metaphorical death references"" in Indicator category.  
- Rules applied: Rejection not needed (no intent to downgrade), writer-focused (no irrelevant context).

233,"i'm getting my covid test results tomorrow. and i'll be deciding what to do once i get them. i've been feeling like absolute shit for the past few weeks. i've had sore throat, a possible fever, and now i have cough. aside from that, i've been feeling like a fucking outcast from everyone. my dad keeps getting mad at me for the smallest things while my friends basically don't fucking care about me. i'm so fucking tired and i want to reach out but there's literally no one i can go to. i'm literally just stuck in my head and it doesn't help that i'm also sick. all my life i just wanted to feel like i belong somewhere but i never fucking knew where. all i ever wanted was for someone to care about me so that i'd have something to hold onto, something that would give me another fucking reason to live. in the end, i receive jackshit. there's so much going on in my head that i can't even begin where to start or even know how to fix. but now, it all comes down to my covid results. if i'm negative, i'll run away. i'll leave everyone behind and whatever happens to me by then happens, it wouldn't matter anymore. if i'm positive, i'll kill myself. i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide, but not anymore. i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day. it doesn't fucking matter to me anymore. this is selfish and irrational, i know, but honestly i just want to make one decision for myself for once no matter how fucking selfish it is. my will to live like this is hanging by a thread and i don't think i can hold onto it any longer.",1,ideation,"### Thinking
I will apply the framework step-by-step to classify the user's post into one of the suicide risk categories: indicator, ideation, behavior, or attempt.

#### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements like ""i'll kill myself"" and ""committing suicide"".
- **Indirect death references**: Includes phrases like ""it wouldn't matter anymore"" and ""i don't see another day"", which are contextualized by explicit suicide intent.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (e.g., ""i'm so fucking tired"", ""will to live like this is hanging by a thread""), worthlessness (e.g., ""feeling like a fucking outcast"", ""friends basically don't fucking care about me""), and unbearable pain (e.g., ""so much going on in my head"").
- **Specific methods**: The writer mentions ""use any method i can"", but this is vague and non-specific (no details like pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The suicide plan is conditional on COVID test results (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself""), but no concrete preparations are described.
- **Past actions**: References past fear of death that prevented suicide (""i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back""), but no description of an actual suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" with details of self-harm).

#### Step 2: Intent Analysis (Critical)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer clearly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct, first-person statements like ""i'll kill myself"" and ""i'll use any method i can"". There is no indication these are passive or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting thoughts are involuntary (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" without ownership).
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal of intent. The writer acknowledges the decision may be ""selfish and irrational"" but reinforces commitment (""i just want to make one decision for myself""). There is no statement like ""but I won't do it"" to downgrade the risk.

#### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Describes historical feelings (e.g., fear of death that ""used to"" hold them back, ongoing distress for weeks), but no past suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: The decision to act is tied to an immediate timeline based on COVID test results coming ""tomorrow"". The writer states ""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"" and ""i'll use any method i can as long as i don't see another day"", indicating intent to act imminently after results are received.
- **Future ideation**: The suicidal desire is not vague or non-specific; it is contingent on a proximate event (tomorrow's results), placing it in the imminent category.

#### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at the decision tree:
  - **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post references past fear but no actual attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Thus, not ATTEMPT.
  - **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)** → 
    - Explicit suicide intent: Present (""i'll kill myself"").
    - Specific method/preparation: ""Use any method"" is vague, so no specific method. No preparations described.
    - Immediate timeline: Yes. The plan is triggered by COVID results ""tomorrow"", which is imminent (comparable to ""this weekend"" in the framework rules). The statement ""i'll kill myself"" upon a positive result expresses immediate intent.
    - Therefore, based on the rule ""Immediacy trumps: 'tonight' beats non-specific ideation"" and ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details"", this meets criteria for BEHAVIOR.
  - **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy** → Not applicable, as there is an imminent timeline.
  - **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts** → Not applicable, due to explicit suicidal intent and lack of rejection.

#### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: Only the writer's actions/intent are considered (e.g., ""i'll kill myself"" is self-referential; no mentions of others).
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt (rules out ATTEMPT), and immediacy (tomorrow) overrides non-specific ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: ""Tomorrow"" for the decision point is imminent, elevating this from ideation to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""); the writer commits to the decision.
5. **Output exactly one**: BEHAVIOR is the most severe applicable category based on the analysis.

234,"Failrure. I cant fucking kill myself ptoperlly, took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing. What shoul i do kill mslef and stop being a burden and a disappoinment. Pleasw help, i have nobody else",3,attempt,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""kill myself"" (appearing twice, with variations like ""kill mslef"").
- **Indirect death references**: None present; all references are direct.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""stop being a burden and a disappoinment"") and worthlessness (""failure"").
- **Specific methods**: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (zopiclone is a sleep medication, indicating pill overdose as a method).
- **Preparations**: The act of taking the pills implies prior acquisition and use of means.
- **Past actions**: Clear description of a past suicide attempt: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" (ineffective overdose with suicidal intent).

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I cant fucking kill myself"", ""kill mslef"") without framing them as passive or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; language is self-directed and active.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The plea ""Pleasw help"" signals distress but does not reject suicidal intent.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Dominated by the described overdose attempt (""took... and nothing"").
- **Present intent**: ""What shoul i do kill mslef"" suggests active consideration of suicide now, but this is secondary to the past action.
- **Future ideation**: No specific future timing mentioned; the question implies immediacy but is less concrete than the past attempt.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at decision tree point **a)**: A past suicide attempt is explicitly described (""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing""), which qualifies as an ""attempt"" under the definitions (actual self-harm with suicidal intent, even if ineffective). This triggers the irreducible rule **2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation)**, overriding concurrent elements like present suicidal desire (""What shoul i do kill mslef""). No rejection or downgrade applies (rule 4).

I've been made fun of in school for being slow at tests and other things. It fucking pisses me off seeing NTs acting normal all the time while I'm over here feeling like I'm trying to navigate through Hell every fucking day. I feel like I don't belong in society. I might kill myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""I might kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I feel like I don't belong in society""), worthlessness (""treated by other guys as a lesser human""), and unbearable pain (""navigate through Hell every fucking day"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: Descriptions of historical mistreatment (""made fun of in school"") but no references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""I might kill myself"" indicates ownership of suicidal thoughts, as it is framed as a personal possibility (""I"" statements).
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., not described as ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The statement stands without qualification.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Historical descriptions of bullying and difficulties, but no past suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""); ""might"" implies uncertainty and non-immediacy.
- **Future ideation**: ""I might kill myself"" suggests non-specific future suicidal desire without a concrete plan or timeframe.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal desire (""I might kill myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes, ""I might kill myself"" expresses active suicidal desire, but lacks actionable details (method, preparation, or immediacy) → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because explicit suicidal desire is present; emotional distress alone would qualify for INDICATOR, but the suicide reference elevates it.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: Post discusses the writer's own experiences; no references to others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No mention of past attempts or immediate plans, so IDEATION takes precedence over INDICATOR.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so BEHAVIOR is not triggered.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""), so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: IDEATION is the highest applicable category based on explicit desire without plan or immediacy.

**Final Classification**: IDEATION

   - Specific methods: ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil"" (overdose plan)  
   - Preparations: Implied by stated intent to act imminently (""in about a few minutes"")

   - No rejection: Absence of phrases like ""but I won’t do it"".  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present intent with imminent timeline: ""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes"".  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → No past attempt described.  
   - → Explicit desire present (""want to kill myself""), but **no** specific method/preparation **and no** immediate timeline → **Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria**.  
   - → Explicit suicide desire exists without actionable plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
   - → Not downgraded to INDICATOR (no rejection of thoughts).  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""last suicide attempt"" (direct mention).

I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing.

As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all.

I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. The post does not contain phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""  
- **Indirect death references**: Yes. The phrase ""hoping I will die in my sleep tonight"" implies a passive wish for death (similar to ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong evidence of hopelessness and despair, e.g., ""hurting,"" ""so depressed,"" ""everything is so exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up.""  
- **Specific methods**: None. Dying in sleep is not a self-inflicted method (like pills or jumping); it is a passive, uncontrollable event.  
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.  
- **Past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The desire for death is expressed passively (""hoping I will die"") rather than as an active intent to self-harm (e.g., ""I want to die"" as a call to action). The writer does not claim ownership of suicidal actions.  
- **Passive experience**: The death wish is framed as an outcome of emotional pain, not as intrusive thoughts.  
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The statement stands without rejection, but it lacks actionable suicidal intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events.  
- **Present intent**: The wish for death (""die in my sleep tonight"") has an immediate timeline (""tonight""), but it is not an actionable plan (e.g., ""doing it tonight"" implies self-initiated action).  
- **Future ideation**: Not applicable, as the timeline is immediate but passive.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start →  
  - a) **Any past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.  
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** No explicit suicide intent (e.g., ""want to die"" as self-harm is absent); dying in sleep is passive and not a method. Immediacy (""tonight"") exists, but without intent for self-action → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** The phrase ""hoping I will die"" expresses a desire to die, but it is not explicitly suicidal (i.e., focused on self-inflicted harm). It is a general death wish with immediacy (""tonight""), which conflicts with IDEATION's requirement for no immediacy. However, due to the passive context, it does not clearly fit IDEATION.  
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post centers on distress (emotional/physical pain) and a metaphorical death reference (""die in my sleep""). Per the clarification, ""I'm going to die soon"" without suicide context → INDICATOR. Similarly, ""hoping I will die in my sleep"" lacks suicidal context and is not actionable.

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION
1. **Writer-focused**: The post describes the writer's own feelings, not others' actions.  
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt, behavior, or clear ideation overrules the distress focus.  
3. **Immediacy trumps**: Immediacy (""tonight"") is present, but without explicit suicidal intent, it does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.  
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection, but the passive nature of the wish aligns with INDICATOR.  
5. **Output exactly one**: INDICATOR is the best fit.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses profound distress and a metaphorical death wish without explicit suicidal intent, plan, or action. It aligns with INDICATOR per the framework.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""overdose"" (contextually implies suicidal intent via ""wasn't enough to kill me"").  
   - Specific method: ""Zoloft overdose"" + quantitative details (""6 pills...300mg"").  
   - Past actions: ""took 6 pills"" at a specified time (""11:30"") with clear suicidal intent (""wasn't enough to kill me"").  
   - Emotional markers/physical state: ""slight nausea,"" ""really sweaty,"" anxiety about consequences (""will I be okay"").  
   - No rejection noted: Writer expresses concern about outcomes but does not disavow suicidal intent.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Ownership is explicit (""I took"") and directly tied to lethal outcome (""kill me"").  
   - No passive framing or disavowal of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: Action completed at ""11:30"" (historical description).  
   - Present discussion centers on aftermath, not future plans.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Step a: **Past suicide attempt described** → ""took 6 pills"" explicitly to die (confirmed by ""wasn't enough to kill me"").

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES VERIFICATION**  
- Writer-focused: All actions/statements are self-referential (""I took"").  
- Temporal hierarchy: Past attempt takes precedence.

   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Hopeless,"" ""I've felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"").  
   - Specific methods/preparations: **""I just want to find an actual suicide forum""** (indicates seeking resources but no explicit method/preparation).  
   - Past actions: None (no ""tried,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of past self-harm).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - No passive descriptions of intrusive thoughts.  
   - No explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts.  
   - The forum-seeking implies interest but falls short of personal intent (""want to find"" ≠ ""I will do"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""slash my wrists and die""  
   - Specific method: ""slash my wrists""  
   - Emotional markers: ""disgusting to look at,"" ""how low my expectations,"" despair over parental rejection  
   - Preparation/action: ""on the verge of trying"" implies imminent action  
   - No mention of past attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: ""on the verge of trying"" indicates immediacy (likely within hours/days).

That is the most bullshit phase I have ever heard. I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""I cannot wait to die"" directly expresses a desire for death, which is an explicit suicide reference.
- **Indirect death references**: ""at least the pain will all be gone"" implies death as relief from suffering.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""my life is not able to be fixed,"" ""life will get better"" is called ""the most bullshit phase"") and references to unbearable pain (""the pain will all be gone"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it"" indicates planning for post-death arrangements, which can be interpreted as preparatory behavior.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no use of ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""I cannot wait to die"" shows clear ownership of suicidal thoughts, with no indication of passivity.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The funeral cost planning reinforces intent rather than rejecting it.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""); ""I cannot wait to die"" expresses a general desire without specificity.
- **Future ideation**: The desire for death is future-oriented but non-specific (e.g., no defined timing), and funeral cost planning implies forward-thinking without immediacy.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)**: Explicit intent (""I cannot wait to die"") is present. However:
  - No specific method is stated.
  - Funeral cost planning could be seen as preparation, but the framework specifies ""acquiring means, writing notes, scouting locations""—funeral arrangements are indirect and administrative, not direct evidence of actionable capability (like obtaining a method). 
  - No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is expressed.
  - → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria per irreducible rules and clarifications.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy**: Explicit wish to die (""I cannot wait to die"") is present, with no actionable plan (method) or immediacy. Funeral costs indicate serious ideation but do not elevate to behavior without method or timeline per framework boundaries.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts**: Not applicable, as explicit suicidal desire is present.

**Category Decision**: IDEATION (explicit suicidal desire without actionable plan or immediacy).

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: All content is about the writer; no mentions of others.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so no override.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy, so no behavior upgrade.
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection; intent is actively endorsed.
5. Output exactly one: IDEATION is the highest applicable category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""jump from a bridge"" (method-specific).
   - Specific method: Jumping from a bridge (with research on NYC bridges for ""highest chance of death"").
   - Preparation: Scouting locations (""which bridge""), setting deadline (""pick one by the weekend"").
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness implied (""doubt anyone will answer""), but secondary to actionable planning.
   - No past actions (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Ownership of plan (""if I were to jump,"" ""I'm gonna pick one"").
   - No disavowal or passive framing; intent is self-directed and affirmed.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Future intent with defined deadline: ""by the weekend"" (imminent, within days).
   - Present focus on planning (researching methods/locations).

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:

I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

   - Indirect death references: None. The post mentions ""I just want the pain to go away,"" which expresses a desire for relief but lacks death-related terms like ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die.""
   - Emotional markers: Distress and emotional pain are present (""I just want the pain to go away""), but no explicit hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain tied to suicide.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping, firearms).
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" ""overdosed"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses a need for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please"") and pain relief, not a desire to die.
   - Passive experience: No intrusive or unwanted suicidal thoughts described (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: Since no suicidal thoughts are expressed, there is nothing to reject. The focus is solely on seeking support and alleviating pain.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No historical references to suicide-related events.
   - Present intent: No immediate plans or timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Future ideation: No non-specific or future-oriented suicidal thoughts.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) No explicit suicide intent → Not BEHAVIOR (requires intent plus method/preparation/immediacy).
   - c) No explicit suicide desire (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.
   - d) Only distress and metaphorical pain relief (""want the pain to go away"") without actionable suicide intent → INDICATOR. The phrase ""want the pain to go away"" is a metaphor for emotional relief, not death, and aligns with the INDICATOR category's inclusion of general despair or unhappiness without active suicidal desire.

**Key Considerations from Rules**:
   - Writer-focused: Content is solely about the writer's distress.
   - Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable, as no higher-level categories (Attempt/Behavior/Ideation) are present.
   - Immediacy: No imminent timeline.
   - Rejection downgrade: Not relevant, as no suicidal thoughts are expressed.

My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" (direct statement of intent).  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""Life is miserably unfair""), worthlessness (""I never deserved anything""), and despair (""I'm sick of being epileptic..."").  
   - Past actions: Mentions self-harm via medication misuse (""Taking pain killers and antidepressants... led to my addiction... damaged my liver""), but **no explicit description of a suicide attempt** (e.g., ""tried to overdose"" is absent; actions are framed as coping, not suicide attempts).  
   - Preparations/methods: **None specified** (e.g., no pills stockpiled, no note, no location scouting).  
   - Indirect references: ""wanting to end it"" and ""shutting down"" suggest ideation.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I'm going to END IT"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts.  
   - No rejection noted: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: ""GOING TO END IT"" implies current desire.  
   - **No immediate timeline**: Lacks words like ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific deadlines.  
   - Past focus: Describes historical trauma and self-harm, but not as suicide attempts.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No described past suicide attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - b) Explicit intent (""END IT"") but **no method/preparation** and **no immediacy** → **Not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) Explicit desire (""wanting to end it"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
   - d) Distress is present but overridden by explicit suicidal desire → **Not INDICATOR**.  

**Key Clarifications**:  
- Liver damage from medication misuse is framed as a consequence of coping, not a suicide attempt (""Taking... to cope"").  
- ""END IT"" is unambiguous active ideation, but absence of method/timeline prevents escalation to BEHAVIOR.  
- Temporal hierarchy and irreducibility rules applied: No attempt/behavior overrides ideation.

I really want to fucking kill myself. Not only did I lose my boyfriend, I lost the respect of my parents and I lost my respect for them. I have no one. I was getting over my suicidal thoughts when I was with him, but now they're coming back. I'm thinking about running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I really want to fucking kill myself""  
   - Specific method/preparation: ""lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head"" (concrete plan + location)  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I have no one""), worthlessness (""lost my respect""), despair (""Fuck my life"")  
   - Self-harm reference: ""I feel like cutting myself again"" (non-suicidal intent implied by ""again,"" but suicide method is primary)  
   - **No past attempt described** (""was getting over suicidal thoughts"" implies ideation, not action)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" shows ownership of desire.  
   - **No rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present intent: Plan specifies immediate action (""running away to the train station near my house"").  
   - No future/past qualifiers (e.g., ""someday"" or ""last week"")—context implies imminence.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - → a) No described past attempt → *Proceed*  
   - → b) **Explicit intent (""kill myself"") + specific method/preparation (train tracks) → BEHAVIOR**  

**Key Considerations**:  
- ""Thinking about running away to the train station..."" constitutes preparation (scouting location).  
- ""Lay my head on the train tracks"" specifies a lethal method.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Immediacy of plan overrides general ideation (""was getting over thoughts"").  
- Self-harm mention (""cutting myself again"") is secondary to active suicide plan.  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused (ignores parents/boyfriend context).  
- No downgrade (no rejection of intent).  
- Immediacy (""train station near my house"") confirms behavior.

   - Preparations/rejections: None actively stated; rejects forced survival (""put me on a thorazine drip"") but **no disavowal of suicidal desire**.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Strong ownership (""My body, my choice means I should be able to kill myself"")  
   - No rejection: Frustration about survival (""jealous and pissed"") reinforces intent.

1. **Content Deconstruction**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""Trying to kill myself"", ""end my own life"", ""I'm going to try again"".
   - Indirect death references: None prominent; all references are direct.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Nothing in my life feels real""), worthlessness (""I'm such a fucking loser""), and shame/guilt related to suicide.
   - Specific methods: Mentions ""a different method, that's much easier and not so easy to back out of unless I go to the hospital or somehow it doesn't work bc my math is off"" – this implies a planned, calculated method (e.g., overdose or poisoning).
   - Preparations: No explicit evidence (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), but the writer discusses planning (""I'm going to try again"") and has ""plenty of opportunities"".
   - Past actions: Clear description of a past suicide attempt: ""I feel shame for failing"" and details like ""not being able to get over my own survival instincts"" indicate an aborted/interrupted attempt.

2. **Intent Analysis**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""Trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"", ""I'm going to try again"") without passivity.
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal of intent. Guilt and shame are expressed, but the writer reaffirms intent to ""try again"" without rejection (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

3. **Temporal Framework**:
   - Past focus: Dominant with a described past attempt (""failing"" and associated emotions).
   - Present intent: Current suicidal desire is evident (""I'm going to try again"").
   - Future ideation: Non-specific but imminent timing (""tomorrow maybe"", ""next week"", ""next month"", ""next year""), lacking fixed immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **Category Decision Tree**:
   - Start at a): Past suicide attempt described? Yes (""shame for failing"" and context confirm an actual attempt with suicidal intent). → **ATTEMPT** (per rule: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).
   - Since ATTEMPT is identified, it overrules concurrent elements (e.g., future ideation/behavior) due to temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation). No need to proceed to b, c, or d.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" (repeated twice).  
   - Indirect death references: None.  
   - Emotional markers: ""completely failing school,"" ""nothing I used to enjoy is fun anymore,"" ""life isn't worth it,"" ""terrified"" (about impact on family/friends).  
   - Specific methods: None mentioned.  
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no note-writing or method research beyond minimizing family impact).  
   - Past actions: None indicated (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Clear ownership (""I need to kill myself"").  
   - Passive experience/rejection: Expresses terror about consequences but **no disavowal of intent** (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). The focus is on logistics (minimizing harm), not rejecting the act.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present desire (""need to""), but **no immediate timeline** (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). Non-specific timing (implied ""at some point"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"### Analysis of User Post

**User Post:** ""I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.""

#### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I just want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I hope I don't make it"" implies a wish for death, but is tied to the context of ""another attempt.""
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (e.g., burden from parents' focus on medical bills) and worthlessness (implied by not wanting to face parents again).
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no details on means like pills or firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no evidence of acquiring means or writing notes).
- **Past actions**: Key phrase ""another attempt"" explicitly references a prior suicide attempt. ""I don't want to survive another attempt"" confirms a history of suicidal behavior with intent.

#### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: ""I just want to die"" shows direct ownership of suicidal thoughts, with no distancing language.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., not phrased as ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal (e.g., no statements like ""but I won't do it""). The desire is actively reinforced by not wanting to survive a future attempt.

#### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Dominant element—""another attempt"" clearly describes a historical suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: ""I just want to die"" expresses current desire, but it is general and not tied to a specific plan.
- **Future ideation**: ""I don't want to survive another attempt"" suggests non-specific future risk, but lacks immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or timeline).

#### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at decision tree:  
  - **a) Past suicide attempt described?** Yes, ""another attempt"" is an explicit reference to a prior suicidal action. This immediately triggers the **ATTEMPT** category per the rules (clarification: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" always → attempt).  
  - **b, c, d not reached**: The presence of a past attempt overrules concurrent elements (e.g., present ideation like ""I just want to die"") due to the temporal hierarchy (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation).

#### Irreducible Rules Verification
1. **Writer-focused**: All content centers on the writer's own experiences (e.g., ""I"" statements; no mentions of others' actions).
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Past attempt (""another attempt"") takes precedence over present ideation (""I just want to die"").
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so this rule doesn't apply.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal of suicidal thoughts; desire is active.
5. **Output exactly one category**: Attempt is the clear classification.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal thoughts"" (directly stated)
   - Indirect death references: ""death is the only escape"" (implies death as solution)
   - Emotional markers: ""too far gone,"" ""no escape,"" ""everlasting flames of life"" (extreme hopelessness)
   - Specific methods/preparations: None mentioned (e.g., pills, plans, notes)
   - Past actions: No description of prior attempts

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: ""death is the only escape"" shows acceptance of death as a solution. Ownership is clear (""my head,"" ""I wake"").
   - No rejection: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Present/future focus: Thoughts ""only getting more intense as the days pass"" and ""wake immediately with suicidal thoughts"" indicate ongoing/current ideation without specific imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - Explicit desire (""death is the only escape"") but no method/preparation/immediate timeline → **Not BEHAVIOR**

Final Classification: **ideation**  

**Key Justifications**:  
- Active suicidal desire is explicitly stated (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""death is the only escape"").  
- No evidence of specific plans, preparations, or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate to *behavior*.  
- Emotional distress (""too far gone"") supports ideation but doesn’t override explicit suicidal intent.  
- Absence of rejection language (e.g., ""but I won’t"") prevents downgrade to *indicator*.",indicator,True
269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""intention of dying""  
   - Past actions: ""I went until shortly before the point of no return"" (Event 1), ""I went in with the intention of dying... Much like the first time I stopped myself"" (Event 2)  
   - Preparations/methods: Testing a method, reaching ""point of no return""  
   - Emotional markers: ""bothered me afterwards,"" ""struggle to categorize,"" ""weighing on me""  
   - **No current ideation/plans**: Focus is retrospective; current state is ""tenuously better.""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Past ownership of intent**: Explicitly states ""intention of dying"" for Event 2.  
   - **Rejection noted**: Stopped both times due to fear/lack of courage, but this applies to past actions, not current disavowal.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Exclusively past-focused**: Both events occurred ""long enough ago,"" with no present/future intent.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**

Final Classification: **attempt**  

**Key Justifications**:  
- Event 2 meets the **Attempt** definition: Action taken with explicit intent to die (""intention of dying""), stopped at ""point of no return"" (aborted attempt).  
- Past attempts override retrospective analysis (Irreducible Rule 2).  
- No current behavior/ideation detected (all suicidal content is historical).

270,"Why exactly should I even have hope anymore? Its evident from my entire life up until now that I was never meant to be happy. I have to learn to not get my hopes up or get excited over shit. Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I really want to die"" (direct ownership).  
   - Indirect references: ""wish I knew how to kill off my emotions"" (metaphorical), ""rather die than submit"" (conditional).  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""nothing ever gets better""), worthlessness (""deserve to suffer""), isolation (""no human being is to be trusted"").  
   - **No methods/preparations**: No pills, weapons, notes, or location scouting described.  
   - **No past actions**: Mentions childhood trauma/bullying but no descriptions of prior suicide attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I really want to die"" shows direct personal desire.  
   - **No rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). Defiance (""rather die than submit"") reinforces intent but lacks actionable resolve.  
   - Intrusive thoughts not present; statements are declarative.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/focus: ""I really want to die"" reflects current state.  
   - **No immediacy**: Absence of time-bound phrases (""tonight,"" ""now""). Rhetorical ""what do I have to live for?"" implies contemplation, not urgency.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit desire (""want to die"") present → Check for method/prep/immediacy:  
     - **No specific method** (e.g., ""pills,"" ""jumping"").  
     - **No preparation** (e.g., bought means, wrote note).  
     - **No imminent timeline** (e.g., ""doing it now"").  
     → **Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria**.  
   - Explicit desire without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
   - Distress/hopelessness present but overruled by explicit suicidal desire.  

**Key Boundaries Applied**:  
- ""I really want to die"" is unambiguous active ideation.  
- ""Rather die than submit"" is conditional defiance, not behavioral intent.  
- Hopelessness/self-loathing supports but doesn’t override category rules.  
- *No downgrade*: Absence of rejection (""I don’t actually want to"") keeps it in ideation.

### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""contemplating suicide"" and explicit methods: ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself.""
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""this nightmare could all be over"" imply a desire for escape, but they are tied to explicit methods.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""destroys any hope of me getting better,"" ""mental health down a never ending pit"") and worthlessness (life described as ""a fucking hell"").
- **Specific methods**: ""Jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are concrete and actionable.
- **Preparations**: ""Looking up how to do it"" indicates active research into methods, which qualifies as preparation.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The reference to ""looking up how to do it"" is a preparatory action, not an attempt.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer expresses direct ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself,"" indicating active desire. The wish formulation (""I wish I had the courage"") implies a barrier (fear) but does not reject or disavow the intent.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive or unwanted thoughts; the language is self-directed and personal.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The lack of courage is framed as an obstacle, not a rejection of the desire.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: References past events (depression onset, COVID, scam, teachers), but suicidal behavior (""looking up how to do it"") is described in a present-school context (""6 hours of contemplating suicide"").
- **Present intent**: The contemplation and preparation are ongoing, but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") is specified.
- **Future ideation**: The wish (""i wish i had the courage"") expresses non-actionable desire at this moment, with no concrete timing.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past attempt?** No described suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted""), so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Yes: 
  - Explicit suicidal desire is present (""i wish i had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself"").
  - Specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") and preparation (""looking up how to do it"") are evident.
  - However, no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated. The preparation and specific methods meet the criteria for BEHAVIOR per the decision tree (""Explicit suicide intent + specific method/preparation"" qualifies, even without immediacy).
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as specific methods and preparation are present.
- **d) Only distress/rejected thoughts?** No, due to explicit suicidal desire and preparation.

**Category Application**:
- The presence of explicit suicidal intent, specific methods, and preparation (""looking up how to do it"") fulfills the BEHAVIOR criteria (Intent + Capability, with preparation evidence).
- The wish (""I wish I had the courage"") does not downgrade to INDICATOR per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade), as it expresses desire with a barrier (courage), not disavowal.
- No past attempt overrules (Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy), and no immediacy is needed for BEHAVIOR when method/preparation exist.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back.""  
   - Indirect death references: ""Rest In Peace"" (context: wishing for collective death).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful""), worthlessness (""I'm so fucking stupid""), despair (""life has been work, alone, disappointment"").  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past actions described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Clear ownership of distress (""I want out,"" ""I hate this""), but **no explicit suicide-specific ownership** (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"").  
   - Nuclear bomb wish (""I wish a nuclear bomb would kill us all"") is **metaphorical/collective destruction**, not a personal plan.  
   - **No rejection** of suicidal thoughts (but none are explicitly stated).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Exclusively **present-focused despair** (e.g., ""I’m so fucking done,"" ""I want out now"").  
   - **No timeline** (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") for self-harm.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - ❌ No **past attempt** described.  
   - ❌ No **explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy** (wishes for death are generalized/metaphorical).  
   - ✅ **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy**: ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out"" indicate active desire to escape life but lack actionable plan.  
   - ❌ Not *only* distress/metaphors (crosses into ideation due to active wish to cease existing).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""Want to leave and never come back"" + ""I want out"" = **active suicidal desire** (qualifies as ideation).  
- Nuclear bomb fantasy is **metaphorical**, not a personal plan (doesn’t elevate to behavior).  
- No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"") to downgrade to indicator.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"### Analysis Using the Framework

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.  
- **Indirect death references**: ""It will all be done after I die"" is an indirect reference to death, but it is contextualized by explicit suicidal content.  
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness and worthlessness are evident in ""I have so much pressure from my skin color,"" indicating distress related to racial identity.  
- **Specific methods**: ""pull the trigger"" explicitly references firearm use as a suicide method.  
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.  
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I want to die"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger,"" indicating active intent without ambiguity.  
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or unwanted (e.g., no language like ""my brain tells me"").  
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the statement ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" reinforces intent.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Past focus**: No references to past events (e.g., no mention of historical attempts).  
- **Present intent**: ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" implies immediacy, as ""just"" suggests imminent action (e.g., happening soon or now). The conditional ""if a cop doesn't do it first"" does not negate this intent but rather positions suicide as a backup plan.  
- **Future ideation**: ""It will all be done after I die"" is future-oriented but non-specific; however, it is overruled by the present intent language.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No description of a past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit suicide intent is present (""I want to die"").  
  - Specific method is stated (""pull the trigger"" for firearm).  
  - Immediacy is implied by ""I'm just going to,"" which aligns with ""immediate intent"" per framework rules (similar to ""tonight"" or ""now"").  
  - Preparation is absent, but the combination of explicit intent, specific method, and implied immediacy qualifies for BEHAVIOR.  
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as method and immediacy are present.  
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to active suicidal intent.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION**  
- **Rule 1 (Writer-focused)**: Mentions of ""cop doesn't do it first"" are about others and ignored; focus is solely on the writer's suicidal statements.  
- **Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy)**: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR (due to intent + method/immediacy) overrules IDEATION.  
- **Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps)**: ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" implies imminent action, elevating this beyond non-specific ideation.  
- **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: No rejection of suicidal thoughts; intent is affirmed.  
- **Rule 5 (Output exactly one)**: Only one category applies based on analysis.  

**Final Classification: behavior**  
- Rationale: The post expresses explicit suicidal intent (""I want to die""), a specific method (""pull the trigger""), and implied immediacy (""I'm just going to""), meeting the criteria for BEHAVIOR. The absence of preparation or a fixed timeline like ""tonight"" is mitigated by the presence of method specificity and contextual immediacy, as defined in the framework.",behavior,True

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (no phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"").  
   - Indirect death references: ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" (metaphorical).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""no one cares,"" ""tired of putting a mask""), worthlessness (""not even one word of advice""), and despair (""sleeping is really hard,"" ""tired all the time"").  
   - Specific methods/preparations: None.  
   - Past actions: ""I hurt myself two months ago"" (self-harm without confirmed suicidal intent).  
   - Preparations/immediate plans: Absent.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicide (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - Death reference is passive/metaphorical (""place where I can be free"").  
   - No explicit rejection of suicide, but no actionable desire expressed.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past: Self-harm incident two months ago.  
   - Present: Distress about relationships/work, but no current suicide plan.  
   - Future: Vague reference to death as ""freedom,"" no timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - **a) Past attempt?** ""Hurt myself"" ≠ confirmed suicide attempt (rules specify ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" with suicidal intent; self-harm alone is insufficient). → *Not ATTEMPT*.  
   - **b) Explicit intent + method/immediacy?** No explicit suicidal desire, method, or timeline. → *Not BEHAVIOR*.  
   - **c) Explicit suicide desire?** Absent (""death as freedom"" is metaphorical, not active wish to die). → *Not IDEATION*.  
   - **d) Distress/metaphors only?** Yes. Hopelessness, metaphorical death reference, and past self-harm without suicidal intent. → **INDICATOR**.  

**Key Clarifications**:  
- Past self-harm without stated suicidal intent → not ""attempt"" (requires suicidal intent).  
- ""Death seems like... freedom"" → metaphorical, not actionable ideation (rules: ""want to disappear"" → indicator).  
- Emotional distress dominates, no plan/intent.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that. I seriously think that if that were to happen the expenses from that would make me twice as suicidal and it might be too much. At the same time, this is so much to carry alone, it's been like this for seven years, and I've never told anyone. It's too much.

   - No methods, timelines, or past attempts  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active desire (""suicidal I get"", ""consider it"") but explicitly rejected (""would never do it"") due to fear of hell/consequences  
   - Preparatory journaling framed as coping, not actionable intent  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**

   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: The tone implies hopelessness or despair through the ironic framing (""Thanks to AA"" and ""Higher Power in action""), suggesting that sobriety has not alleviated suicidal thoughts, but no explicit emotional terms like ""hopeless"" or ""worthless"" are used.

- Explicit suicide references: ""attempted suicide"" (direct), ""use my suicide"" (direct).  
- Indirect death references: None.  
- Emotional markers: Anger/resentment (""hate capitalism""), but no hopelessness/worthlessness; ""existential terrorist"" suggests purpose-driven intent.  
- Specific methods: None described.  
- Preparations: None (no means, notes, or locations).

**Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- Active endorsement: ""I will use my suicide"" shows ownership of intent; no passivity or rejection.  
- Passive experience: None; thoughts are presented as deliberate.  
- Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

**Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- Past focus: ""attempted suicide 11 times"" (historical actions).  
- Present intent: ""I will use my suicide"" indicates future intent, but no immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  
- Future ideation: Suicide reference is non-specific in timing.  

**Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- Start → a) Past suicide attempt described (""attempted suicide 11 times"") → **ATTEMPT** (overrules other categories per temporal hierarchy rule).  
- b) Explicit intent (""will use my suicide"") lacks specific method/preparation or immediate timeline → does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
- c) Explicit desire present but without plan/immediacy → IDEATION possible, but overruled by past attempt.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""accomplish death"", ""shooting myself"", ""end it now"".
   - Indirect death references: ""worst fate"" (referencing failed suicide), ""body accompanied by death"".
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""no miracle is coming""), worthlessness (""I'm so bad at life""), isolation, and descriptions of unending physical/emotional pain.
   - Specific methods: Detailed discussion of firearms (shotgun vs. handgun, caliber, aiming at upper palate) and overdose.
   - Preparations: Research into methods (""I've looked into other options""), analysis of risks (paralysis from overdose).
   - Past actions: None described (mentions Mark Linkous' overdose as example, not personal history).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Direct ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death""; analysis of personal firearm use).
   - Passive experience/rejection: No disavowal of intent. Rejects specific methods due to fear of consequences (e.g., shotgun messiness, paralysis risk), but *not* the underlying desire.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Present intent: Urgent timeline (""End it now"").
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing absent; immediacy dominates.
   - Past focus: None describing personal attempts.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No described past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - b) Explicit intent (""accomplish death"", ""shooting myself"") + specific methods (firearms, overdose analysis) + immediate timeline (""End it now"") → **BEHAVIOR**  
   - c) Ideation ruled out due to presence of method specificity/immediacy.  
   - d) Indicator ruled out due to active suicidal intent.  

**Key Justifications**:  
- ""End it now"" establishes imminent timeline, triggering Behavior per rules (immediacy trumps non-specific ideation).  
- Method analysis (firearm logistics, overdose risks) confirms capability beyond abstract desire.  
- No disavowal of intent—only method feasibility concerns.  
- Writer-focused: Ignores ""End it now"" as advice to others; personal intent is clear.

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None present. No terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
- **Indirect death references**: ""never ever wake up"" is an indirect reference to death, similar to ""not wake up"" or ""be gone.""
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress and hopelessness indicated by ""Can't do any of it!"" and ""Just don't want this anymore.""
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, hanging, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or ""overdosed"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" expresses a passive desire to escape life but lacks explicit ownership of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"").
- **Passive experience**: The thoughts are presented as a wish or fantasy (e.g., ""just wanna sleep"") rather than intrusive thoughts.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The desire is stated directly without rejection.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or actions.
- **Present intent**: The distress (""Can't do any of it!"") and desire (""don't want this anymore"") are current but lack immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: ""never ever wake up"" implies a non-specific, vague future state with no concrete timeline.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** → No, as no past actions are described.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** → No explicit suicide intent (e.g., ""want to die"" is absent); ""never ever wake up"" is indirect/metaphorical. No method, preparation, or immediate timeline. → Does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live"" not present). The language is metaphorical distress. → Does not qualify for IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post shows general distress (""Can't do any of it!""), hopelessness (""don't want this anymore""), and a metaphorical death reference (""sleep and never ever wake up""). No explicit suicidal desire, plan, or rejection noted. → Qualifies for INDICATOR.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Fits as it involves distress (""Can't do any of it!""), hopelessness, and a metaphorical death reference (""never ever wake up"") without actionable suicide intent. The clarification confirms that indirect references like this, without explicit suicide context, belong here.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Only the writer's experience is described; no mentions of others.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, behavior, or ideation overrules; INDICATOR is the base level.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy present (e.g., no ""tonight"").
4. Rejection downgrade: No rejection, so no downgrade needed; the thought is direct but metaphorical.
5. Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is selected.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I want to die"" (stated twice).
- **Indirect death references**: None (phrases like ""What's the point"" imply hopelessness but are not death-specific).
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm so tired of everything,"" ""tired of pretending,"" ""tired of lying,"" ""tired of being scared"") and worthlessness (""What's the point"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting).
- **Past actions**: None (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or descriptions of past self-harm).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer explicitly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I want to die,"" indicating active desire.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., not framed as ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Ambivalence is present (""I want to die but I'm scared"") and a plea for help (""Can someone please help me work out what to do""), but no explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., not ""I don't actually want to""). The fear and request for help indicate hesitation but do not negate the active desire.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: Desire is expressed in the present (""I want to die""), but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific; no indication of when the desire might be acted upon.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Proceed.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit intent (""I want to die"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet criteria for BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes: ""I want to die"" is an explicit wish, with no actionable plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No: While distress and ambivalence are present, the explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die"") prevents downgrade to INDICATOR. Rule 4 (rejection downgrade) does not apply because there is no explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it"").

**Final Classification Rationale**:  
- The post contains explicit suicidal desire (""I want to die"") with emotional distress, but no plan, preparation, immediacy, or past attempt.  
- Ambivalence (""but I'm scared"") and a help-seeking plea do not override the active endorsement of suicidal thoughts under the framework rules. Rule 4 applies only to explicit rejection (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""), which is absent here.  
- Temporal hierarchy (Rule 2) and immediacy (Rule 3) are not triggered.  
- Output must be one category: IDEATION is the best fit based on the decision tree.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible. I feel like a drag and like people/the world would be better off without me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""ideations of suicide"", ""most days I wish I wasn't alive"".  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""nothing seems worth it""), worthlessness (""feel like a shitty person""), shame, isolation.  
   - **No** methods/preparations (""painless way"", pills, plans) or past attempts (""tried to"", ""attempted"") mentioned.  
   - **Rejection noted**: Withholds sharing ideations with therapist due to fear of consequences, but **no explicit disavowal** (e.g., ""but I won't act on it"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Passive experience: Ideations are framed as intrusive comfort (""only thing I find comfort in"") and persistent wishes (""wish I wasn't alive""), not active intent.  
   - **No ownership of immediate action**: Fear of reporting implies awareness of risk but no stated plan.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future ideation: ""Most days I wish I wasn't alive"" (non-specific timing).  
   - **No** immediate timeline (""tonight"", ""now"") or past actions beyond ideation.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

287,I'm so lonely. If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself. I don't have any friends and I'm starting to believe I never will. I'm 22. How does someone not have any friends at fucking 22? What the fuck is wrong with me?. It's been over 3 months since I had a conversation with anyone. The loneliness is so painful. I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""thinking about killing myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm starting to believe I never will"" have friends), worthlessness (""What the fuck is wrong with me?""), and unbearable pain (""The loneliness is so painful,"" ""I can't take this anymore"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of pills, hanging, jumping, firearms, or other methods.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""thinking about killing myself"" indicates ownership of suicidal thoughts, as it is presented as a direct consequence of the writer's loneliness (""If I had just one friend I wouldn't be thinking about killing myself""). There is no framing as intrusive or passive (e.g., not ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The conditional ""if"" statement explains the context but does not negate the active desire; it reinforces that the thought is present due to unmet needs.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No descriptions of past suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal thoughts are described as current (""thinking about killing myself"" and ""I can't take this anymore""), but there is no specific, immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: The suicidal thought is non-specific in timing, tied to ongoing distress rather than a concrete plan.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** Explicit suicide intent is present (""thinking about killing myself""), but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes: The explicit expression ""thinking about killing myself"" constitutes active suicidal desire, and it lacks actionable details (method, preparation) or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No: While distress (loneliness, pain) is prominent, the explicit suicide reference rules this out. The thought is not metaphorical (e.g., ""disappear"") or rejected.

**Category Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal desire without rejection.
- **Ideation**: Fits as there is explicit suicidal desire (""thinking about killing myself"") without plan, preparation, or immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Excluded due to absence of method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt**: Excluded as no past actions described.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: Only the writer's thoughts are considered; no mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or current behavior overrules ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal (e.g., ""I don't actually want to"") to downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is the clear category based on the analysis.

   - Emotional markers: ""constant anxiety and sadness,"" ""pointless situation,"" ""afraid.""

   - Preparation/action: ""frequently come close to doing it"" (repeated near-actions).  
   - No past attempt described (explicitly states ""never can"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I want [...] to stop by crashing"" shows ownership of desire.  
   - No rejection: Hesitation is due to fear of consequences (""afraid I won't die""), not disavowal of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present focus: Recurring near-actions (""frequently come close""), indicating ongoing intent.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit suicide desire (""want to stop by crashing"") + specific method (car crash) + near-actions (""come close to doing it"") → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - *Note*: Recurring near-execution with method specificity qualifies as preparatory behavior, overriding non-immediate timing (""frequently"" vs. ""tonight"").  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt → behavior prioritized over ideation.  
- No rejection phrase (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") to downgrade.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:

   - Temporal phrasing: ""Only a matter of when"" (non-specific future)  
   - No methods, preparations, or past attempts described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I'm going to kill myself"" shows ownership of intent  
   - No rejection (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future ideation: ""Only a matter of when"" implies intent but no immediacy (e.g., lacks ""tonight"")  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - Explicit intent + **no** method/preparation/immediate timeline → **Not BEHAVIOR**  
   - Explicit desire (""kill myself"") + non-specific timing → **IDEATION**  
   - No downgrade for rejection → **Not INDICATOR**  
   - *Temporal hierarchy applied*: No competing higher category  

**Key Judgment**: ""Only a matter of when"" establishes future intent but fails **immediacy threshold** (e.g., ""tonight""). Absent method/preparation, stays in IDEATION per boundary rule.

   - Emotional markers: Implied hopelessness (""not the worst outcome"").

   - **Active rejection**: Clear disavowal of action (""I won't commit"").  
   - No ownership of active suicidal desire.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - No past actions.  
   - No present/future timeline (speculative: ""if somehow"").

   - Core content: Distress + metaphors (""death is an option"") + rejected thoughts → **INDICATOR**.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- Explicit suicide reference: ""kill me""  
- Preparation evidence: ""planned this,"" ""stuff prepared""  
- Temporal marker: ""Tonight"" (immediate)  
- Ambivalent emotion: ""I wish I didn't have to"" (but overruled by commitment: ""doing the right after all"")  
- No past attempt described (""planned"" ≠ attempt)  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- Active ownership: ""Tonight is the last chance... kill me"" shows direct personal intent.  
- No rejection: ""wish I didn’t"" is counteracted by ""I wont lose the oportunity"" and ""doing the right.""  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- Dominant timeframe: Immediate (""Tonight"").  
- Past context (""a year since I planned"") is secondary to present intent.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- No past attempt → ❌ ATTEMPT  
- Explicit intent (""kill me"") + preparation (""stuff prepared"") + immediacy (""Tonight"") → ✅ BEHAVIOR  
- Ideation excluded due to presence of plan/timeline.  
- Ambivalence insufficient for downgrade (Rule 4: rejection must be explicit disavowal).  

**RULES APPLIED:**  
- Rule 2: Temporal hierarchy (immediacy elevates to behavior).  
- Rule 3: ""Tonight"" overrules non-specific timing.  
- Rule 4: ""Wish I didn’t"" ≠ rejection; intent is affirmed.

**Step 1: Content Deconstruction**
- Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" (though rejected due to self-described fear).
- Indirect death references: ""hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"" implies a desire for death, but framed through starvation.
- Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""I see no reason to fuel it with energy""), worthlessness (""I hate my body""), and self-loathing (""I look like I'm 12"").
- Specific methods: Starvation explicitly stated as a method (""stop eating all together and stave myself"" – ""stave"" interpreted as typo for ""starve"").
- Preparations: Decision to initiate starvation (""I've decided to stop eating"") indicates behavioral initiation.
- Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

**Step 2: Intent Analysis**
- Active endorsement: For starvation, the writer claims ownership (""I've decided to stop eating... and stave myself"") and expresses clear intent for death (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends""). The ""kill myself"" reference is explicitly rejected (""too much of a pussy""), but this rejection does not apply to the starvation method.
- Passive experience: No intrusive thoughts described; the starvation intent is active and deliberate.
- Rejection noted: Suicide by direct means (""kill myself"") is disavowed, but starvation is not rejected—it is presented as an alternative plan.

**Step 3: Temporal Framework**
- Past focus: None; ""I've decided"" refers to a recent decision, not past actions.
- Present intent: The decision to stop eating is current and actionable, implying ongoing behavior (e.g., initiation of starvation).
- Future ideation: Non-specific timeline for death (""hope my body breaks down slowly""), but the behavioral initiation (stopping eating) is present-focused.

**Step 4: Category Decision Tree**
- a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit suicide intent is present for starvation (desire for death via ""this just ends"") paired with a specific method (starvation) and preparation (decision to stop eating, initiating the method). No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), but the method and preparation suffice for BEHAVIOR per the framework (""specific method stated"" qualifies even without immediacy).
- c) Explicit desire exists, but it is coupled with a specific plan (starvation), so not IDEATION.
- d) Distress is present, but the active endorsement of starvation with intent rules out INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Application:**
- Writer-focused: Only the user's actions (starvation decision) are considered; ""kill myself"" rejection is noted but secondary.
- Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
- Immediacy: No explicit imminent timeline, but the specific method and preparation override this gap.
- Rejection downgrade: Rejection of ""kill myself"" downgrades that thought to INDICATOR, but the unrejected starvation plan is classified separately as BEHAVIOR.
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable category due to specific method and initiation.

   - ""Suicidal"" indicates active desire, but:
     - Desire is generalized, not actionable (""constantly"" vs. ""I want to die now"")
     - Ambivalence (sibling concern) weakens intent
     → Falls below IDEATION threshold due to lack of ownership + protective factor.
   - Primary content: Distress, hopelessness, metaphorical desire (""want a restart""), and acknowledged suicidal state without active intent → Matches INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:
- Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.

297,"Hypocritical. I have a friend from my school days that is suicidal, and I'm convinced could do it if things get bad enough. I've never been particularly close to him, and I have to fully rely on what he says to know his situation because I know very little about his life. I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him. When I started trying to convince him to keep going, I wasn't buying what I was selling, and even now that I'm mostly just there for him as a friend, I'm feeling that it's wrong to be telling him life is worth it when I don't want to keep going myself.

It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""killing myself"" and ""do it"" (referring to suicide).
   - Indirect death references: ""hope that I don't wake up"" (implies desire for death) and ""scared of the emptiness after death"" (abstract death reference).
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""It's a neverending cycle. I'm done"") and distress (""all I can do is cry myself to sleep"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, etc.).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no acquiring means or writing notes; parents have ""taken any means,"" suggesting barriers but no self-initiated prep).
   - Past actions: No description of a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Writer explicitly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""preventing me from killing myself,"" ""I could do it right now""), indicating personal desire.
   - Passive experience: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); fear is a barrier (""fear of death"" prevents action), but the desire itself is not rejected. This is a conflict, not a rejection.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: None (no references to historical attempts).
   - Present intent: ""I could do it right now"" indicates immediacy and current capability.
   - Future ideation: Not emphasized; focus is on the present conflict.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""killing myself"") + immediate timeline (""right now"") → meets BEHAVIOR criteria. Despite no specific method or preparation, the framework states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Fear as a barrier does not negate intent or immediacy for classification.
   - c) IDEATION is ruled out due to immediacy (""right now"").
   - d) INDICATOR is ruled out because explicit suicidal desire is present, and metaphors (""hope I don't wake up"") are secondary to active intent.

**Key Rule Applications**:
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/thoughts are considered (ignores parents' actions).
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
- Immediacy trumps: ""right now"" indicates imminent risk.
- Rejection downgrade: Not applicable; fear is a barrier, not a disavowal (e.g., no ""I don't actually want to"").
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I'm better off dead"" – this directly implies a wish for death, functioning similarly to ""don't deserve to live"" or ""want to die.""
   - Indirect death references: None (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""Nothing feels right,"" ""feel like a broken human being,"" ""My being in itself is a prison"") and worthlessness (""All I've done... is cause anguish and pain,"" ""Only 1 person left that cares"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, firearms, etc.).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Past actions: No mention of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The statement ""I'm better off dead"" is presented as a personal belief, indicating ownership of suicidal thoughts without ambiguity. There is no framing as intrusive or unwanted.
   - Passive experience or rejection: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me"") or explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The phrase ""Can't stand this anymore"" reinforces active distress but does not reject suicidal intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: References to past months describe causing pain to others, not suicidal behavior.
   - Present intent: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""); ""Can't stand this anymore"" expresses current distress but is non-specific.
   - Future ideation: ""I'm better off dead"" suggests a general, ongoing desire without a concrete plan or timeframe.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""I'm better off dead"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""I'm better off dead"") without plan or immediacy → IDEATION category.
   - d) Not applicable, as there is explicit suicide desire, not only distress or rejected thoughts.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:
   - Writer-focused: Only the writer's experiences are relevant; no mentions of others.
   - Temporal hierarchy: No higher category (Attempt or Behavior) overrules.
   - Immediacy: No urgent timeline to trump ideation.
   - Rejection: No disavowal to downgrade to indicator.
   - Output one category: IDEATION is the best fit.

Final Classification: The post expresses an active, owned desire to die (""I'm better off dead"") with significant emotional distress, but lacks any plan, method, preparation, or immediacy. This aligns with the IDEATION definition: ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan.""

   - **No active current intent**: Explicitly states ""made the decision to live,"" ""keep living,"" and ""light at the end of the tunnel.""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Past ownership: ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself"" shows prior active endorsement.  
   - Current rejection: ""I made the decision to live"" and ""I'll make it work"" explicitly disavow suicidal intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**

   - Present/future: Focuses on recovery (""now my situation is no longer desperate"").

   - **Rule 2 (Temporal Hierarchy)**: ""Attempt"" overrides all other categories when present.  
   - **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: Does NOT apply here because rejection refers to *current* state, while the attempt description is past-tense and concrete.  

**Key Judgment**:  
- The post documents a past aborted attempt (preparations + imminent timeline).

   - Past actions: References past suicidal thoughts (""first time I thought about it"") but explicitly states *no* action taken (""not doing it"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Ownership of thoughts: Explicit (""I've wished I wasn't alive"").  
   - Rejection noted? **No disavowal** of desire (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Regret focuses on *inaction*, not rejection of ideation.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

   - b) Explicit intent + method/prep/immediacy? **No** (no current plan/timeline).  
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan? **Yes** (""wished I wasn't alive"" is active suicidal ideation).  
   - d) Only distress/rejected thoughts? No—active desire is expressed.  

**RULES APPLICATION**:  
   - Writer-focused: Only self-references.

It sucks so much because there are times where i just get ready to die but then the administrative thought pops up.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: Present. The user states ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""wanting to die.""
- **Indirect death references**: Not prominent. Phrases like ""dead"" (e.g., ""while they're dead"") are contextual but not indirect references to death in a suicidal context.
- **Emotional markers**: Evident, including hopelessness (""I'm depressed and suicidal"") and distress (""It sucks so much"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned. No details on pills, hanging, etc.
- **Preparations**: Clearly present. The user has ""written a note"" specifying possessions for others and describes ongoing administrative preparations (""things I should cancel"" and ""get ready to die"").
- **Past actions**: The user describes a past preparation (""I have written a note"") but no actual self-harm or suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Strong presence. The user claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct statements like ""I'm depressed and suicidal,"" ""wanting to die,"" and ""think about killing myself.""
- **Passive experience**: Not observed. Thoughts are not framed as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Partial but not full disavowal. Administrative concerns ""make me not want to"" act, yet the core desire (""still wanting to die"") persists. This is ambivalence, not explicit rejection (e.g., no ""I won't do it"").

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Preparation occurred in the past (""I have written a note"").
- **Present intent**: Recurring suicidal thoughts and preparatory behaviors are described (e.g., ""everytime I think about killing myself,"" ""times where I just get ready to die""), but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing dominates (e.g., ""times where,"" ""everytime"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. Writing a note is preparation, not an attempt (no self-harm described).
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation or immediacy)?** Yes. Explicit suicidal intent is present (""suicidal,"" ""wanting to die""), and preparation is evidenced (written note). Although no specific method or immediate timeline is stated, preparation alone meets the criteria for Behavior per the framework (""Preparation evidence: wrote note"").
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as preparation exists.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to active suicidal desire and preparation.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
- Writer-focused: All content is self-referential.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, so Behavior takes precedence over Ideation.
- Immediacy trumps: No immediacy, so not a factor.
- Rejection downgrade: Partial rejection due to administrative burden, but persistent desire (""still wanting to die"") prevents downgrade to Indicator.
- Output exactly one category: Behavior is justified based on explicit intent + preparation.

**Conclusion**: The presence of explicit suicidal intent combined with concrete preparation (written note) aligns with the Behavior category, despite the lack of immediacy or method specificity. The ambivalence does not override the preparation evidence.

   - Explicit suicide reference: ""never been more suicidal in my life""  
   - Emotional markers: Distress over trespassing incident, family conflict, shame (""fucked up"")  
   - **No** methods, preparations, past actions, or indirect death references  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active ownership: ""I've never been more suicidal"" personalizes the state  
   - **No rejection** of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't act"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - ""Never been more suicidal"" implies **current intensity** but lacks timing (""tonight"") or future plans  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → a) **No** past attempt described → *Not ATTEMPT*  
   - → b) Explicit desire (""suicidal"") but **no** method/preparation/immediate timeline → *Not BEHAVIOR*  
   - → c) **Explicit suicide desire** (""suicidal"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**  
   - → d) Rejected? No → *Not downgraded to INDICATOR*  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Suicidal"" is explicit ideation per category definitions.  
- ""In my life"" denotes severity but **not** imminence (rules 2-3).  
- No method/preparation/timeline prevents escalation to BEHAVIOR.  
- No rejection phrases (rule 4) prevent downgrade to INDICATOR.

My family doesn't love me, my friends just put up with me, I get mocked by people I barely know online, it just hurts so much. I just want someone to like me, anybody. I'm nobodies first choice or even second choice, nobody seems to think about me at all. I feel so alone in the world, and I'm soon going to go to college, where I will no absolutely nobody. Its seems so terrifying. I just want to die and go to Heaven and be with Jesus. Thats what I want more than anything else.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I just want to die"" (direct expression of suicidal desire).  
- **Indirect death references**: ""go to Heaven"" (implies death as a desired outcome).  
- **Emotional markers**: Profound hopelessness (""I feel so alone""), worthlessness (""nobody seems to think about me""), and despair (""it just hurts so much"").  
- **Methods/preparations/past actions**: None specified.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Ownership of desire (""I just want to die and go to Heaven... That's what I want more than anything"").  
- **Passive experience/rejection**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). Desire is actively claimed.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Future ideation**: References to college (""soon going to go"") frame suffering as ongoing, but suicide desire lacks timing cues (e.g., ""tonight"").  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- No past attempt → Rules out **ATTEMPT**.  
- Explicit desire (""want to die"") present, BUT:  
  - No method/preparation (""go to Heaven"" is abstract, not actionable).  
  - No immediacy (""soon"" refers to college, not suicide).  
  → Does **NOT** meet **BEHAVIOR** criteria.  
- Explicit desire with no plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
- Distress/hopelessness present, but explicit suicidal desire overrules → Not **INDICATOR**.  

**Key Boundary Checks**:  
- ""Want to die"" is explicit ideation (not metaphorical).  
- ""Go to Heaven"" is religious framing but doesn’t negate suicidal intent.  
- No downgrade due to rejection (writer affirms desire).

I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: Writer states *""I'm suicidal myself""* (direct ownership).  
- **Indirect references**: None from the writer. (All other suicide references describe the *friend's* actions: ""multiple suicide attempts,"" ""body hanging,"" etc.)  
- **Emotional markers**: Writer expresses helplessness (""I don't know how,"" ""I’m scared,"" ""confused"") but no self-focused hopelessness/worthlessness.  
- **Methods/preparations**: None described for the writer.  
- **Past actions**: No self-attempts described by the writer.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: *""I'm suicidal myself""* implies personal struggle but lacks actionable desire (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
- **Passive experience/rejection**: No elaboration or disavowal of the writer’s own suicidal thoughts.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- Writer’s suicidal reference is present-tense but *non-specific*: No timeline, method, or plan.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- **a)** No described past attempt → *not ATTEMPT*.  
- **b)** No explicit intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → *not BEHAVIOR*.  
- **c)** ""I'm suicidal myself"" suggests desire but lacks plan/immediacy → *IDEATION?*  
- **d)** **Key nuance**: The phrase *""I'm suicidal myself""* is isolated and generalized. It lacks:  
  - Explicit wish to die (e.g., ""I want to die"")  
  - Context of intent, method, or timeline  
  - *Clarification boundary*: General statements like this without actionable intent → **INDICATOR** (per ""Distress without actionable suicide intent"" definition).  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLIED**  
- **Rule 1 (Writer-focused)**: Ignore all friend-related suicide content.  
- **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: N/A (no disavowal, but no escalation either).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill me"" and ""end my life"" are direct and unambiguous expressions of suicidal desire.
   - Indirect death references: None present; all references are explicit.
   - Emotional markers: High distress is evident through ""Please!"", ""I beg you"", and ""end my pain"", indicating hopelessness and unbearable suffering.
   - Specific methods: No methods (e.g., pills, firearms) are mentioned.
   - Preparations: No evidence of planning, acquiring means, or writing notes.
   - Past actions: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer directly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""kill me"" and ""end my life"", showing personal desire for death.
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the language is assertive and pleading.
   - Rejection noted: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); the plea is unresisted.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Absent; no historical references.
   - Present intent: The urgency (""Please!"", ""Just"", ""I beg you"") suggests a current desire for immediate relief, but no explicit timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"") is stated.
   - Future ideation: No non-specific timing (e.g., ""someday""); the focus is on the present moment.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent is present (""kill me"", ""end my life""), but no specific method/preparation and no explicit immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""want to die"" equivalent) without plan or immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
   - d) Not applicable, as explicit suicidal desire is present, and there are no rejected thoughts or metaphors alone.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
- Writer-focused: Ignored the plea for others to act; focused on the writer's expressed desire for death.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrides.
- Immediacy: Urgency implied but not explicit (e.g., no ""tonight""), so it does not trump.
- Rejection: None present; no downgrade to indicator.
- Output one category: IDEATION fits best.

I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I wish I could die"", ""curl up and die"" (repeated passive expressions).  
- **Indirect death references**: None beyond the above.  
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""feel like a failure""), worthlessness (""I am a failure""), emotional pain (yelling parents, anxiety/depression).  
- **Specific methods/preparations**: None mentioned (no pills, weapons, notes, locations).  
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: Desires are passive (""wish I could die"") and conditional (""when they yell..."").  
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit protective factors (""I would worry about [my dogs] if I died""; love for parents; future plans like graduation). No ownership of active intent.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- **a)** No past attempt described → *Not ATTEMPT*.

316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""wanting to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal desire.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress is evident, including ""disgusted,"" ""hateful towards myself,"" ""ugly I felt,"" and ""terrible feeling,"" indicating hopelessness and worthlessness.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or details on how self-harm would occur.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of a suicide attempt (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). The phrase ""I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself"" describes a sexual act involving suicidal ideation, not a suicidal action.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself,"" indicating active desire.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" phrasing).
- **Rejection noted?**: The writer expresses distress about the thought (""I just wanted to get it out of my head"") and regret (""Terrible feeling""), but there is no explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The focus is on unwanted feelings rather than rejecting the desire itself.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: The suicidal ideation is described in the recent past (""recently I just felt disgusted... I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself"").
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No future-oriented statements about suicide; the desire is non-specific and anchored in past experiences.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No evidence of a described attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or actions with suicidal intent). → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit suicidal desire (""wanting to kill myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes, ""wanting to kill myself"" constitutes active suicidal desire, with no actionable plan or immediacy. → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: Distress is present, but it is accompanied by explicit suicidal desire, not solely metaphors or rejected thoughts. The lack of explicit disavowal (e.g., ""I don't actually want to"") prevents downgrade to INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis is centered on the writer's own experiences (e.g., ""I"" statements), ignoring relationship issues.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt described, so hierarchy doesn't override.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so not BEHAVIOR.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Distress and wanting the thought ""out of my head"" imply discomfort, but no explicit disavowal of intent (e.g., ""I don't actually want to die""), so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: IDEATION is the best fit.

Conclusion: The post expresses explicit suicidal desire without a plan, preparation, or immediacy, fitting the IDEATION category.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Unequivocal active ownership: ""I will... end my life"" (direct first-person claim)  
   - No rejection or disavowal (defends suicide as rational choice)  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future-oriented: ""when I end my life"" (no immediate timeline)  
   - Explicit immediacy absent (ends with ""going to bed"" after rant)

   - No active endorsement of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - ""Worth it"" implies hopelessness, not suicidal ownership.  
   - Rejection noted? N/A (no suicidal thoughts presented).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past focus: Self-harm incident ""a few months ago.""  
   - Present/future: Non-specific hopelessness (""some day's"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) Past suicide attempt? **No** (self-harm ≠ suicide attempt without intent).  
   - b) Explicit intent + plan/immediacy? **Absent**.  
   - c) Explicit suicidal desire? **None**.  
   - d) Distress/hopelessness dominates → **INDICATOR**.  
   - *Key nuance*: Self-harm history and scars indicate severe distress but lack suicidal intent per descriptions. ""Worth it"" is passive hopelessness, not ideation.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart. I also worry I just shouldn't have a job teaching kids if I'm still cycling like this and prone to psychotic symptoms (I have visual hallucinations and occasionally delusions). Anyone got any ideas?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: The post contains ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts,"" which are direct references to suicide.
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
   - Emotional markers: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""one hell of a depressive spell,"" ""spiraling worse""), worthlessness (feeling unsupported by family), and distress due to lost coping mechanisms.
   - Specific methods: No mention of any methods (e.g., pills, hanging).
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The focus is on seeking help (hospital) rather than acting on thoughts.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" regarding self-harm). Mentions of ""tried reaching out"" refer to seeking support, not suicide-related actions.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer acknowledges suicidal thoughts (""suicidal ideation,"" ""act on my suicidal thoughts""), but this is not presented as a current intention. Instead, there is explicit rejection: ""I'd rather... go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"" and ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point.""
   - Passive experience: Thoughts are not framed as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: Clear disavowal with statements prioritizing help-seeking over action, indicating the thoughts are not being acted upon.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Describes historical context (e.g., bipolar symptoms for 7 years, past coping methods, recent job changes), but no past suicide attempts.
   - Present intent: No immediate plans for suicide; instead, present focus is on barriers to care (insurance, job) and resisting action (""I don't think I'm a danger to myself"").
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing for suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""that can change"" refers to potential future risk, but no concrete timeline like ""tonight""). The primary concern is waiting until February 1st for insurance.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → NOT ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide desire is present, but no specific method/preparation or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or method details) → NOT BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""suicidal ideation"") exists, but it is paired with rejection (""I'd rather go to the hospital""), and there is no plan/immediacy → However, rejection triggers downgrade per Rule 4.
   - d) Distress and rejected thoughts are dominant, with no actionable suicide intent → INDICATOR.
   - Conclusion: The rejection of suicidal action (""I'd rather go to the hospital"") and absence of plan/immediacy align with INDICATOR per the downgrade rule (Irreducible Rule 4).

   - Preparations: Daily heroin use (could be interpreted as self-harm but framed as coping, not explicit suicide prep).  
   - **Absent**: Specific suicide methods, active preparation (e.g., buying pills for overdose), past attempts, or rejected thoughts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Passive experience: Death wishes are framed as outcomes (""I will be finally dead"") rather than active intent (""I will kill myself"").  
   - No explicit ownership of suicidal action (e.g., ""I’ll overdose""). Primary focus is anger at others and fear of institutionalization.  
   - Heroin use is contextualized as response to distress, not a stated suicide method.

- Temporal/immediacy: ""Soon"" is non-specific.  
- Rejection: N/A (no suicidal thoughts disavowed, but no active suicidal claims either).

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""killing myself"" is a direct and explicit suicide reference.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""I don't know what the fuck to do anymore""), worthlessness (""I still feel like trash""), and despair (""I'm sick of life"") are evident.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any method (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership with ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""Let's just do it,"" indicating active personal intent.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The language shows commitment to acting.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No reference to past events (e.g., no ""last week I tried"").
- **Present intent**: ""Let's just do it"" implies an impulsive, immediate call to action, suggesting current intent. However, no explicit timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing is present in ""my only way out,"" but ""Let's just do it"" introduces urgency, leaning toward immediacy.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** 
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""killing myself"" and ""my only way out"").
  - Specific method/preparation: No.
  - Immediate timeline: ""Let's just do it"" expresses immediate intent (similar to ""end it tonight"" in spirit), qualifying under the rule: ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details."" → Meets criteria for BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable due to the immediacy in ""Let's just do it.""
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, due to explicit suicide intent and lack of rejection.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/intent are considered.
- Temporal hierarchy: Not triggered (no past attempt).
- Immediacy trumps: ""Let's just do it"" implies immediacy, overriding non-specific ideation.
- Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.
- Output exactly one category: BEHAVIOR.

**Conclusion**: The post contains explicit suicidal intent with an expression of immediate action (""Let's just do it""), meeting BEHAVIOR criteria despite the absence of specific methods or preparations.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: 
  - ""I'm going to attempt again"" (direct reference to planned suicide action).
  - ""I want to die"" (explicit expression of suicidal desire).
  - ""I've tried to overdose three times"" (explicit description of past suicide actions).
  - ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"" (additional explicit past action).
- **Indirect death references**: 
  - ""Goodbye"" (implies departure or ending, but in context, it reinforces suicidal intent).
  - ""not want to live in [this body] anymore"" (indirect rejection of life).
- **Emotional markers**: 
  - Hopelessness: ""I give up,"" ""I am not fighting anymore,"" ""my body has lost the fight and my mind has won.""
  - Worthlessness: ""I hate every little thing about myself,"" ""don't understand how people can love somebody like me.""
  - Unbearable pain: ""I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired,"" ""tears, the pain, the loneliness.""
- **Specific methods**: 
  - Overdose (mentioned in past attempts: ""tried to overdose three times"").
  - No specific method stated for the upcoming ""attempt again,"" only implied by past actions.
- **Preparations**: 
  - None explicitly described for the upcoming attempt (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: 
  - Clear past suicide attempts: ""tried to overdose three times"" and ""my first attempt at the beginning of this year"" (both with suicidal intent).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts and plans with direct statements like ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""I give up."" There is no indication these thoughts are passive or intrusive; they are presented as deliberate and self-driven.
- **Passive experience**: Not present; the language is assertive and personal (e.g., no phrases like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts. The writer questions others' perspectives (""does that really matter if I don't love myself"") but reinforces personal intent with ""I don't want to get better"" and ""I choose not to get better."" This confirms active endorsement without downgrade.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Dominant with detailed descriptions of historical suicide attempts (""tried to overdose three times,"" ""first attempt"").
- **Present intent**: Imminent plan indicated by ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again"" (suggesting action within hours) and ""Goodbye"" (implying immediate departure).
- **Future ideation**: Minimal; the imminent timeline (""just a few more hours"") overshadows any non-specific future references.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start at decision tree entry point:
  - **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → **YES** (""tried to overdose three times"" and ""first attempt"" are explicit descriptions of past concrete actions with suicidal intent). This triggers the **ATTEMPT** category per the tree's first branch.
  - Since past attempt is described, the decision tree terminates here (per temporal hierarchy rule: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation). Concurrent elements (e.g., present intent with ""just a few more hours"") are overruled by the mention of past attempts, as defined in the category clarifications ("" 'tried to' or 'attempted' always → attempt"" and ""Attempt overrules concurrent ideation/behavior when mentioned"").

### Irreducible Rules Verification
1. **Writer-focused**: All analyzed content centers on the writer's own actions and feelings (e.g., ""I've tried,"" ""I want to die""). Mentions of others (e.g., family reactions) are ignored.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Past attempt (ATTEMPT) takes precedence over present behavior (e.g., ""I'm going to attempt again"" with immediacy) and ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: Present intent (""just a few more hours"") would typically elevate risk to BEHAVIOR, but it is overruled by the explicit mention of past attempts.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable; no disavowal of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it"").
5. **Output exactly one category**: Only 'attempt' is applicable based on the above.

I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal desire (""planning on killing myself"") but framed conditionally on future feelings.  
   - Explicit rejection of immediate action: Emphasizes years to reconsider/seek help.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Exclusively future-focused: ""at 30 or 25,"" ""in 8 yrs,"" no present/past intent or actions.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - ❌ No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - ❌ Explicit intent + distant timeline (not immediate) + no method/prep → Not **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - ✅ Explicit desire (""want to die"" equivalent) with conditional future timing → **IDEATION**.  
   - ❌ Not downgraded to **INDICATOR** (rejection applies to *immediate* action, not core desire).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""Planning"" implies desire but distant timeline (""25/30 yo,"" ""8 yrs"") and lack of specificity in method/preparation exclude **Behavior**.  
- Conditional language (""if I still feel the same"") reflects ambivalence but doesn’t negate active ideation.  
- *Rule applied*: ""Ideation"" requires active desire without plan/immediacy—criteria met.

332,"Three Days Changes Everything. I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. It started with an old trigger, then every little problem, every panic attack I had learned to power through, ended with my harming. I swore to my family I could stop, I swore to the love of my life I would stop, I told myself I would stop. Now after four months I'm self harming again. What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements like ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time."" These are clear expressions of suicidal intent.
- **Indirect death references**: None present; all references are explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness is evident in phrases like ""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly,"" reflecting despair and a sense of inevitability. Worthlessness is implied through the relapse narrative and self-blame (""I swore... I would stop"").
- **Specific methods**: No method is specified for suicide (e.g., pills, hanging). Self-harm (""bloodying myself up"") is mentioned, but self-harm is not equivalent to a suicide method unless explicitly linked to intent to die—here, it is described separately from the suicidal statements.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of suicide-specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). The self-harm is occurring (""I'm bloodying myself up now""), but it is not framed as preparation for suicide.
- **Past actions**: The post describes past self-harm (""I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend""), but self-harm is distinct from a suicide attempt. No phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" refer to suicide; the focus is on self-harm relapse.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims direct ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now,"" indicating active, personal intent. There is no presentation of these thoughts as intrusive or unwanted.
- **Passive experience**: Not applicable; the thoughts are not described as involuntary.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal intent (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the writer escalates the intent with ""I should do it now.""

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Relates to self-harm history (""four months without... until this weekend""), but no past suicide attempt is described.
- **Present intent**: The statement ""I should do it now"" indicates immediate suicidal intent. The phrase ""I'm bloodying myself up now"" shows current self-harm, but this is concurrent with, not equivalent to, suicidal behavior.
- **Future ideation**: ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" suggests non-specific future risk, but this is overruled by the immediacy of ""now.""

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start at the decision tree:
  - a) **Past suicide attempt described?** → No. The post only references self-harm, not a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" for suicide). Self-harm alone does not qualify as an attempt under the framework.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)** → Yes. Explicit intent is present (""kill myself""), and there is an immediate timeline (""now""). Even though no specific method or preparation is mentioned, the framework states: ""Expressions of immediate intent ('end it tonight') qualify even without method details."" Here, ""now"" is an expression of immediate intent, so this meets the criteria for BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy** → Not applicable because immediacy (""now"") is present.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts** → Not applicable due to explicit, unrejected suicidal intent.

### Irreducible Rules Application:
1. **Writer-focused**: The analysis focuses solely on the writer's actions and intent (e.g., ""I kill myself"").
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt, so behavior takes precedence over ideation due to immediacy.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: ""now"" indicates imminent intent, overriding non-specific future ideation.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of suicidal thoughts; intent is affirmed.
5. **Output exactly one category**: BEHAVIOR is the clear classification.

Final Classification: The post expresses explicit suicidal intent with immediacy (""now""), qualifying as BEHAVIOR despite the lack of method details. Self-harm is noted but does not alter the category, as it is not explicitly tied to suicide preparation or intent in this context.

I always see people who fucking cheat and mercilessly get bashed for it. i fucking deserve death, im tired if these stupidass ignorant people. please kill me before i hurt someone and i still have a conscience.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""someone blow my head off"" (direct method reference to firearms), ""please kill me"" (direct request for death), ""i fucking deserve death"" (explicit desire for death).
- **Indirect death references**: ""im fucking done"" (metaphorical, but implies ending life), ""before i hurt someone"" (suggests death as a solution).
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people""), worthlessness (""i always fucking wonder what people would think if they saw the real fucking me"", ""i fucking deserve death""), and guilt/fear of causing harm (""before i hurt someone"").
- **Specific methods**: ""blow my head off"" specifies firearm use.
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting).
- **Past actions**: No references to past attempts (e.g., ""tried"" or ""attempted"" is absent).

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct, first-person statements (""someone blow my head off"", ""please kill me"", ""i fucking deserve death""). No distancing language.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; all expressions are active and self-directed.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). The plea ""please kill me"" reinforces active desire.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: None (no descriptions of historical actions).
- **Present intent**: High immediacy implied by urgent language (""im fucking done"", ""please kill me before i hurt someone""), suggesting a desire for immediate action.
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific timing (e.g., ""someday""); the tone is current and pressing.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past attempt?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: 
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""blow my head off"", ""please kill me"", ""deserve death"").
  - Specific method: Yes (""blow my head off"" is a concrete firearm reference).
  - Preparation: No.
  - Immediacy: Yes (urgent plea ""please kill me"" and ""before i hurt someone"" implies imminent timeline, similar to ""tonight"" per rules).
  - → Meets criteria for BEHAVIOR (intent + capability via specific method, plus immediacy).
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?**: Not applicable, as method and immediacy are present.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: Not applicable, due to explicit suicide intent and method.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: All content is self-referential; no mentions of others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: Urgent language (""please kill me before"") overrides any non-specific elements.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection; active endorsement confirms intent.
5. **Single output**: BEHAVIOR is the clear category.

- Specific timeline: ""right now""

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago.

   - No rejection: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""); regret is about failure (""a failure once again""), not about changing intent.

- Despite current suicidal planning (method specificity, preparations) and conflicted intent, **past attempt disclosures always override concurrent indicators** per framework rules.  
- ""I really do not want to do this"" reflects ambivalence but **not rejection** (Rule 4); it coexists with active intent to overcome barriers (""how do I stay on the tracks?"").",ideation,True

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (""die,"" ""kill myself,"" etc. absent)  
   - Indirect death references: None (""disappear,"" ""be gone,"" etc. absent)  
   - Emotional markers: **Hopelessness/worthlessness** (""burden,"" isolation/joblessness)  
   - Methods/preparations: **None**  
   - Past actions: **None**  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die"")  
   - No intrusive thoughts or disavowals  
   - Sole focus: **Descriptions of distress and life circumstances**  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Exclusively **present-focused** (current state of isolation/inactivity)  
   - No past/future suicidal references  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → No past attempt (a)  
   - → No explicit intent + no method/prep/immediacy (b)  
   - → No suicidal desire (c)  
   - → **ONLY distress** (burden, isolation) → **INDICATOR**  

**Key Observations**:  
- ""Burden"" suggests worthlessness (emotional marker), but **lacks actionable suicidal intent**.  
- Isolation/unemployment = distress signals, not suicide planning.  
- Strictly adheres to INDICATOR definition: distress without suicidal desire, methods, or timeline.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""end it all"" (x2), ""kill myself"", ""commit lifen't"" (euphemism), ""end it all"" (repeated), ""end it"".

   - Preparations: ""looking into my options"", ""getting my ducks in a row"" (organizing plans), ""make my decision"".  
   - Rejection noted: ""possibility I'll opt not to go through with it"" (conditional/hypothetical rejection).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Dominates the text (""I'm finally free to end it all"", ""free to get cracking"").  
   - **Rejection context**: The disclaimer is tentative (""possibility"") and framed as secondary to preparatory actions.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - ❌ No past attempt → Not **Attempt**.  
   - ✅ Explicit intent (""end it all"") + Preparation (""getting ducks in row"") → **Behavior** (per rule: ""Preparation evidence"" triggers Behavior).  
   - Conditional rejection (""opt not to go through"") is insufficient to downgrade (Irreducible Rule 4 requires *explicit* disavowal; here, it's speculative).  
   - Temporal note: ""once I'm ready"" implies planning but lacks *immediacy* (e.g., ""tonight""). However, **preparation alone satisfies Behavior criteria**.  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Preparation phrases (""getting my ducks in a row"") demonstrate actionable steps beyond passive ideation, overriding the non-immediate timeline.  
- Hopelessness and relief reinforce intent but are secondary to concrete behavioral indicators.

The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**

   - Emotional markers: ""Lonely,"" ""feel like an inconvenience,"" ""don't fit in,"" ""coward"" (worthlessness/hopelessness).  
   - Specific methods: ""knife to my wrist"" (cutting).  
   - Preparations/past actions: **""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x... couldn't cut""** (aborted attempts).  
   - Death imagery: ""imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood.""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: **""I feel like I just need to do it""** (ownership of intent).  
   - Rejection noted? No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: Bullying history, **aborted attempts (""3x in my life"")**.  
   - Present/future: Current desire (""need to do it"") but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start with **a) Past suicide attempt described?** → **YES** (""had a knife to my wrist 3x"").

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""Had a knife to my wrist"" + inability to cut = **interrupted attempt** (qualifies as Attempt under rules).  
- ""Imagine my family seeing me dead"" = visualization, but Attempt supersedes concurrent ideation.

If I told you everything I have been through and everything I have done to others, is there any hope of still being loved despite it? I would like to feel that before I kill myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""before I kill myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no terms like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong themes of hopelessness (""is there any hope of still being loved despite it?""), worthlessness (""I am not entirely a good person""), and distress (""I have done fucked up stuff"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""before I kill myself"" claims ownership of suicidal thoughts, framing it as a conditional future action based on unmet emotional needs (""I would like to feel that before I kill myself""). There is no indication of passive or intrusive thoughts.
- **Passive experience**: Not applicable; thoughts are presented as self-generated.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"" or similar rejection). The suicidal intent is not dismissed.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicidal actions; mentions of past behavior (""done fucked up stuff"") are contextual to guilt/shame, not suicide attempts.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""); the phrase ""before I kill myself"" implies a non-specific future contingency.
- **Future ideation**: Suicidal intent is future-oriented and conditional on not achieving love/acceptance, but lacks specificity in timing.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No evidence of a described attempt → Rule out ""attempt"".
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet criteria for ""behavior"".
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes: Explicit wish to die (""kill myself"") is stated, but it lacks actionable details (method, preparation) or immediacy. Conditional phrasing (""before I kill myself"") does not imply an active plan, aligning with non-actionable ideation.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No: While distress and hopelessness are evident, the explicit suicide reference (""kill myself"") prevents this from being ""indicator"".

**Category Alignment**: Matches ""ideation"" due to active suicidal desire without plan or immediacy. The conditional nature (""before I kill myself"") does not constitute rejection (which would downgrade to indicator) but rather reinforces desire under circumstances. Per temporal rules, no immediacy (""tonight"") to elevate to behavior.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. Writer-focused: Content centers on the user's own feelings and intent; no external references.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior overrules, as none present.
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediate timeline to override ideation.
4. Rejection downgrade: No disavowal of intent; suicidal thought is not rejected.
5. Output one category: Confirmed.

   - No rejection language (e.g., ""but I won’t""), but no active desire expressed either.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit suicide reference exists (""thought of suicide""), but:  
     - No specific method/preparation.  
     - No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  
     - → Does **not** meet BEHAVIOR criteria.  
   - Explicit suicide desire? Phrasing (""thought of suicide"") shows awareness, not active wish (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - Core is distress + metaphorical hopelessness (""can't fix that shit"") → INDICATOR.  
   - **Irreducible Rule #4**: Lack of active intent (""thought of"" vs. ""I will"") supports downgrade.

   - No active suicidal wish (e.g., ""I don’t deserve to live"") → Not IDEATION.  
   - **Falls into INDICATOR**: Metaphorical death references (""like a cat... go into some dark corner""), distress, hopelessness, and passive acceptance of death **without actionable intent**.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
   - ""My time is coming to an end"" without explicit suicide context → Indicator (per definition).

It's currently 6 in the morning here in the UK and I'm about to lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills . I'm a 19 year old male university student studying architecture and planning . I've suffered from depression, severe anxiety and social anxiety for quite a few years , but have never been diagnosed or seeked help or spoken to anyone about this . I had a mental breakdown in spring 2019 just before my A levels but somehow managed to get back on my feet and complete my exams and no one knows , it was such a painful time . Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year . But I feel so horrible and fake , I act so normal and put a front around everyone not knowing how I've fucked everything up pretending everything is still okay , I have high functioning depression so ive learned to hide all of this really well . perfectionism paralyses me into trying to be good and act without fault around everyone  all the time . All of this is too overwhelming now. I can't bear the thought of having to retake a year and end up been behind all my friends let alone the shame and overwhelming thoughts about them and family finding out and also what the future holds . This has been the last straw for me and suicide is on my mind . I feel awful because I don't want to do this but I've run out of options . Furthermore my brothers and my 20th birthday is only in a couple of days , which adds to the pain .

   - Past context: Mentions past mental health struggles but **no described suicide attempt** (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" is absent).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I'm ready to do it"" and ""about to lock myself in the bathroom"" show ownership of intent.  
   - Rejection noted: ""I don’t want to do this"" expresses reluctance, but it is overruled by active planning (""run out of options"").

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method,"" which are direct references to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""no interest in modern life,"" ""each year has got worse,"" ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"").
- **Specific methods**: Mentions ""contemplate method"" but no details (e.g., pills, hanging), so methods are non-specific.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer personally owns the thoughts (""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round,"" ""I probably contemplate method""), indicating active engagement without framing them as external or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as unwanted intrusions (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The concern expressed (""what's really worrying"") does not constitute rejection.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Describes worsening depression over years but no past suicide attempts.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal thoughts are current (""constantly,"" ""contemplate method over 100 times a day""), but no specific plan or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Contemplation is ongoing and non-specific in timing (e.g., ""constantly"" rather than ""someday"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?**: Explicit intent is present (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplate method""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes—explicit suicidal desire with non-actionable method contemplation and no immediacy → IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No—explicit suicidal desire is present, so not INDICATOR.

### Category Definitions Alignment
- **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit suicidal desire.
- **Ideation**: Fits—active suicidal desire (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""contemplate method"") without actionable plan or immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Excluded—no specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt**: Excluded—no past actions described.

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis is on the writer's own experiences; no irrelevant mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt, so hierarchy not invoked.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No terms like ""tonight"" to elevate to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of thoughts, so no downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: One category selected based on analysis.

So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me).

Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: The post contains a direct reference to suicide: ""When to know if suicide is better.""
   - Indirect death references: Phrases like ""the release"" imply death or escape metaphorically, but are not explicit.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness is evident (e.g., ""all I have is that,"" ""life is a bust,"" descriptions of chronic trauma, OCD, anhedonia, isolation, and abuse since childhood).
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no details on pills, hanging, etc.).
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts or self-harm actions (e.g., no use of ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or similar language).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer questions suicide (""When to know if suicide is better"") and implies personal relevance by seeking shared experiences (""anyone else feels like the release is better""). This suggests ownership of suicidal thoughts but frames them as contemplative rather than declarative (e.g., not ""I want to die"").
   - Passive experience: No indication of thoughts being described as intrusive or external (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The post is exploratory, seeking validation, but does not dismiss the idea.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Describes historical suffering (""lived for years with trauma... since I was 12 or 13"") but no past suicide attempts.
   - Present intent: No indication of current plans, immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), or actionable steps.
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing (e.g., ""When to know if suicide is better"") and references to an upcoming milestone (""I'm 20 soon"") without tying it to suicide plans.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) Past suicide attempt? No → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy? Explicit suicide reference (""suicide is better"") indicates desire, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"") → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? Yes: The post expresses an explicit consideration of suicide as preferable (""suicide is better"") and a personal sense that ""the release is better,"" which aligns with an active wish to die (e.g., equivalent to ""want to die"" in context). No plan or immediacy → IDEATION.
   - d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? No, because the explicit suicide reference and implied desire go beyond general distress or metaphors (e.g., ""suicide"" is literal, not metaphorical like ""disappear"").

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK**:
- Writer-focused: The post centers on the writer's own experiences and thoughts; no mention of others.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt or behavior elements, so IDEATION stands.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""wanna go sleep forever"" (common metaphor for death).

   - Preparations: Possession of specific, quantified means (pills).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I wanna go sleep forever"" shows direct ownership of suicidal desire.  
   - No rejection noted: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: ""can't take this shit no more"" implies current crisis, though no explicit timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt described → Not ""Attempt"".  
   - Explicit suicide desire (""wanna go sleep forever"") + specific method/preparation (quantified pills in possession) → **BEHAVIOR** per Rule 2 (specific method) and Rule 3 (implicit capability via possession).  
   - Despite no immediate timeline word (e.g., ""tonight""), method specificity overrides per framework: ""Specific method stated"" qualifies for Behavior even without temporal immediacy.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- Pill quantities indicate capability (Irreducible Rule 2: capability = Behavior).  
- ""Sleep forever"" is metaphorical but contextually suicidal given medication details.  
- No downgrade (Rule 4) due to lack of rejection.

   - **No** indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions  
   - Burden perception: ""not fair to people to have to deal with me""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:

361,I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I don't want to bail out anymore. I tried with a knife. It didn't work. I can't do it. I have a rope. I never checked out the place. There's a building but I don't want to traumatize anyone. What do I do? I have to do it. I should've done it a long time ago. I hate myself so much. I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I have to do it"" (implies ending life), ""I should've done it a long time ago"" (refers to suicide), and ""I want this to end"" (context suggests ending life).
- **Indirect death references**: None prominent; all references are direct or contextually clear.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""I hate myself so much""), worthlessness (implied in self-hatred), and unbearable pain (""I want this to end"").
- **Specific methods**: ""knife"" (past attempt) and ""rope"" (current possession).
- **Preparations**: ""I have a rope"" (acquiring means), but ""I never checked out the place"" (negated scouting of location). No evidence of writing notes.
- **Past actions**: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times"" and ""I tried with a knife. It didn't work"" explicitly describe past suicide attempts (interrupted/aborted actions with suicidal intent).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I have to do it"", ""I should've done it"", ""I don't want to bail out anymore""), indicating personal intent.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Ambivalence is present (""I am scared"", ""I don't want to traumatize anyone""), but no explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""I won't do it""). Fear does not constitute rejection; intent remains endorsed.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Clear descriptions of past attempts (""tried and bailed out multiple times"", ""tried with a knife"").
- **Present intent**: ""I have to do it"" and ""I don't want to bail out anymore"" indicate current suicidal desire, but no specific imminent timeline (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing (""I have to do it"" implies urgency but lacks concrete planning).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Any past suicide attempt described?** → YES (""tried with a knife"" and ""bailed out multiple times"" qualify as past attempts, including interrupted/aborted actions). This triggers **ATTEMPT** category per rules.
  - Since past attempt is present, the decision tree stops here. Per irreducible rules:
    - Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation): Attempt overrules concurrent ideation/behavior (e.g., current desire ""I have to do it"" or possession of rope).
    - Rule 1 (Writer-focused): All content is self-referential; no distractions from others.
    - Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): Ambivalence (""I am scared"") does not negate the past attempt, so no downgrade to indicator.
- Final category is **ATTEMPT**, as descriptions of past self-harm with suicidal intent always take precedence.

362,"Tired of it. No point to anything in life with depression. I feel pain and i just want to end it. Im honestly just so useless I have to be the most useless pos known to mankind. A fly is worth more than i am. all they do is look for food and reproduce, i cant even do that. im useless.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""i just want to end it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, equivalent to ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" in this context.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""No point to anything in life with depression""), worthlessness (""I have to be the most useless pos,"" ""A fly is worth more than i am,"" ""im useless""), and emotional pain (""I feel pain"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no terms like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""i just want to end it"" demonstrates clear ownership of suicidal thoughts, framed as a personal desire (""I want"").
- **Passive experience**: No indication that thoughts are intrusive or external (e.g., no language like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). The post expresses unresisted intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal desire is expressed in the present tense (""i just want to end it""), but there is no specific, immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: The desire is current but non-specific regarding timing (e.g., no words indicating when it might occur).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start here →
  - a) **Past attempt described?** No mention of a past suicide attempt → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** Explicit intent (""want to end it"") is present, but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes, explicit desire to die (""want to end it"") is stated, but with no actionable plan, preparation, or imminent timing → Matches IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, because explicit suicidal desire is present, and there are no rejected thoughts or purely metaphorical references (e.g., ""end it"" is actionable, not metaphorical like ""disappear""). Distress alone is insufficient here.

### Category Alignment
- **Indicator**: Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts.
- **Ideation**: Fits perfectly—active suicidal desire (""want to end it"") without plan or immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Not applicable, as no method, preparation, or imminent timeline is present.
- **Attempt**: Not applicable, as no past actions are described.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis is solely on the writer's own thoughts; no mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or current behavior overrules, so IDEATION stands.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to elevate to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection (e.g., ""I don't actually want to"") to downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is the clear category.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: None directly stated (e.g., no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Indirect death references: ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (equivalent to ""not wake up"").
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""tired of being alone,"" ""Christmas probably won't be happening,"" ""depressed enough"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned.
   - Preparations: None described.
   - Past actions: ""attempt properly again"" clearly references a past suicide attempt (phrased as ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The phrase ""hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" expresses a passive desire for death, but it is immediately countered by ""But I will, as always,"" which reduces its urgency. The future-oriented statement ""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" indicates conditional suicidal desire but lacks current ownership.
   - Passive experience: No explicit description of intrusive thoughts.
   - Rejection noted: ""But I will, as always"" serves as an explicit disavowal of the wish not to wake up, downgrading the intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Dominates with ""attempt properly again"" describing a historical suicide attempt.
   - Present intent: No evidence of current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: ""Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"" suggests non-specific future risk, but it is contingent on events and not actionable.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start → a) Any past suicide attempt described? Yes, ""attempt properly again"" directly references a past attempt. This triggers the **ATTEMPT** category per the decision tree rule (past attempt described → ATTEMPT) and irreducible rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy: Attempt > Behavior > Ideation). The conditional future ideation (""attempt properly again"") does not override this, as attempt takes precedence. The disavowal (""But I will, as always"") and indirect references are secondary due to the hierarchy.

   - Explicit suicide references: ""looking for someone to kill me"", ""hide my body""  
   - Indirect death references: ""chop me up"", ""never get found again"" (implies death)  
   - Emotional markers: None explicitly stated, but implied hopelessness (desire to disappear permanently)  
   - Specific methods: Homicide by proxy (""someone to kill me""), dismemberment (""chop me up"")  
   - Preparations: Actively soliciting an accomplice to commit the act and conceal evidence  
   - Past actions: None described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Direct ownership (""I am looking for someone to kill me"") with no rejection.  
   - Passive experience/Rejection: Absent. No disavowal of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present intent: Solicitation implies immediate action is sought (no future/past qualifiers).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - b) Explicit suicide intent + specific method (proxy homicide/dismemberment) + active preparation (seeking accomplice) → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c/d) Not applicable due to presence of plan/preparation.  

**Key Verifications**:  
- Writer-focused: All self-referential (""me"", ""my body"", ""I am"").  
- Temporal Hierarchy: Preparation (solicitation) overrides non-immediate ideation.  
- Rejection: None present (""happy for u to chop me up"" confirms endorsement).  
- Immediacy: Solicitation implies urgency for action.

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: ""I consider it"" suggests brief consideration BUT...

   - Rejection noted: ""I just can't harm myself"", ""I don't know why, but I just can't""  
   - **No** methods, preparations, past attempts, or specific timelines  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active desire: ""wish to end my life"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""commit suicide"" (general statement, not self-referential).
   - Indirect death references: None (phrases like ""snap and break down"" imply distress but not death).
   - Emotional markers: Distress themes present (""bottled everything up"", ""painful emotions"", ""break down"") but generalized (""people"", ""we"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned.
   - Preparations: None described.
   - Past actions: No personal attempt described (""tried to deal with emotions"" refers to coping, not suicide).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - No active endorsement of personal suicidal desire (uses ""people"" and ""we"" abstractly).
   - No passive experience of intrusive thoughts (discusses societal patterns).
   - No rejection of personal thoughts (post is observational, not self-reflective).

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Entirely general/phenomenological (""most of the time"", ""one day"").
   - No past/present/future personal timeline.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt → Rule out ATTEMPT.
   - b) No explicit personal intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → Rule out BEHAVIOR.
   - c) No explicit personal desire to die → Rule out IDEATION.
   - d) Only general distress, metaphors (""break down""), and non-actionable references → INDICATOR.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION**:

- Temporal hierarchy: No personal timeline.
- Immediacy: Absent.
- Rejection: N/A (no expressed personal ideation to reject).

372,If I kill myself Im giving nobody nothing. fuck everyone  I knew. I dont owe anybody shit whether they wanted to help me or not. I just wanna leave a giant middle finger before I leave this world forever and people will know I aint having any of their shit. I dont owe anybody anything and if they have a problem with that too bad because I'd  be dead.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""If I kill myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: ""leave this world forever"" implies death but is contextualized by the explicit reference, so it reinforces rather than stands alone.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of anger, resentment, and defiance (""fuck everyone,"" ""I dont owe anybody shit,"" ""giant middle finger""), but no explicit hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain. The focus is on relational conflict and a desire to make a statement.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any method (e.g., pills, firearms, jumping).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""If I kill myself"") and frames it as a personal choice to reject others. There is no indication these are passive or intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Passive experience**: Not applicable; thoughts are presented as deliberate and self-directed.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal or rejection of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the post rationalizes the possibility of suicide as a defiant act.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now,"" ""right now""). The language is conditional (""If"") and future-oriented without specificity.
- **Future ideation**: The post centers on non-specific timing (""before I leave this world forever""), implying a potential future action without concrete plans.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** Explicit intent is present (""If I kill myself""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes: The core of the post expresses an active wish to die (""I kill myself,"" ""I just wanna leave"") with no actionable details. The conditional ""if"" does not negate desire but lacks plan or urgency.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No: While there is distress (anger), the explicit suicidal desire rules this out. No metaphors (e.g., ""disappear"") or rejection of thoughts.

### Category Alignment
- **Indicator**: Excluded because the post contains explicit suicidal desire, not just distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts.
- **Ideation**: Fits perfectly—explicit suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) without method, preparation, or immediacy. The anger/defiance does not override this.
- **Behavior**: Not met—no method, preparation, or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
- **Attempt**: Not applicable—no past actions described.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: The post is entirely about the writer's own thoughts and intentions; no mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt, behavior, or immediacy, so ideation stands.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of suicidal thoughts; instead, they are endorsed.
5. **Output exactly one**: Ideation is the clear category.

Conclusion: The post expresses active suicidal ideation with no plan, preparation, or immediacy, falling squarely under IDEATION.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (no ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" etc.)  
   - Indirect death references: ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" (framed as passive future outcome, not active intent)  
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""can't function,"" ""constant dread,"" ""no connection""), worthlessness (""can't motivate myself""), isolation  
   - Methods/preparations: **None described**  
   - Past actions: **No mention of attempts or self-harm**  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - ""Dead"" is presented as a **prediction** (""I see myself..."") not an active desire.  
   - No ownership of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - Rejection implied: Focuses on external causes (""motivation has to come from external"") rather than endorsing self-harm.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - ""Dead"" references **5-year future** – distant/non-specific.  
   - All distress descriptions are present-focused but **lack urgency** (e.g., no ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - b) No explicit intent + no method/prep/immediacy → **Not BEHAVIOR**  
   - c) No explicit active desire (e.g., ""want to die"") → **Not IDEATION**  
   - d) **INDICATOR confirmed**:  
     * Metaphorical death reference (""Dead"" as future state)  
     * Pervasive hopelessness/isolation  
     * No actionable suicidal intent or planning  
     * Rejection implicit in externalizing blame (""no opportunities came to me"")  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- ""Dead"" is downgraded to indicator per Rule 4 (passive prediction + no suicide context).  
- Temporal hierarchy irrelevant (no higher-risk elements).

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""kill their self"" is an explicit suicide reference.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: The post references ""to end their pain,"" indicating distress or hopelessness, but this is framed hypothetically about ""someone"" else.
- **Specific methods**: No methods described (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of planning or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer does not claim ownership of suicidal thoughts. The post uses hypothetical language (""if someone wants to kill their self"") and focuses on others, not the writer. The phrase ""Asking for a personal reason"" suggests personal relevance but does not translate to active personal endorsement of suicidal desire.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts presented as involuntary (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). However, the query is framed as a general question, not a personal statement of intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events or attempts by the writer.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific or specific future suicidal ideation expressed by the writer. The post is hypothetical and question-based.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) No past suicide attempt described by the writer → NOT ATTEMPT.
  - b) No explicit suicide intent from the writer + no specific method/preparation or immediate timeline → NOT BEHAVIOR.
  - c) No explicit personal suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") → NOT IDEATION.
  - d) The post contains distress (""end their pain"") and metaphorical/hypothetical suicide references (""kill their self"") but no actionable personal intent. The focus on others and lack of writer-owned suicidal expression aligns with INDICATOR. The ""personal reason"" note implies distress but does not escalate to ideation without explicit desire.

### Key Considerations from Irreducible Rules
- **Rule 1 (Writer-focused)**: The suicidal reference (""kill their self"") is about ""someone"" else, not the writer. This must be ignored for classification. Only the writer's expressions matter, and here there are no personal suicidal statements.
- **Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy)**: Not applicable, as no temporal elements from the writer exist.
- **Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps)**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to override.
- **Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade)**: No explicit rejection of thoughts, but the hypothetical framing prevents escalation to higher categories.
- **Rule 5 (Output exactly one)**: Only INDICATOR fits, as the post shows general distress and engagement with suicide themes without personal intent.

I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal"", ""suicide by a train"", ""kill me""  
   - Past actions: ""I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning"" (childhood attempt)  
   - Specific method: ""suicide by a train"", ""put neck on the train tracks""  
   - Preparation/timeline: ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" (future date)  
   - Emotional markers: ""depressed"", ""waking up everyday faking everything""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of past attempt (""I thought jumping in and drowning"") and current/future intent (""suicide is on my mind"", ""planning on doing it"").  
   - No rejection of thoughts (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past**: Childhood drowning attempt (""when I was 10 or 11"").  
   - **Present**: Daily suicidal ideation (""every hour... suicide by a train is on my mind"").  
   - **Future**: Plan for 18th birthday (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start → **a) Past suicide attempt described?** YES (""I run to the lake... thought jumping in and drowning... she convinced me not to""). This directly triggers **ATTEMPT** per rules.  
   - *Irreducible Rule #2*: ""Attempt"" overrides concurrent ideation/behavior. Even with present ideation (""suicide... on my mind"") and future plans (""planning on doing it""), the explicit description of a past attempt (""tried to"" narrative) is the highest-priority category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None. Uses ""suicidal thoughts"" but frames them historically.  
   - Indirect death references: None. ""End his life"" refers to another person (excluded by Rule 1).  
   - Emotional markers: Distress (""rougher weeks""), unwanted thoughts (""don't want to think like this"").  
   - Methods/preparations/past actions: **None**. References others' actions (excluded) and personal historical thoughts (""behind me"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement?** No. Explicitly rejects thoughts: ""I just don’t want to think like this anymore.""  
   - **Passive experience?** Yes. Describes intrusive thoughts (""keep thinking about it"") triggered externally.  
   - **Rejection?** Explicit: ""don’t want to think like this"" → downgrades to indicator.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""just want my life to end"" (equivalent to ""not want to live"").  
   - Emotional markers: ""depressive episodes,"" ""rage outbursts,"" inability to function.  
   - **Absence**: No methods, preparations, past attempts, or timelines.  
   - Key nuance: Thoughts are explicitly labeled **""intrusive thoughts""** and framed as involuntary (""constantly compulsions"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Ownership: Thoughts are presented as **unwanted intrusions** (""intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions""), not actively endorsed desires.  
   - Rejection: While not explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""), the framing as *compulsive/intrusive* implies lack of active intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - No past actions, specific plans, or timelines. Focus is on **ongoing distress** without immediacy.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**

378,"not sure what to call this-. i don't know how to describe it, but it feels like i disassociate sometimes. granted, it could just be adhd stuff along with a part of my extreme dysphoria and never feeling like i'm the person i appear as; but, it doesn't feel like i'm in my body. like i'm simply watching someone work and live while i only watch. when others call for me or start conversations, it's like i'm not a part of it. i can't fully think when i talk or write, like i act without my own permission. i feel so disconnected from life in itself already, to the point where my emotions never act how i want. even when it came to serious topics such as my dog's passing or nearly killing myself one night, i don't feel really anything for it. i just sit there and watch people express themselves, not knowing what to do. when i see others sad or stressed, i can't feel the same or help. everything seems so far out of my touch, like it's not even real at some times. i can write things down or do something earlier that day, only to feel as if it were fake or like i wasn't actually doing it/there. this doesn't held that i lucid dream so often that, when i wake back up, real life feels more as a dream than my actual dreams. i zone out fairly often to the point of not realizing where i am or what i was doing prior. i want to talk to a therapist about it, but i have no money nor insurance to talk to one. not like i'd even trust a therapist fully with how trashy past ones have treated me. and i've already caused enough trouble for my parents. all i can do is watch days pass by without me even realizing it. dealing with constant bad moods from my dad, to the point where he throws things at times, and barely seeing my mom as she works. it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking. maybe then i could finally feel like i'm in control of myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a direct reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: ""step off a building or over a bridge"" implies suicidal methods indirectly.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""everything seems so far out of my touch""), worthlessness (""i've already caused enough trouble for my parents""), and emotional numbness (""i don't feel really anything for it"").
- **Specific methods**: ""step off a building or over a bridge"" specifies jumping as a method.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a past event with suicidal intent, indicating an aborted or interrupted attempt (per framework clarification: ""interrupted/aborted attempts"" qualify as attempts).
- **Other notes**: Mentions disassociation, distress, and barriers to help (e.g., lack of therapy access), but these are contextual, not primary to suicide risk classification.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""it'll only take one day where i step off a building or over a bridge without thinking"" shows active consideration of suicide, framed as impulsive but self-owned. No passive language (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive; the suicidal ideation is integrated into the narrative.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The desire for therapy (""i want to talk to a therapist"") implies help-seeking but does not reject suicidal thoughts outright.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: ""nearly killing myself one night"" is a clear past event with suicidal intent.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: ""it'll only take one day"" expresses non-specific future timing, not immediacy.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start at decision tree:
  - **a) Any past suicide attempt described?** → Yes, ""nearly killing myself one night"" qualifies as an interrupted/aborted attempt per framework rules (always classified as 'attempt' when ""tried to"" or similar language is used). This triggers the 'attempt' category.
  - Since 'attempt' is identified, the temporal hierarchy rule (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation) applies, overriding other elements. The future ideation (""step off a building"") does not change this, as past attempt takes precedence.
- No rejection or downgrade factors apply (e.g., no disavowal like ""I don't actually want to"").

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION
1. **Writer-focused**: All references are to the writer's own experiences.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Past attempt ('attempt') overrules future ideation ('behavior' or 'ideation').
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (""tonight"") to elevate ideation to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: None present.
5. **Output exactly one category**: 'attempt' is selected.

### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""i want to take myself out"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, equivalent to ""kill myself"" or ""end my life,"" indicating an explicit reference.
- **Indirect death references**: General expressions of distress like ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""i need a way out,"" and ""i just need it to stop"" imply a desire to escape but are not specific to death.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""not worth it anymore,"" ""too much happening,"" ""i don't want to deal with it""), worthlessness (""all i ever do is disappoint and burden other people""), and isolation (""i just can't go to anyone"") are present.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of concrete methods (e.g., pills, hanging). The reference to fear of pain (""i'm scared it'll be painful"") suggests consideration of methods but lacks specificity.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no use of ""tried,"" ""attempted,"" or similar language).

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""i want to take myself out"" demonstrates active ownership of suicidal thoughts, with no indication these are passive or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as unwanted intrusions (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: The qualifier ""but i'm scared it'll be painful"" expresses fear and hesitation but is not an explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""I won't do it"" or ""I don't actually want to""). The plea for help (""what do i do, please?"") suggests ambivalence but does not reject the desire itself.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to historical suicide-related events.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal desire is expressed in the present (""i want to take myself out""), but there is no indication of an immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: The desire is current but non-specific in timing, aligning with general ideation rather than imminent action.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past attempt?** No description of a past attempt → not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal intent (""i want to take myself out"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") → does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal desire is present (""i want to take myself out""), with no actionable plan, method specificity, or immediacy. Fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") indicates a barrier but does not constitute a plan or preparation → matches IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Explicit suicidal desire rules this out; distress and metaphors (e.g., ""way out"") are present but secondary to the active suicidal wish → not INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: All content centers on the user; no mentions of others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or current behavior overrules the ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") to escalate to behavior.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Hesitation due to fear of pain is not explicit rejection (e.g., ""but I won't do it""), so no downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is the appropriate category.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses active suicidal desire without evidence of a specific plan, preparation, or imminent timeline. Fear and distress are present but do not negate the explicit ideation.

381,"I am still young. I'm 16 years old. Quarantine has killed my mental health, it is has to get out of my bedroom on the daily and my family calls me lazy. It's a reoccurring problem now. I work 8 hours on the weekends and I like to sleep afterwords, just a nap right? Who doesn't like an after work nap? Well, apparently my family because as of today I am the most useless person alive. My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations. That's why for the past 6+ months I have been thinking on how to die painlessly, but I have yet to find a way. It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die""  
   - Indirect death references: ""how to die painlessly"", ""when I'm gone""  
   - Emotional markers: ""feeling like a coward"", ""useless"", ""burnout"", ""tired of expectations""  
   - Methods: ""die painlessly"" (non-specific)  
   - Preparations: None described  
   - Past actions: None (mentions ""contemplating"" but no actual attempt)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Explicitly states ""I want to die"" and details 6+ months of suicidal ideation.  
   - Passive/rejected thoughts: Expresses ambivalence (""scared of consequences of failure""), but **no disavowal** of intent (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Past: Ideation ongoing for ""6+ months""  
   - Present/Future: Non-specific timing (""have yet to find a way"")  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit intent (""want to die"") + method/preparation/timeline? Method is vague (""painlessly""), no preparations, no immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") → **Not BEHAVIOR**.  
   - Explicit desire (""want to die"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
   - Distress/metaphors present, but active suicidal desire overrules → Not INDICATOR.  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Want to die"" is explicit suicidal desire.  
- Vague method (""painlessly"") and lack of timeline/preparation exclude BEHAVIOR.  
- Fear of failure shows ambivalence but doesn’t negate active ideation (rejection rule requires explicit disavowal, e.g., ""but I won’t do it"").

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**
- **Active endorsement**: Ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I've only thought about killing myself"") and implied intent (""before I do it"").
- **No disavowal**: Absence of rejection (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
- **Present intent**: Preparation (emails) implies imminent action (""before I do it"").

**Key Judgments:**  
- ""before I do it"" contextualizes emails as suicide preparation.  
- Preparation evidence triggers BEHAVIOR per rules (""Critical expansion"").

I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

1. **Content Deconstruction**:
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""finally considering suicide"".
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore""), worthlessness (""feel so pathetic""), overwhelm (""it's so hard""), and isolation (""friends have all left me"").
   - No indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions described. Mentions of ""we all die"" are philosophical, not suicidal.

2. **Intent Analysis**:
   - Active endorsement: ""finally considering suicide"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts.
   - No rejection noted: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). The line ""I honestly wouldn’t give a shit if it weren’t for my parents"" implies ambivalence, not rejection.

3. **Temporal Framework**:
   - Present focus: ""finally considering suicide"" (current ideation). References to exams (""Thursday"") indicate near-future stress but no imminent timeline for self-harm (e.g., no ""tonight"").

4. **Category Decision Tree**:
   - a) No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) Explicit intent (""considering suicide"") but lacks:  
     - Specific method/preparation (e.g., no pills, note).  
     - Immediacy (e.g., no ""now,"" ""tonight"").  
     → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) Explicit suicidal desire (""considering suicide"") without plan/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.  
   - d) Distress/metaphors present but overruled by active suicidal ideation.

**Key Boundaries Applied**:  
- ""Considering suicide"" = active desire (upgrades from distress).  
- No imminent timeline/method → Stays IDEATION (not BEHAVIOR).  
- Writer-focused: Ignores ""we all die"" as generalization.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt/behavior overrides.

What am I doing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""almost committed"".
- **Indirect death references**: ""ready to leave everything"" (implies departure from life).
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness (""Living life as a shell is bullshit""), worthlessness (""I'm too much of a pussy even kill myself""), and unbearable pain (""the worst feeling the worst suspense I ever felt"").
- **Specific methods**: Cutting (""my wrists and thighs are bleeding"", ""knife"").
- **Preparations**: Evidence of readiness (""I was ready"", ""about to do"", bleeding indicates initiation of action).
- **Past actions**: Direct description of an attempt (""I just attempted to end my life"", ""I almost committed"", self-harm with bleeding, and aborted action: ""put down my knife"").

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts and actions (""I attempted"", ""I was ready"", ""I almost committed"").
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; all expressions are self-directed and active.
- **Rejection noted**: After the attempt, there is disavowal (""I'm too much of a pussy even kill myself"", ""I put down my knife""), but this occurs post-attempt and does not negate the prior suicidal action.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: The entire post describes a recent, concrete action (""I just attempted"", ""I was right there about to do"", ""I put down my knife"").
- **Present intent**: No current plan or immediacy expressed; the writer is reflecting on the past event and expressing distress (e.g., ""I'm shaking and bawling"", ""What am I doing"").
- **Future ideation**: Absent; no mention of future plans or non-specific timing.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start with rule (a): **Any past suicide attempt described?** → Yes, the writer explicitly states ""I just attempted to end my life"" and describes self-harm with bleeding, an aborted action (""put down my knife""), and near-completion (""I almost committed""). This meets the definition of **Attempt** (past concrete action with suicidal intent, including interrupted/aborted attempts).
- Rules (b), (c), and (d) are not applicable due to the **temporal hierarchy** (Attempt > Behavior > Ideation): The described attempt overrules concurrent elements like emotional distress or rejected thoughts post-event.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  1. **Writer-focused**: Only the writer's actions are relevant (no mentions of others).
  2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Attempt takes precedence over behavior (e.g., specific method) or ideation.
  3. **Immediacy trumps**: Not applicable, as immediacy (""tonight"") is absent in present context.
  4. **Rejection downgrade**: Post-attempt disavoul does not downgrade the category because the attempt already occurred.
  5. **Output exactly one**: Attempt is the highest applicable category.

Final Classification: **attempt** (based on direct description of past self-harm with suicidal intent, including aborted action).

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
- **Explicit suicide references**:  
  - ""I feel like killing myself"" (direct ownership)  
  - ""if I had the guts to kill myself I would"" (explicit desire)  
- **Indirect death references**: None beyond metaphorical distress (e.g., ""dead end"").  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""no point to life""), worthlessness (""see my worth""), and relational pain (""people hurt me too much"").  
- **Specific methods/preparations**: None described (e.g., no pills, notes, locations).  
- **Past actions**: Explicitly denies attempts: ""I’ve **never actually attempted** suicide despite wanting to"".  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: Clear ownership of desire (""I would [kill myself] if I had the guts"").  
- **Rejection noted**: Self-corrects capability (""but I don’t [have the guts]""), downgrading immediacy. No disavowal of desire itself.  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Past**: Historical ideation (""wanting to"" die) but no attempts.  
- **Present/Future**: Non-specific timing (""I would"" implies conditional future action). No urgent markers (e.g., ""tonight"").  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
- a) **Attempt?** → No (""never actually attempted"").  
- b) **Behavior?** → Requires intent + (method/prep OR immediacy). *Intent is present, but no method/prep AND no imminent timeline* → **No**.  
- c) **Ideation?** → Explicit desire (""want to kill myself"") without plan/immediacy → **Yes**.  
- d) **Indicator?** → Rejected thoughts? Partial (""don’t have guts"" addresses capability, not desire). *Desire remains active* → **No**.  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
- Writer-focused: All suicidal references are self-referential.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt/behavior overrides.  
- Rejection: Capability rejection (""don’t have guts"") doesn’t negate desire → insufficient for downgrade to indicator.

The school called and said I can be considered a truant but luckily I saw the voicemail first and deleted it. And just for anyone whose confused I can't do that class. My fat ass of a guidance councillor was too busy eating chips to check her email and pull me out of the college level class early on. What's the point of attending or trying when I'm going to fail? I got a fifty last term and the only way to pass is to get a 80 this term. That's impossible. Plus I only have a week left.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""ending my life tonight"", ""killing myself is the only escape""
   - Specific method: ""slit my wrists with some scissors""
   - Preparations: ""written my suicide note"", ""put it on my notes app"", ""delete everything""
   - Emotional markers: hopelessness (""what's the point""), worthlessness (""coward""), perceived inevitability (""only escape"")
   - No past attempts described

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Ownership of intent (""I'm ending,"" ""I'll find a way,"" ""Killing myself"")
   - No rejection: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"")

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

392,"""friend"" snitched on me and told family my plan to kill myself. now they're keeping their heads up and watching me. this is like preventing someone to get euthanized. what the fuck.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
- Explicit suicide references: ""my plan to kill myself"" is a direct and explicit reference to suicide.
- Indirect death references: ""preventing someone to get euthanized"" is a metaphorical/comparative reference to death, but it is not self-referential in a suicidal context (euthanasia is externally imposed, not self-initiated).
- Emotional markers: Anger and frustration (""friend snitched,"" ""what the fuck"") and a sense of being controlled (""they're keeping their heads up and watching me"") are present, but no explicit hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain is described.
- Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no details on pills, hanging, etc.).
- Preparations: ""My plan to kill myself"" implies some level of planning, but no specific evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations is provided.
- Past actions: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**
- Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""my plan to kill myself,"" presenting it as a personal intention rather than an intrusive thought.
- Passive experience: No indication of thoughts being intrusive or unwanted (e.g., no language like ""my brain tells me"").
- Rejection noted: No disavowal or rejection of suicidal intent (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the comparison to euthanasia and anger at prevention suggests endorsement of the plan.

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
- Past focus: No reference to past actions or attempts.
- Present intent: The phrase ""now they're watching me"" indicates current monitoring due to the revealed plan, but it does not specify that the plan is active or imminent (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"" for the suicide act).
- Future ideation: ""My plan to kill myself"" suggests future-oriented suicidal thinking, but no specific or immediate timeline is provided.

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
- a) Past suicide attempt described? → No, so not ""attempt.""
- b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)? → Explicit intent is present (""my plan to kill myself""), but there is no specific method (e.g., pills, firearms), no evidence of preparation (e.g., acquired means), and no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). Thus, does not meet criteria for ""behavior.""
- c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? → Yes, explicit desire (""plan to kill myself"") is stated, but the plan is vague and non-actionable (no details on method or timing), and no immediacy is indicated. Fits ""ideation.""
- d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? → Not applicable, as there is explicit suicidal desire.

**Category Alignment:**
- **Indicator**: Does not apply because there is explicit suicidal desire (""plan to kill myself""), not just distress or metaphors. The euthanasia reference is metaphorical but contextualized within active suicidal intent.
- **Ideation**: Matches, as there is an explicit wish to die (""plan to kill myself"") without evidence of specific method, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Behavior**: Not met, as no specific method, preparation evidence, or immediate intent (e.g., ""tonight"") is expressed.
- **Attempt**: Not met, as no past actions are described.

**Irreducible Rules Check:**
- Writer-focused: Only the writer's actions/intent are considered; mentions of others (friend, family) are ignored.
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt > behavior > ideation conflict; ideation is the highest applicable.
- Immediacy trumps: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to override.
- Rejection downgrade: No rejection of intent; intent is actively endorsed.
- Output one category: Ideation is selected.

393,Im gonna minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks. I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children and then im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now. I hope my baby ends up safe,2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""im gonna kill myself"" is a direct and explicit statement of suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Implied hopelessness (e.g., isolation plan, concern for baby's safety) but no explicit descriptors like ""hopeless"" or ""worthless.""
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: Describes behavioral preparation: ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks"" and ""I won't reach out or foster conversations with anyone except children,"" indicating social withdrawal in anticipation of suicide. However, this does not align with the framework's examples of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes, scouting locations), as isolation is a general behavioral change rather than concrete evidence.
- **Past actions**: No references to past attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The statement ""im gonna kill myself"" shows clear ownership of suicidal thoughts, with no indication of passivity (e.g., not framed as intrusive thoughts).
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal or rejection (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). The plan is affirmed.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: None.
- **Present intent**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Specific future timeline: ""3 weeks from now"" indicates a defined but non-imminent plan.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""im gonna kill myself"").  
  - Specific method: No.  
  - Preparation evidence: Social withdrawal described, but it does not match framework examples (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes). Thus, not considered preparation evidence.  
  - Immediate timeline: ""3 weeks from now"" is specific but not imminent (per framework: ""imminent"" means ""tonight,"" ""right now,"" or ""this weekend"").  
  → Conditions for BEHAVIOR not met.  
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**  
  - Explicit desire: Yes.  
  - No actionable plan: Timeline is specific but non-imminent, and no method/preparation evidence.  
  → Meets criteria for IDEATION.  
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, due to explicit suicide desire → Not INDICATOR.

### Key Considerations from Rules
- **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt or behavior overrules, so IDEATION stands.  
- **Immediacy trumps**: ""3 weeks from now"" is not immediate, so does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.  
- **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection present.  
- **Writer-focused**: Mentions only the writer's actions (e.g., ""I won't reach out,"" ""im gonna kill myself"").  
- **Output exactly one category**: IDEATION is the highest applicable category based on explicit desire without actionable plan or immediacy.

   - Preparation evidence: Itemizes acquired means (""3 bottles,"" ""30 pills,"" ""bottle"").  
   - No emotional markers, past actions, or rejection noted.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Ownership implied through self-referential question (""kill *me*"").  
   - No disavowal or framing as intrusive thoughts.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present focus: ""Would this"" implies imminent consideration of using substances *now*.

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family.

She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None found. The post contains no direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
- **Indirect death references**: None found. There are no allusions to death, dying, or not existing (e.g., ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" ""painless way to die"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong evidence of hopelessness and worthlessness. Examples include: ""I'm a complete lost cause,"" ""nothing I do can change it,"" ""constantly stuck,"" ""I've never had any skills that are useful to anyone,"" ""I'm a constant burden,"" ""I'll never be able to help,"" ""any attempts I've made to fix this have failed miserably,"" ""will never happen,"" ""I'm a lost cause,"" and ""always going to fail."" No expressions of unbearable physical or emotional pain are present.
- **Specific methods**: None identified. No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging, jumping, firearms).
- **Preparations**: None detected. No references to acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations for suicide.
- **Past actions**: No description of suicide attempts. The phrase ""attempts I've made"" refers to life efforts like job applications or driving lessons, not self-harm. No terms like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" in a suicidal context.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses despair and self-criticism but never states a desire to die or engage in self-harm.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described (e.g., no phrases like ""my brain tells me to die"").
- **Rejection noted**: No suicidal thoughts to reject or disavow, as the content lacks any suicide-related ideation.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: The post references historical events (e.g., ""since I got back from uni,"" failed job applications, driving lessons), but these are life struggles, not suicide-related.
- **Present intent**: No current suicidal plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"" in a suicidal context).
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""someday I might die by suicide"").

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- Start at the decision tree:
  - a) **Past suicide attempt described?** → No, so not ""attempt.""
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation or immediate timeline)?** → No explicit suicide intent, so not ""behavior.""
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die""), so not ""ideation.""
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post contains distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) without any suicidal desire, metaphors, or context. Falls under ""indicator"" as per the definition: ""General unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" with ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire.""

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis considers only the writer's expressions; no mentions of others' actions in a suicidal context.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Not applicable, as no higher-level categories (attempt, behavior, ideation) are present.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: Not triggered, as no imminent timeline.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts to reject.
5. **Output exactly one category**: ""Indicator"" is the best fit based on the absence of suicidal content and presence of distress.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - No explicit suicide references (e.g., ""die,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - No indirect death references (e.g., ""be gone,"" ""not wake up"").  
   - Emotional markers: ""feel like shit,"" ""depressed,"" ""sad,"" ""alone"" (distress/hopelessness).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Seeks connection (""talk to someone,"" ""feel less alone"") to cope with distress.  
   - No ownership of suicidal thoughts; focuses on alleviating sadness.  
   - No rejection of suicidal ideation (as none is present).

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None found. Phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: Present. ""non existence after death"" is mentioned, and ""I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this"" implies a desire to cease living, though not explicitly suicidal.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong evidence of hopelessness (""light has disappeared,"" ""system doesn't work,"" ""no results to speak of,"" ""can't continue""), worthlessness (""made me feel like a completely worthless person""), and unbearable pain (""end of my rope,"" ""wits end,"" ""severe anxiety"").
- **Specific methods**: None identified. No mention of pills, hanging, etc.
- **Preparations**: Clear evidence. ""I wrote a note today"" directly indicates suicide note preparation.
- **Past actions**: No suicide attempt described. The ER/hospital visit resulted from help-seeking (""reached out for help last night"") and is framed as a system failure, not self-harm. Terms like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" are absent.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: Suicidal intent is implied but not explicitly claimed (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""I cant keep going like this"" and ""non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me"" suggest passive ownership of thoughts about death as an escape.
- **Passive experience**: Not prominent; thoughts are not described as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Seeking help (""last chance at asking for help"") implies ambivalence but does not reject suicidal thoughts outright.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Help-seeking event (""last night"") and long-term struggles (""20 some years"") are historical, but no past suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: Preparation is current (""wrote a note today"") and distress is immediate (""lately it feels like I just can't continue"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing dominates (e.g., ""how much longer I can keep going,"" ""last chance""), with no imminent terms like ""tonight"" or ""now.""

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation/immediacy)?** 
  - Explicit suicide intent: Indirect but strong (e.g., ""can't keep going"" + ""non existence after death doesn't deter me"" implies active desire to die, though not verbatim ""want to die""). 
  - Preparation evidence: ""wrote a note today"" qualifies as preparation per BEHAVIOR definition. 
  - No specific method or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight""). 
  - Outcome: Preparation meets BEHAVIOR criteria. 
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable due to preparation evidence.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable; preparation and implied intent exceed INDICATOR.

**Category Decision**: BEHAVIOR, due to explicit suicidal intent (inferred from overcoming fear of death and inability to continue) combined with preparation (writing a note). Although no immediate timeline is stated, preparation alone qualifies for BEHAVIOR per framework rules.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
- Writer-focused: Only the user's actions/thoughts considered (e.g., ignored father's comments).
- Temporal hierarchy: No ATTEMPT, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION.
- Immediacy trumps: Not needed; preparation suffices.
- Rejection downgrade: No explicit rejection (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""), so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
- Output one category: BEHAVIOR selected.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

   - Preparations/actions: None described  
   - **Rejection noted**: Explicitly states ""I have no plans and I don’t think I’d succeed anyway""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal thoughts (""I deserve to die"")  
   - **Critical rejection**: Explicitly disavows plans and capability (""no plans,"" ""don’t think I’d succeed"")

Final Classification: **indicator**  

*Rationale*: While the post contains graphic violent imagery and suicidal themes, the explicit disavowal of plans/immediacy (""no plans,"" ""don’t think I’d succeed"") triggers Rule 4 (rejection downgrade).

402,"I will die alone. I'm only alive by obligation. My parents don't deserve to bury their child. But the second they're gone, so am I.

But that shit's gone, long gone, and it isn't coming back. But it's all I want. I'm defined by that longing and I have been for years. I don't show it, I'm not thirsty, I don't act like an entitled incel. I just keep to myself. I don't even try anymore, what's the fucking point? I'm just a fucking sad man. And who wants to be with a sad man? Noone. So that's my company, forever. Noone. I'm just so fucking sick of this emptiness.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - **Explicit suicide references**: ""so am I"" (in context: ""the second they're gone, so am I"") implies suicide.  
   - **Indirect death references**: ""I will die alone"", ""alive by obligation"".  
   - **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""what's the fucking point?""), worthlessness (""hideous fucking mutant"", ""fat retard""), emptiness, and isolation.  
   - **Specific methods**: None mentioned.  
   - **Preparations**: None described.  
   - **Past actions**: No references to prior suicide attempts.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Ownership of suicidal intent (""so am I"" linked to parents' death).  
   - **Passive experience**: No framing as intrusive/unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Rejection noted**: No disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - **Future ideation**: Suicide intent is conditional (""the second they're gone"") with no specific/immediate timeline (parents' death is undefined).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Rules out ""attempt"".  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""so am I"") present, BUT lacks:  
     - Specific method/preparation.  
     - Immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"", ""now"").  
     → Does **not** meet ""behavior"" criteria.  
   - Explicit desire to die exists without plan/immediacy → Matches **ideation**.  
   - Not ""indicator"" due to active suicidal desire (conditional suicide statement).  

**Key Considerations**:  
- ""so am I"" = explicit future suicidal intent, but contingent on non-imminent event (parents' death).  
- No downgrade to ""indicator"" (no rejection of intent).  
- Temporal hierarchy: Future non-specific intent → ideation.

403,"don't know what to do but I'm here for now. got bad urges tonight. not even just suicidal ones, self destructive ones in general as well. they've been happening again for a while now, since I dropped out of college. I'm talking to some friends now. not about them or anything, just random stuff. it's helping, but I'm just lying here wondering if I should tell them. every conversation I have with them these days, I'm just thinking ""this might be our last conversation"". during our dnd sessions, I'm thinking it could be my last. then I read this post on tumblr about the aftermath of suicide on people left behind and I started crying. and there's four friends in particular I'd be worried about and I can't help but think about them and hate myself for thinking of killing myself, for what it's do to them and my sibling. and now it's just a guilty downward spiral but I can't do much about it right now, and I don't want to worry any of my friends by telling them how bad it is, like that I have a plan but no date set kind of bad. I don't know what I want anymore.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicidal ones"", ""killing myself""  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""don't know what I want""), guilt spiral, worthlessness (""hate myself"")  
   - Preparation: ""I have a plan"" (explicitly stated)  
   - Indirect references: ""this might be our last conversation""  
   - Rejection noted: ""hate myself for thinking of killing myself"" (due to impact on others)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active ownership: ""I have a plan"" shows personal intent.  
   - Rejection present but qualified: Guilt about consequences, yet no disavowal of intent (""but no date set"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Immediacy: ""urges tonight"" + ""last conversation"" thoughts during current interactions.  
   - Future ideation: ""no date set"" for the plan, but urges are active *now*.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit intent (""suicidal ones"", ""killing myself"") + specific preparation (""have a plan"") + immediacy (""tonight"") → Triggers BEHAVIOR per rules.  
   - Rejection (""hate myself"") is guilt-driven, not disavowal (e.g., lacks ""I won’t do it"") → Fails to downgrade to INDICATOR.  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""I have a plan"" + ""tonight"" urgency overrides non-specific date and rejection nuances per Irreducible Rules 2 (temporal hierarchy) and 3 (immediacy trumps).

404,"The questionnaires that include a question asking if I've had suicidal thoughts actually make me less likely to talk about. Because I know it'll cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress. There going to ask me too many details, and be too insistent with their questioning. I find therapy tough enough as it is, and if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great. Well it's great till it starts to happen more and more frequently. I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" directly, which is an explicit reference to suicide-related ideation.
- **Indirect death references**: The phrase ""get out of this grave I dug myself"" uses a metaphorical reference to death/burial, implying a desire to escape a dire situation but not explicitly about suicide.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough""), distress (""cause a massive issue and result in a lot of stress""), and emotional overwhelm (""therapy tough enough as it is"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, hanging, etc.).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., no evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations).
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" in relation to self-harm). The reference to ""suicidal thoughts"" is about thoughts, not actions.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: No active ownership of suicidal intent (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die""). The writer acknowledges having suicidal thoughts but does not express a current desire to act on them.
- **Passive experience**: Suicidal thoughts are presented as an intrusive experience (""if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff""), suggesting they are unwanted or managed.
- **Rejection noted**: Clear implicit rejection through avoidance behaviors—lying about the thoughts to prevent escalation (""if lying about the suicidal thoughts means we can focus on other stuff, then that's great""). This indicates disavowal of acting on the thoughts, even if not explicitly stated as ""but I won't do it.""

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: References past experiences with questionnaires and therapy, but suicidal thoughts are discussed as a recurring issue, not tied to a specific past event.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans or imminent action (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific concern about thoughts increasing in frequency (""till it starts to happen more and more frequently"") but no actionable timeline or plan.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start at the decision tree:
  - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) Explicit suicide intent? The phrase ""suicidal thoughts"" indicates ideation, but there is no active intent (e.g., ""I want to die""), specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
  - c) Explicit suicide desire? ""Suicidal thoughts"" could imply desire, but it is coupled with rejection (lying to avoid consequences) and lacks plan/immediacy. Additionally, the emotional content is more about distress than active wish → Not solely IDEATION due to rejection.
  - d) ONLY distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts: Yes. The core of the post is distress about therapy and suicidal thoughts (""massive issue,"" ""stress,"" ""tough""), metaphors (""grave""), and explicit rejection through avoidance (lying to focus on ""other stuff""). This fits INDICATOR, as there is no actionable suicidal intent.

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis focuses solely on the writer's experiences (e.g., ""I've had suicidal thoughts,"" ""I find therapy tough""), ignoring external factors.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No higher-level category (Attempt, Behavior, or Ideation with plan/immediacy) applies, as no attempt, behavior, or un-rejected ideation is present.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so immediacy does not elevate the category.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Implicit rejection of suicidal thoughts (lying to avoid escalation) downgrades from IDEATION to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one**: INDICATOR is the most appropriate category.

### CONCLUSION
The post expresses distress, hopelessness, and metaphorical death references, with suicidal thoughts presented as intrusive and rejected. This aligns with INDICATOR, defined as distress without actionable suicide intent.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""nearly killing myself"" (directly references suicidal action).  
   - Indirect death references: ""rotting away"" (metaphorical decay).  
   - Emotional markers: ""stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" expressions of hopelessness and injustice.  
   - Specific methods/preparations: ""shooting up the school"" (method mentioned, but framed as a past near-action).  
   - Past actions: ""bullied me into **nearly killing myself**"" (describes an aborted/contemplated action, not a full attempt).  
   - No active preparation or imminent timeline.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement**: ""I fucking hate living"" expresses current suicidal desire.  
   - **Rejection noted?**: None. No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past focus**: ""nearly killing myself"" references a historical crisis.  
   - **Present intent**: ""I fucking hate living"" indicates ongoing ideation without immediacy.  
   - **Future ideation**: No specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) **Past attempt?** ""Nearly killing myself"" implies serious contemplation but **not** an actual attempt (per rules: ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" required). → *No*.  
   - b) **Explicit intent + method/immediacy?** Explicit desire (""hate living"") exists, but **no method/preparation/imminent timeline** (""shooting up the school"" is past-tense and externally pressured). → *No*.  
   - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** ""I fucking hate living"" confirms active wish to die, with no actionable plan. → **YES**.  
   - d) *Only* distress/rejected thoughts? Rejected due to active suicidal desire.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
   - Writer-focused: All suicidal content references the writer (""me/I"").  
   - Temporal hierarchy: Past near-attempt doesn’t override current ideation (not an actual attempt).  
   - Immediacy: Absent (""tonight"" not used).  
   - Rejection: None.  
   - Output: Exactly one category.

   - Past actions: ""swallowed 120+ pills of ibuprofen and then sat and drank hard liquor"" (confirmed OD attempt), ""held off going to the hospital""  
   - Emotional markers: guilt (""feel stupid""), dissociation (""still feel weird""), intrusive thoughts (""thoughts just pop up"")  
   - Preparations: Actively consumed pills/alcohol  
   - **Key finding**: Direct description of a suicide attempt (""Survived OD"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:

   - **No** indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts (uses ""my"").  
   - **No rejection** noted (e.g., no disavowal like ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future ideation: ""has become my quick solution"" implies current consideration without specific timing (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

   - No explicit suicide references (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"").  
   - No indirect death references (e.g., ""not wake up,"" ""be gone"").  
   - Strong emotional markers: Hopelessness (""hard to keep going,"" ""never really goes away""), worthlessness (""mangled psychically""), and isolation (""only depressed people understand"").  
   - No methods, preparations, or past actions described. The ""*keep on keeping on*"" reference is a video game quote/metaphor for persistent struggle, not a suicide-related statement.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - No passive suicidal ideation (e.g., intrusive thoughts about death).  
   - Focus is on enduring depression, not suicidal intent. The phrase ""wonder if a long-term cure even exists"" implies seeking solutions, not rejecting suicidal thoughts.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:

   - Indirect death references: None.  
   - Emotional markers: ""felt like shit for years,"" ""reliving the same day,"" hopelessness implied.  
   - Specific methods/preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: None by the writer (father's suicide is irrelevant per Rule 1).  
   - Key phrase: ""**I get suicidal thoughts**"" (explicit ideation) but immediately rejected with ""**but I’m probably too much of a pussy to ever do it**.""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly disavowed (""too much of a pussy to ever do it""). Shows rejection of action.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct statements like ""i wanna off myself"" and ""if i killed myself"", which are clear references to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: No significant indirect references (e.g., ""not wake up"" or ""be gone""); the death references are tied to explicit suicide language.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness is evident (e.g., ""i can't see it getting better at fucking all"", ""i fucking hate it here"", and ""how fucking shit i feel""). Worthlessness is implied but not dominant.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). Therapy attendance is mentioned, but this is unrelated to suicidal behavior.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with direct, first-person statements like ""i wanna off myself"", indicating personal desire.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not framed as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" language); instead, they are actively expressed.
- **Rejection noted**: There is explicit ambivalence and disavowal of action due to fear (e.g., ""but i'm scared"" and ""i just wanna hang onto that string of hope""). However, this is not a full rejection like ""I won't do it""; it is hesitancy rather than a firm disavowal.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide attempts or actions.
- **Present intent**: No indication of immediate plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"" are absent).
- **Future ideation**: Suicidal desire is expressed with non-specific timing (e.g., ""i wanna off myself"" without when), fitting future ideation.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit intent (""i wanna off myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes, explicit suicidal desire is clear, but there is no actionable plan or immediacy → Points to IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No, because explicit suicidal desire is present, and rejection is ambivalent (not absolute) → Not solely INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Check**:
1. **Writer-focused**: All content is about the writer; no references to others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt mentioned, so hierarchy not triggered.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), so not applicable.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Ambivalence (""i'm scared"") noted, but no explicit disavowal (e.g., ""I don't actually want to"" or ""I won't do it""). Desire remains active, so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: IDEATION is the best fit based on explicit desire without plan or immediacy.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses active suicidal desire but lacks specific plans, preparations, or imminent timelines. Fear and hope introduce ambivalence, but not enough to override the explicit ideation. Category boundaries confirm IDEATION (e.g., ""Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with 'tonight' or 'now'"" — absent here).

Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""i want to give up my life and just die"", ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"", ""suicidal thoughts""  
   - Emotional markers: Profound hopelessness (""THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME""), worthlessness (""I hate myself""), despair (""I FEEL TRAPED"")  
   - **No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts** described (e.g., no pills, notes, or ""tried to"" statements)  
   - Indirect rejection via parental concern (""i can't leave my parents"") but **no disavowal of desire**  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement**: Direct ownership of suicidal desire (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"")  
   - **Passive experience**: Suicidal thoughts described as intrusive (""eating me up"")  
   - **Rejection noted**: Parental concern implied (""can't leave my parents"") but **no explicit disavowal** of intent (e.g., no ""I won’t do it"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Present/future focus**: Desires/thoughts are current (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE""), but **no imminent timeline** (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). Future despair (""IF I LIVE I KNOW I WILL NEVER BE HAPPY"") is non-specific.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - ❌ No past attempt described → *Not ATTEMPT*  
   - ❌ Explicit intent + **no method/prep/immediacy** → *Not BEHAVIOR*  
   - ✅ **Explicit desire** (""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"") + **no plan/immediacy** → *IDEATION*  
   - ❌ Not *only* distress/rejected thoughts (due to active suicidal desire) → *Not INDICATOR*  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE"" is unambiguous active ideation without mitigation (parental concern implies burden, not rejection of intent).  
- Temporal references lack immediacy (""tonight""), and no methods/preparations exist.  
- *Irreducible Rule 4*: Rejection absent (e.g., no ""but I won’t act""); parental attachment doesn’t negate active desire.

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **Content Deconstruction**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I've been contemplating suicide"" and ""I'm ending it"" are direct statements of suicidal intent.
   - Indirect death references: ""I didn't want to live before I met her"" and ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore"" imply a desire to cease living, but are contextual to the suicide plan.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""I don't get any joy out of life""), worthlessness (""I don't feel love for anyone""), and emotional pain (""feeling numb since I was 12"") are present.
   - Specific methods: While the user describes a history of self-harm (""cutting myself""), this is framed as a coping mechanism (""to subvert the pain to a physical one"") and not explicitly as a suicide method. No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) is stated for the user's own plans.
   - Preparations: The agreement with the girl (""we agreed if she should want to kill herself then we will do it together"") indicates a conditional plan for joint suicide, which can be seen as preparation. However, no concrete individual preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described.
   - Past actions: The user's self-harm is historical and ongoing but is not described as a suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of intent to die). The girl's suicide attempt is mentioned, but per Rule 1 (writer-focused), this is ignored.

2. **Intent Analysis**:
   - Active endorsement: The user explicitly claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I've been contemplating suicide"" and ""I'm ending it""), showing clear personal intent.
   - Passive experience: No evidence of intrusive thoughts; the suicidal ideation is presented as self-driven.
   - Rejection noted: There is no disavowal (e.g., no statements like ""but I won't do it""). The conditional plan (""if she gone"") does not negate intent but rather specifies a trigger.

3. **Temporal Framework**:
   - Past focus: Historical self-harm and numbness are described, but no past suicide attempt by the user is indicated.
   - Present intent: The statement ""I'm ending it"" expresses immediate intent, especially when combined with ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore."" This suggests action will be taken imminently if the condition (the girl being ""gone"") is met.
   - Future ideation: ""Contemplating suicide"" over the past month represents non-specific timing, but the concluding statement shifts to a more immediate timeframe.

4. **Category Decision Tree**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described for the user (self-harm is not equated to an attempt per clarification), so not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""contemplating suicide"" and ""I'm ending it"") is present. While no specific method or concrete preparation is detailed, the expression ""I'm ending it"" constitutes immediate intent (per Behavior clarification: ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details""). The conditional trigger (""if she gone"") does not eliminate the immediacy, as it reflects a current decision to act upon that condition. Thus, this meets the threshold for BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire exists, but the presence of immediacy (""I'm ending it"") rules out IDEATION (per boundary: Becomes BEHAVIOR if paired with immediacy).
   - d) Distress and emotional markers are present, but explicit suicidal intent overrides INDICATOR.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
- Rule 1 (Writer-focused): Ignore the girl's suicide attempt; focus only on the user's statements.
- Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy): No attempt described, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence over IDEATION due to immediacy.
- Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): ""I'm ending it"" indicates immediate intent, trumping non-specific ideation.
- Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): No rejection of suicidal thoughts; intent is affirmed.
- Rule 5 (Output exactly one): BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable category.

Final classification: BEHAVIOR, due to explicit suicidal intent combined with an expression of immediate action (""I'm ending it""), qualifying under Behavior's ""immediate intent"" criterion despite the conditional trigger.

And everybody keeps telling me to do things I can't do. So I'm fucked.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill yourself"" (used rhetorically but in self-referential context) and ""I need to die"" (direct personal statement).
   - Indirect death references: ""Life isn't worth it without her"" and ""better than living in pain"" imply a preference for death.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""I can't,"" ""I'm alone,"" ""can't be helped""), worthlessness (""People like me are just fundamentally wrong""), and unbearable pain (""living in pain,"" ""it's better than living in pain"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, firearms, etc.).
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
   - Past actions: ""I've fucking tried"" refers to attempts to cope or move on (e.g., ""everybody keeps telling me to do things I can't do""), not a suicide attempt. No description of past self-harm with suicidal intent.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I need to die,"" ""kill yourself"" in a self-applicable context) and justifies it as ""perfectly reasonable."" No presentation as intrusive or passive.
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). Thoughts are actively endorsed.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: ""I've fucking tried"" describes past efforts to cope, not suicide-related actions.
   - Present intent: Desire expressed (""I need to die"") but no specific plan, method, or immediate timeline (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Future ideation: General timing implied (""it's better than living in pain""), but non-specific.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""need to die"") present, but no specific method/preparation and no immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire (""need to die,"" ""kill yourself"" in personal context) without plan or immediacy → IDEATION.
   - d) Distress and hopelessness are present, but explicit suicidal desire rules out INDICATOR.

**Category Definitions Applied**:
- **Ideation** fits: Active suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) with no actionable plan or imminent timeline. The statement ""I need to die"" is explicit, but lack of method details or preparation keeps it in ideation.
- **Boundary Check**: No ""tonight"" or similar immediacy to elevate to behavior; no past attempt to override.
- **Irreducible Rules Compliance**:

The problem is not your dad or his girlfriend by any matters. The problem is YOU. If you disappeared, I assure you that your dad would be happier, and don't start with your depression bullshit, that I got tired of that"" -My mom. ""I'M TALKING TO YOU! ANSWER! You know what? Just shoot yourself already"" -mom. ""You know I always invite you with my girlfriend? But you never want to come. I'm not leaving you alone; you are leaving yourself alone. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"" -Dad. ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again? So be it, You are too coward to actually do it, anyway"" -Dad. ""Did you vomit your food again? I'm tired of this shit. You are wasting MY MONEY. You know what? I won't buy you food anymore because you vomit it anyways. That valuable money could serve other purpose and don't you dare tell your mother about this because you are the one that started this problem"" -Dad. ""I just had a lot of fun with my girlfriend and her daughters. Oh! You were there? I didn't even notice you"" -Dad. ""What? Had a bad day at school? Are you going to try to kill yourself again?

Dad: When I had a daughter, I didn't know it was going to be as disappointing as you. ""All the family knows about you. They are al disappointed"" -mom. &amp;#x200B;. To be continued.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: Parents say ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already,"" ""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again.""  
   - Emotional markers: Writer experiences worthlessness (""disappointing,"" ""problem,"" ""disappeared""), hopelessness (""dad would be happier"").  
   - Past actions referenced: Parents accuse writer of past attempts (""try to kill yourself again,"" ""cut your wrists again,"" ""vomit your food"").  
   - **Critical note**: All suicidal content is *quoted from parents*, not self-expressed by the writer. Writer's only direct statement questions their father's motives without suicidal language.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Writer never endorses suicidal thoughts. Parents' commands (""kill yourself"") are hostile provocations, not adopted by writer.  
   - Writer expresses distress through parental quotes but shows no ownership of suicidal intent.  
   - No rejection phrases needed since writer never introduces personal suicidal ideation.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - References to suicide are either:  
     - Parental commands (future-oriented but not writer's intent).  
     - Parental accusations of *past* attempts (""did you try,"" ""again"").  
   - Writer shares no personal current/future plans or desires.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) Past attempt? Parental accusations exist, but **writer never describes their own attempt**. Accusations ≠ self-report.  
   - b/c/d) No explicit suicidal desire, method, preparation, or timeline from writer. Distress is evident through emotional abuse quotes.  
   - **IRREDUCIBLE RULE #1**: Ignore parents' actions. Focus *only* on writer's words. Writer expresses anguish but no suicidal intent.  

**Conclusion**: Quotes depict severe distress and exposure to suicidal rhetoric, but writer demonstrates no personal suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior. Falls under INDICATOR (distress without actionable suicide intent).

415,What's the least painful way to kill yourself?. I know I shouldn't be asking this but I just need a way to Kim's. I don't wanna hear all this livings the least painful way shit someone just give me a straight up answer.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""kill yourself"" and ""kill myself"" (inferred from ""way to Kim's"" as a likely typo for ""kill myself"" based on context). Also includes ""least painful way to die"" indirectly.
- **Indirect death references**: ""least painful way to kill yourself"" implies seeking methods for death.
- **Emotional markers**: Distress and frustration are evident (""I know I shouldn't be asking this,"" ""I don't wanna hear all this... shit""), suggesting desperation but no explicit hopelessness or worthlessness.
- **Specific methods**: None identified; the query is general (""least painful way"") without naming pills, hanging, etc.
- **Preparations**: No evidence (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of prior suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: Strong ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I just need a way to kill myself"" from inferred typo), indicating personal desire.
- **Passive experience**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Partial hesitation (""I know I shouldn't be asking this"") but not a disavowal of intent; it is overridden by the active need (""but I just need a way""). No explicit rejection like ""I won't do it.""

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Absent; no historical references.
- **Present intent**: Seeking information now, but no stated plan for immediate action (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific timing; desire for a method is expressed without when it might be used.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
- b) Explicit suicide intent (""need a way to kill myself"") is present, but lacks specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- c) Explicit suicide desire (""need a way to kill myself"") with non-actionable method (""least painful way"") and no preparation/immediacy → Matches IDEATION.
- d) Distress is present, but explicit suicidal desire overrules it; not ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts → Not INDICATOR.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- IDEATION fits: Active suicidal desire (""want to die"" equivalent) with non-actionable method (""painless way"") and no plan/timeline. The inquiry about methods is general, not preparatory.
- **Key boundary**: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") or method specificity to escalate to BEHAVIOR.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  1. Writer-focused: Content is solely about the user.
  2. Temporal hierarchy: No higher category (attempt/behavior) applies.
  3. Immediacy: Absent, so IDEATION not overruled.
  4. Rejection: Hesitation does not constitute rejection; active desire persists.
  5. Output exactly one category: IDEATION is the clearest fit.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""suicidal note"" (directly references suicide preparation).  
   - Preparation evidence: ""write a suicidal note again"" (indicates concrete action; ""again"" implies recurrence).  
   - Emotional markers: ""pain on the inside"" (distress), but no explicit death wish or method.  
   - **No** method details, timeline (""tonight""), past attempts, or rejection.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I think I’m going to"" shows ownership of preparation.  
   - **No** disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - ""Going to"" implies imminent future action (not abstract ideation).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → No past attempt described (rules out ATTEMPT).  
   - → Explicit preparation (""write a suicidal note"") + active intent → **BEHAVIOR** (per rule: ""preparation evidence"" qualifies).  
   - *Not IDEATION*: Preparation overrules passive ideation.  
   - *Not INDICATOR*: Direct suicide-linked action trumps distress alone.  

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:  
   - Writer-focused: Only discusses own actions.  
   - Preparation evidence (""suicidal note"") → BEHAVIOR (Critical Expansion rule).  
   - No downgrade (no rejection).

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""slaying myself"" is a direct synonym for ""killing myself,"" indicating explicit suicide intent.
- **Indirect death references**: ""committing a massacre"" implies violence but is not suicide-specific and focuses on harming others, not self. Per rules, ignore mentions involving others.
- **Emotional markers**: No clear expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain; the tone is declarative with uncertainty (""maybe"").
- **Specific methods**: ""Slaying myself"" is vague—no details on means (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No references to past attempts (e.g., ""tried"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The phrase ""slaying myself"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I"" statement). ""Maybe"" introduces ambivalence but does not reject the idea outright (e.g., no disavowal like ""but I won't do it"").
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not presented as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit rejection (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""). Ambivalence (""maybe"") does not qualify as rejection per rules.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Future ideation**: ""I will end up"" indicates non-specific future timing (e.g., no immediacy like ""tonight"" or ""now""). ""Committing a massacre"" is also future-oriented but irrelevant per writer-focused rule.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start here → 
  - a) **Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** Explicit intent (""slaying myself"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Yes → IDEATION.
  - d) **Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, due to explicit suicide desire; ""massacre"" could be metaphorical distress, but it is overruled by direct suicidal expression.

### Category Alignment
- **IDEATION** fits: Explicit wish to die (""slaying myself"") with no actionable plan, preparation, or immediacy. ""Maybe"" indicates uncertainty but does not downgrade to INDICATOR per rules (only explicit rejection does). ""Committing a massacre"" is disregarded as it involves others and is not suicide-focused.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: ""Slaying myself"" is self-targeted; ""massacre"" (involving others) ignored.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or present behavior, so IDEATION stands.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), so no upgrade to BEHAVIOR.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't""), so no downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is the highest applicable category.

I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: Writer explicitly states ""my suicidal ideation"" but immediately follows with rejection (""I don't want to die"").  
   - Indirect death references: None (e.g., no ""be gone,"" ""painless way"").  
   - Emotional markers: Strong distress (shame, feeling ""stupid,"" overwhelmed), hopelessness (""can't escape my laziness""), worthlessness (""shame of not being anybody"").  
   - Methods/preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: No mention of attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" regarding suicide).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Writer explicitly **rejects** active desire (""I don't want to die"") and frames ideation as stemming from shame, not current intent.  
   - Passive experience: Describes ""suicidal ideation"" as an intrusive byproduct of shame (""stems from""), not an active choice.  
   - Rejection: Clear disavowal (""I don't want to die— I want to live"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Ideation is mentioned in present tense but explicitly rejected and contextualized as a symptom of shame, with no timeline (""tonight,"" ""now"") or urgency.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt described → **Not ATTEMPT**.  
   - Explicit suicide desire is actively rejected → **Not BEHAVIOR/IDEATION**.  
   - Only distress (shame, hopelessness) + rejected thoughts (""I don't want to die"") → **INDICATOR**.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""Suicidal ideation"" mention is downgraded due to explicit rejection (Rule 4).  
- No actionable intent, method, or timeline.  
- Distress/metaphors (""drowned out by passivity"") without suicide intent.

- **Preparation**: Access to means (""get my dad's handgun"")
- **Emotional markers**: Fear of consequences (""permanently disabled"")

  - Active suicidal desire is explicitly rejected  
  - Specific method mention is counterbalanced by refusal to act  

**Key Judgment**: While method specificity would typically suggest BEHAVIOR, the unambiguous rejection of action (""not risking it"") overrides this per Rule 4. The post demonstrates distress and suicidal thoughts but explicitly rules out action.

My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: None present. The post contains phrases like ""my life isnt worth living anymore"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving,"" which express hopelessness but lack direct terms such as ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live.""
- **Indirect death references**: None. No phrases like ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die"" are used.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of hopelessness (""my life isnt worth living anymore""), worthlessness (""degree that is useless,"" ""live now from social welfare""), and unbearable pain (""it has become unbearable""). Helplessness, anger, and sadness are explicitly stated (""I feel so helpless, angry and sad"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned. No references to pills, hanging, jumping, firearms, or any other means.
- **Preparations**: None. No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: None. No descriptions of suicide attempts, such as ""tried to"" or ""attempted.""

### Step 2: Intent Analysis (Critical)
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. Phrases like ""my life isnt worth living"" and ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" reflect passive despair about life circumstances rather than active suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die"").
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts. The distress is presented as a reaction to ongoing health and life issues, not as involuntary or externalized thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts because suicidal intent is not present. Instead, the writer expresses a wish for external help (""I wish there would be a God that could intervene""), which implies a desire for change or relief, not death.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: Descriptions of historical events (e.g., getting sick in March 2020, leaving university, moving home) but no past suicide actions.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The writer states, ""I just try to get through the day,"" indicating coping rather than action.
- **Future ideation**: Conditional hopelessness (""If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving"") but no specific or actionable suicide timing. This is non-specific and lacks a plan.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ""attempt.""
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicide intent (e.g., ""want to die"") and no method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Not ""behavior.""
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"" or ""don't deserve to live""). Phrases like ""life isnt worth living"" convey hopelessness but are not actionable or explicit suicidal desire → Not ""ideation.""
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post contains general distress, hopelessness, and despair (""unbearable,"" ""helpless, angry and sad""), metaphorical expressions (""my life isnt worth living""), and no rejected suicidal thoughts because no such thoughts are expressed. Falls under ""indicator"" as per category definitions.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Matches due to ""general unhappiness, hopelessness, or despair"" with no expressions of active suicidal desire. The phrase ""I cant see myself having a life worthliving"" is a metaphorical death reference without suicide context. The wish for divine intervention reinforces a desire for help, not death.
- **Irreducible Rules**:
  - Writer-focused: Only the writer's distress is considered; no mentions of others.
  - Temporal hierarchy: Not applicable as no attempt, behavior, or ideation is present.
  - Immediacy trumps: No immediacy.
  - Rejection downgrade: Not applicable since no suicidal thoughts to reject.
  - Output exactly one: Indicator is the appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""kill myself""  
   - Death reference: ""be gone""  
   - Emotional markers: ""don't see the point anymore"" (hopelessness)  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past actions described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I’m going to kill myself"" (ownership of intent)  
   - No rejection (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future ideation: ""soon,"" ""by February"" (non-immediate timeline)  
   - Explicitly rejects immediacy: ""wait a bit,"" avoids Christmas  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- Explicit suicide references: ""want to die"", ""gonna end my life""  
- Emotional markers: Self-blame (""fucked up person""), overwhelming problems  
- No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts described  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- Active endorsement: Direct ownership (""I just want to die"", ""gonna end my life"")  
- No rejection or disavowal of thoughts  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- Future timeline: ""gonna end my life **this month**"" (specific but not immediate)  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- No past attempt → Rule out ATTEMPT  
- Explicit intent + specific timeline (""this month"") → **BUT** ""this month"" lacks *immediacy* per rules (""tonight""/""now"" required for BEHAVIOR).  
- Explicit desire without actionable plan/immediacy → IDEATION  

**Key Boundary Check:**  
- ""End my life this month"" specifies timing but falls outside ""imminent"" scope (e.g., ""tonight"").  
- No method/preparation details → Confirms IDEATION per category definitions.  

**Irreducible Rules Applied:**

I got called pessimistic and it's because I'm suffering I mean yes my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world and better solutions I got hate for being realistic and honest yes ofc. If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it I won't judge, you may be a good parent",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""suicidal thoughs"" (a clear misspelling of ""thoughts""), which directly references suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""the world is falling apart and soon will turn into hell"" are metaphorical and reflect a bleak worldview but are not direct death references.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""the world is falling apart,"" ""turn into hell""), worthlessness (feeling misunderstood, called ""pessimistic""), and suffering (""I'm suffering,"" ""mental illnesses"") are present.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). ""Suicidal thoughs"" refers to ongoing thoughts, not concrete actions.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of ""suicidal thoughs"" (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs""), but there is no explicit statement of current intent (e.g., ""I want to die""). The thoughts are presented as part of their experience rather than an active plan.
- **Passive experience**: The description (""helped me to understood the world"") suggests the thoughts are intrusive or background elements, not actively pursued.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The writer normalizes the thoughts and shifts focus to others (""If you are mental ill or suicidal... I won't judge""), but this does not constitute personal rejection.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide attempts. Mentions of ""suicidal thoughs"" lack a specific past context.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans, immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""), or preparation.
- **Future ideation**: No expressions of future timing (e.g., ""someday""). The suicidal thoughts are described as a general state without temporal specificity.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past attempt described?** → No. The post mentions ""suicidal thoughs"" but no actual attempt (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""). → Not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + (method/preparation OR immediacy)?** → Explicit suicide reference (""suicidal thoughs"") exists, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). → Not BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → ""Suicidal thoughs"" constitutes an explicit expression of suicidal desire (equivalent to ""want to die"" in context), but there is no actionable plan or immediacy. → IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Not applicable, as there is an explicit suicide reference (""suicidal thoughs""), which rules out INDICATOR per the definition (indicator requires ""NO expressions of active suicidal desire"").

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Excluded due to explicit ""suicidal thoughs"" reference, which implies active suicidal desire. Distress and metaphors are present but not standalone.
- **Ideation**: Fits because of explicit suicidal desire (""suicidal thoughs"") without plan or immediacy.
- **Behavior**: Excluded due to lack of method, preparation, or immediacy.
- **Attempt**: Excluded due to no past actions described.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis centers on the writer's own ""suicidal thoughs""; mentions of others are ignored.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt or behavior, so ideation is the highest applicable category.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to override ideation.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection of thoughts, so no downgrade to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: IDEATION is selected.

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""If I kill myself""  
   - Emotional markers: ""nothings gonna work"", ""maybe I wasn’t cut out for life"", ""done being this sad fucked up person""  
   - Preparation: ""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""  
   - No past attempts described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - No rejection noted (e.g., no disavowal like ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future timeline: ""it’ll be on my birthday"" (specific future date).  
   - Preparation phase: ""plenty of time to plan"".  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

   - Does not meet IDEATION criteria (explicit desire lacks plan/timeline) because timeline/preparation exists.  
   - Does not meet INDICATOR (active suicidal intent present).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""thinking of ending it all"" (clear suicidal ideation).
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""what is the point""), worthlessness (""I'm a failure,"" ""Burden on my family""), self-blame (""all the bad things... because of me""), and isolation (""fighting this battle alone"").
   - **No** indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions described.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: ""I've been thinking of ending it all"" shows ownership of suicidal thoughts.
   - **No** rejection or disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it"").

I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I want to do this once and for all"" and ""I want to get it over with"" imply ending life, especially when combined with ""my death will be following very soon."" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" directly references suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None beyond the explicit references; ""my death"" is straightforward.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness is implied in the desire to end things permanently, and guilt/sorrow is expressed (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom""), but no explicit worthlessness or unbearable pain.
- **Specific methods**: No method details (e.g., pills, firearms) are mentioned.
- **Preparations**: Evidence of preparation is clear: ""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" This aligns with setting affairs in order, similar to writing a suicide note.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" referring to history).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I want to do this,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend""). This is direct and personal, not framed as passive or intrusive.
- **Passive experience**: No language suggesting intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent. The expression of sorrow for the mother (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom"") reflects concern but does not reject or downplay the plan (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: None; no references to prior suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: Not immediate (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""); the timeline is ""this weekend,"" which is imminent but not present.
- **Future ideation**: Specific imminent timeline (""this weekend"") with clear intent (""I'll most likely attempt""), moving beyond vague ideation.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""want to do this,"" ""get it over with,"" ""attempt this weekend"").  
  - Preparation evidence: Yes (getting a will in place).  
  - Imminent timeline: Yes (""this weekend"" qualifies as imminent per framework, similar to ""this weekend"" examples).  
  - → **BEHAVIOR** (fulfills criteria: intent + preparation + immediacy).
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as preparation and timeline are present.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** No, due to active intent and preparation.

### Final Category Rationale
- **Behavior category**: The post demonstrates explicit suicidal intent, concrete preparation (will), and an imminent timeline (""this weekend""). Per the framework, preparation (e.g., writing a will) qualifies as evidence of capability, and ""this weekend"" meets the immediacy threshold. The absence of method details is overruled by the critical expansion rule: ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details."" No rejection or downgrade factors apply.
- **Irreducible rules**: Writer-focused (ignores mother's context), temporal hierarchy (no attempt, so behavior is highest), immediacy trumps (weekend timeline beats non-specific ideation), no rejection, output one category.

427,"I don't want to. The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up. But for the first time i don't wanna die, it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do and I'm in the middle of making plans to move and i don't want to waste money to then die right after. But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep. It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room and I'll have more space to put all the projects i have in mind, I'm having millions thoughts of stuff i wanna do (probably just mania acting up), it's like i have a purpose or something. I'm in a decent place right now and i want to keep doing things. I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains phrases like ""I'll live till October"" (implying a threat to survival), ""die right after"", and ""cannot live if I fail"", which suggest suicidal thoughts but are conditional. Direct terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I'll live till October"", ""die right after"", and ""cannot live if I fail"" imply death as a possible outcome, tied to the test result.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness is present in ""I really cannot live if I fail"", but this is balanced by expressions of improvement: ""almost happy"", ""enjoying doing stuff"", ""have a purpose"", ""decent place"", and ""feeling better"".
- **Specific methods**: Methods are referenced historically: ""meds"" (pills), ""jump from"" (jumping), and ""blades I used to cut"" (cutting). However, access is currently denied: ""no access to my meds"", ""no place to jump from"", and ""blades... won't go that deep"".
- **Preparations**: No evidence of current preparation; instead, barriers are noted (e.g., lack of access). Life-oriented preparations are mentioned: ""making plans to move"" and future projects.
- **Past actions**: ""The blades I used to cut"" indicates past self-harm, but it is not described as a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" with suicidal intent). It appears as historical non-lethal self-harm.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer explicitly rejects suicidal desire: ""for the first time I don't wanna die"", ""I don't want to waste money to then die right after"", and ""I want to keep doing things"". Suicidal thoughts are conditional (""if I fail"") but disavowed in the present.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive thoughts described (e.g., ""my brain tells me""). Thoughts are presented as reflective and rejected.
- **Rejection noted**: Strong, explicit disavowal: ""I don't wanna die"" and ""I want to keep doing things"" dominate the narrative, downgrading risk.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Historical references to self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") and missed opportunities (""the right time is gone""), but no description of a past suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: No current intent or plan. The writer states feeling ""decent"" and ""better"", with desires to continue living and planning. Barriers to methods (e.g., no access) reinforce lack of present capability.
- **Future ideation**: Suicide is framed as conditional and non-specific: ""cannot live if I fail"" depends on a future test outcome, but no timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is attached. ""I don't even know how I'll do it"" indicates no actionable plan.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No. ""Used to cut"" describes self-harm without stated suicidal intent, so it does not qualify as an attempt.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: No. While methods are mentioned, they are inaccessible and not tied to current preparation. The conditional intent (""if I fail"") lacks immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"") and is rejected. Explicit suicidal desire is absent due to disavowal.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan?**: No. Any wish to die (e.g., ""cannot live if I fail"") is conditional, non-immediate, and outweighed by active rejection and positive present-state descriptions.
- **d) ONLY distress/rejected thoughts**: Yes. The core content shows distress about the test and historical risk factors, but with metaphors (""live till October""), explicit rejection of suicide, and no actionable intent. This fits INDICATOR per clarifications: ""I'm going to die soon"" without suicide context is an indicator, and rejection downgrades the category.

**Irreducible Rules Application**:
1. Writer-focused: All analysis centers on the writer; no external mentions.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, behavior, or ideation overrules due to rejection and lack of immediacy.
3. Immediacy trumps: No terms like ""tonight""; conditional future ideation is not immediate.
4. Rejection downgrade: Explicit disavowal (""don't wanna die"", ""want to keep doing things"") forces downgrade to INDICATOR.
5. Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is selected.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end my life,"" or ""not want to live"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: None. No mentions of ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or ""painless way to die.""
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I don't see a point,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"") and worthlessness (""all the work I've put into it has been useless,"" ""only seen as special if people need or want something from us"").

- **Preparations**: None. No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: None. No descriptions of ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or past self-harm with suicidal intent.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die"" is not present). The post focuses on systemic frustration and personal depletion, not active suicidal desire.
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive thoughts (e.g., ""my brain tells me to"" suicidal ideas).
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicide because suicide is not mentioned. The distress is general, with no suicidal content to reject.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Describes historical experiences (e.g., ""through school,"" ""work I've put into it""), but these relate to life struggles, not past suicide attempts.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific suicidal timing (e.g., ""someday"" about suicide). The future-oriented ""I don't know what to do anymore"" expresses uncertainty, not ideation.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit intent, method, preparation, or timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post shows distress (hopelessness, worthlessness, exhaustion) and metaphors (""stuck in a system,"" ""milked out of work labor""), but no suicidal content. Falls under INDICATOR per category definitions (general unhappiness/despair without actionable suicide intent). The phrase ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" is a vague metaphor for purposelessness, similar to the clarification example (""I'm going to die soon"" without suicide context → indicator).

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Future intent**: Conditional timeline (""Once I get a place, or hell even if I don't""). No fixed immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), but urgency implied (""I'm just waiting for the end"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not **Attempt**.  
   - b) **Explicit suicide intent** + **specific methods** (slitting wrists, firearms) + **preparations** (planning for housing/conditions) → **Behavior**.  
   - c) Explicit desire exists, but overruled by method specificity and preparation.  
   - d) Distress present, but suicide intent is active and planned → Not **Indicator**.  

**Key Justifications**:  
- Rule 2 (Temporal Hierarchy): No past attempt or *immediate* timeline (""tonight""), but specific methods + preparations → **Behavior**.  
- Rule 4 (Rejection): ""I want help"" reflects ambivalence but doesn’t disavow intent; plans remain concrete.  
- Rule 5: Output one category.

I don't understand why they think it's so fun to play with my emotions. I don't know what I'm doing wrong, I have abandonment issues and I'm studying psychology, pretending like I want to become a psychologist, so that I can solve my own problems. I'm 6'1 195 lbs., I genuinely enjoy working out and playing all kinds of sports. But whenever I confront someone about something my voice shakes. This girl is literally playing the fuck out of me and I don't know what to do. Is it true? Do you have to choose money or love? I thought I could do both why didn't someone tell me the truth? If I knew it was true the choice is fucking obvious?. God am I just paranoid as fuck?

**1. CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**  
- **Explicit suicide references**: None found (""want to die"", ""kill myself"", etc. absent).  
- **Indirect death references**: None (""not wake up"", ""be gone"" not present).  
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress (""world is shit"", ""abandonment issues"", ""paranoid"", ""unlovable"", ""want to cry my eyes out"", ""PTSD"").  
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (pills, firearms, etc.).  
- **Preparations**: No evidence (no notes, acquiring means).  
- **Past actions**: No described suicide attempts.  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**  
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die"" absent).  
- **Passive experience**: No intrusive suicidal thoughts described.  
- **Rejection noted**: N/A (no suicidal thoughts to reject).  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**  
- **Past**: References to breakup/PTSD, but no past suicide actions.  
- **Present**: Current distress (""want to cry right now""), but no suicide intent.  
- **Future**: No future suicidal ideation.  

**4. CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**  
- a) **No past attempt** described → Not ""Attempt"".

**Key Observations:**  
- Strong expressions of hopelessness (""world is shit""), worthlessness (""unlovable""), and confusion dominate.  
- Closest to suicidal ideation is ""I want to disappear"" (metaphorical), but framework classifies this as **Indicator** when lacking explicit suicidal desire.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I wanna kill myself"", ""contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that"", ""offing myself"", ""die because I hate myself"".  
   - Specific methods/preparations: Detailed calculations for isopropyl alcohol poisoning, testing noose attachment points, scouting timing for jumping in front of a car, planning to avoid family detection.  
   - Emotional markers: Profound self-hatred (""Idiot. Disappointment...""), hopelessness (""nothing works anymore""), worthlessness (""I'm not worth their time"").  
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal (""But I don't do it. I don't deserve to... Death is too damn easy... I cannot afford myself that luxury"").  
   - No past attempts described (only ideation/preparation).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal desire (""I wanna kill myself"", ""I want to die"").  
   - Clear rejection of acting on plans: ""But I don't do it..."" framed as moral imperative (undeserving of ""release"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Chronic ideation (""years""), recent quarantine-era planning.  
   - Present contemplation (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"") but explicitly halted by rejection.  
   - No imminent timeline (rejects acting despite having plans).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - ❌ No described past attempt → *not ATTEMPT*.  
   - ❌ Explicit intent + specific plans BUT paired with explicit rejection and no immediacy → *fails BEHAVIOR criteria* (Rule 4: Rejection downgrades).  
   - ❌ Explicit desire present BUT rejection nullifies active intent → *fails IDEATION* (Rule 4).  
   - ✅ Suicidal thoughts + detailed planning + metaphors (""Death is a mercy"") + **explicit disavowal of action** → INDICATOR (Rule 4: Rejection downgrades to indicator despite method specificity).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Method/preparation details alone don't override the categorical rejection of action (""I don't do it"").  
- ""Right now"" refers to *contemplation*, not imminent intent (contrasted with ""tonight"" in rules).  
- Self-punishment narrative (""must remain and suffer"") actively suppresses transition to behavior.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself"" (stated twice).  
   - Indirect death references: ""might end up in hell / whatever comes after this"".  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""i'm not cut out for life"", ""can't even imagine mine being worth living""), worthlessness (""selfish and weak"").  
   - Specific methods: None mentioned.  
   - Preparations: ""the day i chose is very soon"" implies timeline selection and planning.  
   - Past actions: ""wanted to do this for over a decade"" (ideation, not attempt).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Claims ownership (""i shouldn't kill myself"" acknowledges personal desire; rejects intervention with ""not interested in being talked down"").  
   - No rejection: No disavowal of intent (e.g., ""but I won't do it"" is absent; instead, reinforces commitment).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present intent: ""the day i chose is very soon"" indicates imminent timeline (not vague).  
   - Future ideation: Supported by decade-long desire, but immediacy (""very soon"") dominates.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No described past attempt → not **Attempt**.  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""kill myself"") + preparation/timeline (""day i chose is very soon"") → **Behavior** per rules (immediacy qualifies without method details).  
   - Ideation alone would apply if no immediacy, but ""very soon"" overrides.  

**RULES VERIFICATION**  
- Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Immediacy (""very soon"") elevates to **Behavior**.  
- No rejection: Dismisses intervention but not the act itself.  
- Output: Single category required.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""This the most suicidal I've been"" and ""I just want to be out of my misery"" directly indicate suicidal desire.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""I've been in pain for over 5 years""), worthlessness (""cba anymore""), and isolation (""abandoning everyone,"" ""Not going to contact anyone"").  
   - **Absent**: Methods, preparations, past attempts, or indirect death references.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Ownership of suicidal feelings (""I've been,"" ""I just want"").  
   - **Absent**: Rejection (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") or passive framing.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present focus: ""This the most suicidal I've been"" implies current ideation.  
   - **Absent**: Immediacy (""tonight"") or future specificity. Timeline is vague (""in a couple months"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → a) **No described past attempt** → Not ATTEMPT.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself"" are direct expressions of suicidal desire.
   - Indirect death references: ""Why is it so hard to die"" implies frustration with the concept of death but is not indirect on its own due to the explicit context.
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness and distress are present (e.g., ""Why is it so hard""), but no explicit unbearable pain or worthlessness.
   - Specific methods: None mentioned; ""suitable way to go"" is vague and non-actionable, with no details like pills, hanging, etc.
   - Preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting; the phrase ""can't find a suitable way"" indicates lack of preparation.
   - Past actions: No references to prior attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer directly claims ownership with ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself,"" showing personal suicidal desire.
   - Passive experience: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" framing).
   - Rejection noted?: The phrase ""but I can't find a suitable way"" expresses inability or frustration, not explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""I won't do it""). Intent remains active.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Absent; no historical descriptions.
   - Present intent: Desire is expressed in present tense (""want""), but no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: Non-specific timing; frustration with ""hard to die"" and seeking a ""suitable way"" suggests ongoing, non-imminent thoughts.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent present (""want to die/kill myself""), but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy: Desire is clear, but ""can't find a suitable way"" confirms no actionable plan and no urgency → Matches IDEATION.
   - d) Not INDICATOR because explicit suicidal desire is present; it's not solely distress, metaphors, or rejected thoughts.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Ideation** fits: ""Active suicidal desire without actionable plan"" – the post shows a wish to die/kill self but no specifics on method, preparation, or timing. The vagueness of ""suitable way"" and lack of immediacy reinforce this.
- **Behavior** is excluded due to absence of method specificity, preparation, or imminent timeline.
- **Attempt** is excluded as no past actions are described.
- **Indicator** is inappropriate because the explicit suicidal desire (""want to kill myself"") goes beyond general distress or rejected thoughts.

**Irreducible Rules**:
1. Writer-focused: All content refers to the writer (""I"" statements).
2. Temporal hierarchy: Not triggered (no attempt or behavior).
3. Immediacy trumps: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") to override.
4. Rejection downgrade: ""can't find a suitable way"" indicates a barrier, not rejection (e.g., not ""I don't actually want to""), so no downgrade to indicator.
5. Output one category: IDEATION is the clear match.

   - Past actions: No mention of prior suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

   - Preparations: None described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Past actions: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to,"" ""attempted""). The mention of being ""molested at 5 years"" and life struggles is historical but unrelated to self-harm.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: No ownership of suicidal thoughts. The writer expresses a desire for relief (""take all thoughts away from my mind,"" ""do a miracle"") but frames it as wanting to be ""normal"" and free from suffering (e.g., ""take all gayness away,"" ""all depression""), not as a wish to die.
   - Passive experience: Intrusive thoughts are implied (""take all thoughts away""), but they are not specified as suicidal. The focus is on gender dysphoria, depression, and rejection, with no indication these thoughts are suicidal.
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal of suicide because suicide is not mentioned. The writer rejects their current state but does not reference or reject suicidal ideation.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: Describes historical distress (""molested at 5 years,"" ""always had unhappy life""), but no past suicide-related actions.
   - Present intent: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Future ideation: No future-oriented suicidal thoughts. The plea is for divine intervention to change circumstances, not for death.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) Past attempt? No → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy? No explicit suicide intent → Not BEHAVIOR.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy? No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.
   - d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts? Yes. The post shows general distress (unhappiness, depression, hopelessness) and metaphorical desires for escape (e.g., ""take all thoughts away,"" ""do a miracle""), but with no actionable suicide intent. Falls under INDICATOR per definition.

**Category Definitions Alignment**:
- **Indicator**: Matches due to distress (unhappiness, depression, despair) without suicidal desire. Metaphorical elements (e.g., wanting thoughts removed) are present but not death-related. Clarification: ""I'm going to die soon"" is absent, and no suicide context exists.

**Irreducible Rules Compliance**:
1. Writer-focused: Analysis ignores others; focuses solely on the writer's experiences.
2. Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, behavior, or ideation to override.
3. Immediacy trumps: No imminent timeline.
4. Rejection downgrade: Not applicable; no suicidal thoughts to reject.
5. Output exactly one category: INDICATOR is selected.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None. The phrase ""Anyone suicidal"" is a general question about others, not a self-statement.  
   - Indirect death references: None (e.g., no ""be gone"" or ""not wake up"").  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""no change in sight""), frustration (""doesn't matter what you do""), and distress over chronic pain.  
   - Specific methods/preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: No mention of personal suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - No active endorsement of personal suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""I want to die"").  
   - No passive experience of intrusive suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me to..."").  
   - The phrase ""Anyone suicidal"" is interrogative and externally focused, not a reflection of the writer’s state.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Focuses on present suffering (""it hurts,"" ""no change in sight"") and past duration (""been 8 months""). No future-oriented suicidal intent.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) No explicit personal suicide intent, method, or timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) No explicit personal desire to die (e.g., ""want to die"") → Not IDEATION.  
   - d) Distress/hopelessness present with no actionable suicide intent → INDICATOR.  

**Key Clarifications Applied**:  
- ""Anyone suicidal"" is a generalized question about others, not a self-report (Irreducible Rule 1: Writer-focused).  
- Hopelessness about pain qualifies as distress without suicidal intent (INDICATOR definition).  
- No rejection of suicidal thoughts needed since none were expressed.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future ideation: ""One last record... and its finally over"" implies non-imminent timing (after completing an action). No ""tonight""/""now"".  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - a) No past attempt described → **Not ATTEMPT**.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I want to die""

   - No rejection or disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"")  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:

   - ❌ No distress-only/rejected thoughts → not INDICATOR  

Key Boundaries Applied:  
- ""Want to die"" establishes active ideation.  
- Vague method (""wherever"") and lack of ""tonight""/""now"" prevent escalation to BEHAVIOR.  
- Revenge motive doesn’t override core suicidal intent.

My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**

   - Preparations: Rope-around-neck incident (interrupted action).  
   - Past actions: Multiple described attempts (age 11, 19, 24).  
   - Emotional markers: ""can't go on like this"", ""nobody"", ""full of rape, abuse and suffering"".  
   - Rejection noted: ""I'm a chicken"", ""failed because... friend wants dinner"", ""can't pull myself... and just do it"".  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement**: Clear ownership of suicidal thoughts (""I've been suicidale all my life"").

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - No explicit suicide references (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""suicide,"" ""end my life"").  
   - Indirect death references: ""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come,"" ""die at 50 or earlier."" These reflect passive acceptance of death rather than active pursuit.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""future is really grim""), worthlessness (""not worth pushing my life further"").  
   - No methods, preparations, or past actions described. Stopping doctor visits is framed as neglect/acceptance of natural death, not a suicide method.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Rejection noted**: Explicitly states, ""I don’t have any plans to end it."" The death references are contextualized as passive acceptance of natural mortality (""accept when my time has come"").  
   - **No active endorsement**: Desires are framed as resignation (""if I die then I die""), not ownership of suicidal intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present/future focus on non-actionable resignation: ""willing to accept when my time has come"" (vague, natural timeline). No immediacy (""tonight,"" ""now"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - No explicit suicide intent + no method/preparation/immediacy → Not **BEHAVIOR**.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is an explicit and direct reference to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present. ""Starve myself or something"" is contextually about weight loss struggles, not suicide.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of hopelessness and worthlessness (e.g., ""I just fucking hate myself,"" ""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy"").
- **Specific methods**: No specific suicide method described (e.g., pills, hanging). ""Starve myself"" is vague and tied to weight loss, not suicide.
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no words like ""tried"" or ""attempted""). The phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" implies inaction, not a past event.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer expresses ownership of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself""), but this is immediately countered by self-described cowardice, framing it as an unacted desire.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not presented as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" language); instead, they are self-directed but rejected.
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present through ""too much of a coward to kill myself,"" indicating the writer is unwilling or unable to act on the thoughts.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide attempts or actions.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). The rejection (""too coward to"") negates present intent.
- **Future ideation**: Suicidal desire (""kill myself"") is vague and non-specific, with no timeline attached.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt?**: No description of a past suicide attempt → Not ""Attempt.""
- **b) Behavior?**: Explicit suicide intent (""kill myself"") is present, but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline → Does not meet criteria for ""Behavior.""
- **c) Ideation?**: Explicit suicidal desire exists, but it is rejected (""too coward to"") and lacks a plan or immediacy. However, the rejection downgrades this per Rule 4.
- **d) Indicator?**: The core content involves distress (self-hate, hopelessness) and rejected suicidal thoughts, with no actionable suicide intent. This aligns with the Indicator category, which includes expressions of despair with explicit disavowal (e.g., ""brain tells me to kill myself but I don't want to"" is analogous to ""too coward to kill myself"").

**Final Decision**: Per Irreducible Rule 4 (""Rejection downgrade: 'I don't actually want to' → indicator""), the explicit rejection of action overrides the suicidal ideation. The post contains only distress, emotional markers, and disavowed thoughts, fitting the Indicator category.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present/future ideation: ""becoming content"" (ongoing), ""driving me further to killing myself"" (progressive), no specific timeline.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - → a) No past attempt described → *Not ATTEMPT*.  
   - → b) Explicit desire (""killing myself"") but **no specific method/preparation** (drinking/stopping meds are indirect) and **no immediate timeline** → *Not BEHAVIOR*.  
   - → c) Explicit suicide desire (""killing myself,"" ""time to die"") without plan/immediacy → **IDEATION**.  
   - → d) Distress present but overruled by explicit active desire.  

**Key Judgments**:  
- ""Becoming content with suicide"" and ""driving me further to killing myself"" confirm active suicidal ideation.  
- Preparatory acts (drinking, stopping meds) lack suicide-specific intent (framed as coping/self-sabotage).  
- No imminent timeline (""tonight,"" ""now"") or method details.  
- *Irreducible Rule 2*: Ideation takes precedence over indicator due to explicit desire.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as you see a light at the end of the tunnel. A nice smooth transition to death. If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION:**
   - Explicit suicide references: ""drowning yourself"" is a direct suicide reference, as it describes a method of self-harm. Phrases like ""guaranteed death"" and ""transition to death"" further reinforce suicidal intent.
   - Indirect death references: ""slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean"" and ""light at the end of the tunnel"" are metaphorical but clearly associated with death, though they are tied to the explicit method.
   - Emotional markers: The post implies hopelessness (e.g., ""best option for me"" in the context of potential homelessness), but no strong descriptors like ""worthless"" or ""unbearable pain"" are present.
   - Specific methods: Drowning is explicitly named as a method, with details like ""sinking to the bottom of the ocean"" and described as ""peaceful"" and a ""smooth transition.""
   - Preparations: No evidence of active preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations). The question ""Is drowning yourself painful?"" may indicate research, but it is not stated as a concrete step toward action.
   - Past actions: No mention of past suicide attempts (e.g., no words like ""tried"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Active endorsement: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts, using ""I"" statements like ""I think its the best option for me"" and ""I think I might go and do that."" This shows personal consideration and endorsement, not passive experience.
   - Passive experience: No indication that thoughts are intrusive or unwanted (e.g., no phrases like ""my brain tells me"").
   - Rejection noted: No explicit disavowal of suicidal intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The conditional ""might"" implies possibility rather than rejection.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK:**
   - Past focus: No references to past events or attempts.
   - Present intent: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"" is absent). The action is contingent on a future event (""If I get kicked out of my house"").
   - Future ideation: The suicidal thought is future-oriented and non-specific, hinging on a condition (""I think I might go and do that"" if kicked out), with no definitive timing.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE:**
   - Start: No past suicide attempt described → not ATTEMPT.
   - Check for explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline):
     - Explicit suicide intent is present (""drowning yourself,"" ""best option for me,"" ""guaranteed death"").
     - Specific method is stated (drowning).
     - However, no preparation evidence (e.g., no actions taken) and no immediate timeline (contingent on ""if I get kicked out,"" which is not imminent).
     - Despite the specific method, the lack of preparation or immediacy means this does not fully meet BEHAVIOR criteria. The key boundary states that BEHAVIOR requires immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") or preparation to elevate from IDEATION.
   - Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy: The post expresses a clear wish to die (""best option for me"") with a method, but no actionable plan (conditional ""might"" and no evidence of steps taken). This fits IDEATION, as the method is specified but not paired with immediacy or preparation.
   - Not INDICATOR, as there is active suicidal desire, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

**Final Classification Rationale:** The post contains explicit suicidal desire and a specific method, but the conditional future framing (""if I get kicked out... I might"") and lack of preparation or immediacy align with IDEATION per the category definitions. The decision tree prioritizes IDEATION when there is no imminent timeline or preparation, even with a method specified. Irreducible rules are applied: no rejection (Rule 4), no immediacy to trump (Rule 3), and temporal hierarchy (Rule 2) places IDEATION below BEHAVIOR but above INDICATOR.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" directly references suicide, including the word ""suicide"" and implies a plan.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness and worthlessness are evident: ""My parents don't love me,"" ""I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope',"" and ""I don't even know who I am anymore.""
- **Specific methods**: No details on methods (e.g., pills, hanging) are mentioned.
- **Preparations**: ""Possible suicide date is in July"" indicates planning (setting a timeline), but it lacks concrete evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations. The word ""possible"" introduces uncertainty.
- **Past actions**: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., no terms like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts through ""Possible suicide date is in July"" and ""I'm fucking debating it,"" showing personal engagement with the idea.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no phrasing like ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Ambivalence is present with ""debating it because of my friends"" and clinging to ""hope,"" but this is not an explicit disavowal (e.g., no statement like ""but I won't do it""). The hesitation does not negate active desire.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past events.
- **Present intent**: Current consideration is evident in ""I'm fucking debating it,"" but no immediate plan (e.g., ""tonight"").
- **Future ideation**: The specific timeline ""in July"" indicates future-oriented suicidal thinking, though it is not imminent (per framework, ""tonight"" or ""now"" would be immediate).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** → No, so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?** → Explicit intent is present (""Possible suicide date""), but:
  - No specific method mentioned.
  - Preparation is limited to a vague timeline (""in July"") with uncertainty (""possible""), which does not meet the threshold for concrete preparation (e.g., acquiring means).
  - Timeline is not immediate (per framework, ""in July"" is not equivalent to ""tonight"" or ""now"").
  → Does not qualify for BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → Yes: ""Possible suicide date"" and ""debating it"" express active suicidal desire, but there is no actionable plan or immediacy (method unspecified, timeline non-imminent, preparation vague).
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → No, because explicit suicide references exist, and rejection is not explicit (ambivalence like ""debating"" does not downgrade to INDICATOR per Rule 4).

**Category Selection Rationale**:
- Rule 1 (Writer-focused): All references are to the writer's own experience.
- Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy): No attempt or behavior, so IDEATION is applicable.
- Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): ""in July"" is not immediate, so does not elevate to BEHAVIOR.
- Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): Ambivalence (""debating"") is not explicit rejection (e.g., ""I don't actually want to""), so it does not downgrade to INDICATOR.
- Rule 5 (Output exactly one): IDEATION is the highest applicable category.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""have suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself,"" which are direct references to suicide.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"" or ""be gone"").
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I know I will always be a loser,"" ""will never make friends"") and emotional pain (""It hurts so much"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" language).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer acknowledges suicidal thoughts but explicitly rejects acting on them: ""I will probably never kill myself."" This disavowal is clear and ownership is denied.
- **Passive experience**: Suicidal thoughts are presented as intrusive reactions (""Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""), but they are framed as unwanted.
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is present: ""unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin."" This downgrades intent.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide-related actions.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""now""). Intent is explicitly rejected.
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific suicidal thoughts are mentioned, but they are negated by the rejection (""will probably never kill myself""), leaving only a hope for improvement (""can only hope that my life will get better"").

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** Explicit suicidal desire is present (""have suicidal thoughts""), but it lacks a specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Crucially, intent is rejected (""will probably never kill myself""), so it does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Suicidal desire is expressed but is rejected and lacks any plan or timeline. However, the rejection (""I will probably never kill myself"") triggers a downgrade per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade), so it does not qualify as IDEATION.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes: The core of the post is distress (hopelessness, worthlessness) with rejected suicidal thoughts. The phrase ""have suicidal thoughts... but I will probably never kill myself"" aligns with the INDICATOR definition of rejected/intrusive thoughts. No actionable suicide intent exists.
- **Temporal hierarchy and irreducibility**: No attempt, behavior, or active ideation overrules the rejection. Output must be exactly one category.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and ""suicide notes"" (directly mentioned in ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year"").
- **Indirect death references**: ""a great way to end an awful year"" and ""an amazing way to end it"" (contextually linked to suicide).
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life""), worthlessness (""i'm a fucking idiot""), and despair (""No one from my real life... just some random woman"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., no details like pills or jumping).
- **Preparations**: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"" (evidence of repeated note-writing, a clear preparation step).
- **Past actions**: No description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no phrases like ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" regarding self-harm; notes are preparatory, not an action).

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" and affirms the plan with ""this is the one"" (no distancing language).
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts; the tone is deliberate and resigned.
- **Rejection noted**: No disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""); instead, the plan is reinforced.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: References to past events (e.g., making previous suicide notes, relationship failures), but no past suicide attempt.
- **Present intent**: Current expression of intent (""I'm thinking of ending it all"") and exhaustion (""I can't fucking do another year"").
- **Future ideation**: Specific timeline with ""on new year's eve,"" indicating an imminent plan (within days or weeks, depending on posting date, making it actionable and near-term).

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past suicide attempt?** No. Mentions preparations (suicide notes) but no description of actual self-harm with intent (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" actions). → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""I'm thinking of ending it all"").
  - Preparation: Yes (repeated suicide note writing, with ""this is the one"" indicating current readiness).
  - Immediacy: Yes (""on new year's eve"" is a specific, imminent timeline, similar to ""tonight"" or ""this weekend"" in urgency).
  - → Criteria met for BEHAVIOR (intent + preparation + immediacy).
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as preparation and timeline are present.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to explicit suicidal intent and preparation.

### Category Alignment
- **Behavior**: Fits due to explicit intent (""ending it all""), evidence of preparation (suicide notes), and imminent timeline (""new year's eve""). The framework specifies that ""expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details,"" and note-writing is a key preparation indicator.
- **Not Ideation**: Though there is explicit desire (""want to die"" equivalent), it is paired with preparation and a timeline, crossing the boundary into behavior.
- **Not Attempt**: No past self-harm actions described.
- **Not Indicator**: Suicidal intent is active and not rejected; distress is present but secondary to actionable plans.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: All content refers to the writer's own experiences.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt mentioned, so behavior takes precedence.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: ""on new year's eve"" establishes urgency, overriding non-specific ideation.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal; intent is confirmed.
5. **Output exactly one**: Behavior is the clearest fit.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: None (""cut myself"" implies self-harm but lacks suicide-specific terms like ""kill myself"").  
   - Indirect death references: None.  
   - Emotional markers: Distress (""breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" ""wanted to feel something real"").  
   - Specific methods: ""Cut myself"" (method mentioned but contextualized as non-suicidal).  
   - Preparations: None described.  
   - Past actions: **""tried to cut myself last night""** (explicit past action).  
   - Key negation: ""I've **never done it or wanted to do it before**"" (rejects prior intent/pattern).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: Temporarily present during the incident (""wanted to feel something real"") but framed as situational (drunk, breakdown).  
   - Rejection noted: **Explicit disavowal** (""never wanted to do it before"") and frames the act as isolated.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past focus**: Action occurred ""last night""; no current/imminent plans.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start → **a) Any past suicide attempt?**  
     - ""Tried to cut myself"" is a past self-harm action.  
     - **But**: Requires suicidal intent per Attempt definition (""actual self-harm **with suicidal intent**"").  
     - Writer clarifies intent: ""wanted to feel something real"" (not to die) and rejects prior desire.  
     - → *Does not meet Attempt criteria* (no suicidal intent indicated).  
   - Proceed to lower categories:  
     - No active suicide desire, plans, or timeline → **Not Ideation/Behavior**.  
     - Distress + metaphorical self-harm (""feel something real"") + rejected intent → **INDICATOR**.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused: Yes (ignores ""tell my friend"").  
- Temporal hierarchy: Past action without suicidal intent doesn’t trigger Attempt.  
- Rejection downgrade: Explicit disavowal (""never wanted to"") supports downgrade to Indicator.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""plan to kill myself"" (direct statement of intent).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""no purpose to live""), worthlessness (""i have nothing and no one"").  
   - No indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past attempts identified.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership (""*I* plan to kill myself"").  
   - No rejection or disavowal (rhetorical ""Why shouldn't i?"" implies consideration, not refusal).  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: ""plan to kill myself"" indicates current ideation.  
   - No specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight""), method, or preparation mentioned.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""plan to kill myself"") but lacks:  
     - Specific method/preparation (e.g., ""pills,"" ""wrote note"").  
     - Imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").  
   → Matches IDEATION criteria: Active desire without actionable plan or immediacy.  
   - Emotional distress (hopelessness) supports context but doesn’t override explicit suicidal desire.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No higher-priority elements (Attempt/Behavior) override.

463,"Is it better to let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon or just surprise em will h it?. Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped. Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains direct references to suicide, such as ""killing yourself soon"" and ""killing myself"" (implied in context). The phrase ""will h it"" appears to be a typo for ""will hit it,"" meaning ""will go through with it,"" reinforcing the suicide focus.
- **Indirect death references**: None present; all references are explicit.
- **Emotional markers**: Hopelessness and worthlessness are evident in ""Nobodyll do shit so I have no worries of being stopped,"" indicating a belief that no one cares or will intervene.
- **Specific methods**: No specific method (e.g., pills, firearms) is mentioned.
- **Preparations**: The writer is actively considering logistical preparations, specifically whether to inform others (""let folks know you'll be killing yourself soon""), which is analogous to writing a suicide note or planning communication as part of the act.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts, using direct language like ""killing yourself soon"" in a personal context (rephrased as ""I'll be killing myself soon""). There is no indication of passive or intrusive thoughts.
- **Rejection noted?**: No explicit disavowal; the writer discusses the suicide as inevitable, with no statements like ""but I won't do it.""

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Absent; no historical descriptions.
- **Present intent**: The use of ""soon"" implies impending action, though it lacks specificity (e.g., not ""tonight""). The discussion of informing others suggests the act is being planned for the near future.
- **Future ideation**: Strong future orientation with non-specific timing (""soon""), but the focus on logistics elevates it beyond vague ideation.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** → No, so not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)** → 
  - Explicit intent is present (""killing yourself soon"").
  - Specific method is absent.
  - **Preparation is present**: Considering whether to inform others is evidence of planning, similar to ""writing notes"" in the framework.
  - Imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is not specified; ""soon"" is vague but, combined with preparation, supports actionable intent.
  - → Proceed to BEHAVIOR based on explicit intent + preparation evidence.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy** → Not applicable, as preparation evidence exists.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts** → Not applicable, due to explicit intent and preparation.

### Category Alignment
- **Behavior definition**: Matches due to explicit suicidal intent (""want to die"" equivalent) plus preparation evidence (planning communication). The framework clarifies that ""writing notes"" qualifies as preparation, and ""expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details."" Here, ""soon"" is not highly specific but, with preparation, indicates capability and intent.
- **Not Ideation**: Ideation requires no preparation or immediacy, but preparation is evident.
- **Not Attempt**: No past actions described.
- **Not Indicator**: Explicit suicidal desire is present, not just distress or rejected thoughts.

### Irreducible Rules Check
1. **Writer-focused**: The post uses ""you"" generically but is clearly self-referential; ignore any hypothetical others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt, so Behavior takes precedence over Ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: ""Soon"" lacks high immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), but preparation compensates per Behavior criteria.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No rejection; intent is affirmed.
5. **Single output**: Behavior is the clearest fit.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""kill myself tonight"", ""want to kill myself so bad""  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself at the woods""  
   - Preparation: ""play my favorite music ever"" (ritualistic preparation)  
   - Emotional markers: ""tired of everything"" (hopelessness), profanity (distress)  
   - No past attempts described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I want to kill myself so bad"" (ownership of intent)  
   - No rejection or disavowal present  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**

I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way. I want to kill myself, already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching. Already started to cancel friendships.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I want to kill myself"" is a direct statement.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""truly alone forever"", ""struggled daily with loneliness"", ""What a joke"") and worthlessness.
   - Preparations: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago"" (specific planning) and ""Already started to cancel friendships"" (tying up affairs).
   - No specific method mentioned (e.g., pills, firearms), no indirect death references, and no past suicide attempt described (e.g., ""tried to"" refers to finding solace in activities, not self-harm).

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Active endorsement: ""I want to kill myself"" shows direct ownership of suicidal thoughts, with no passive framing or disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past: Setting a date 2 weeks ago indicates past preparation.
   - Present: ""I'm approaching"" the date shows current progression toward the plan.
   - Future: The set date implies a specific imminent timeline (within days/weeks), not vague ideation.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - No past suicide attempt described (e.g., no ""tried to kill myself"") → not ATTEMPT.
   - Explicit suicide intent (""I want to kill myself"") paired with preparation evidence (set date, canceling friendships) → BEHAVIOR per the rule: ""Preparation evidence: bought pills, wrote note"" or ""Imminent timeline: 'tonight', 'right now', 'this weekend'"". Here, ""set a date"" and ""approaching"" constitute preparation and an imminent timeline (similar to ""this weekend"" in specificity), even without method details.
   - Not IDEATION because the explicit desire includes a plan (date) and preparation, moving beyond non-actionable thoughts.
   - Not INDICATOR due to active suicidal desire and lack of rejection (e.g., no disavowal like ""but I won't do it"").

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" in the phrases: ""so i dont kill myself"" and ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look.""
- **Indirect death references**: ""its just death"" is mentioned, but it is directly tied to the suicide reference, so it is not purely indirect.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong distress and hopelessness are present, e.g., ""This life doesnt fit me. It never did,"" ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it,"" indicating feelings of being trapped and unfulfilled.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of any suicide method (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to,"" ""attempted,"" or similar language). The phrase ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" implies avoidance of action, not a past event.

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: The writer does not explicitly claim ownership of active suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die""). Instead, suicidal thoughts are presented in the context of avoidance (""so i dont kill myself"") and philosophical questioning (""Is suicide really as bad...""), suggesting lack of current intent.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are not framed as intrusive (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"").
- **Rejection noted**: Explicit disavowal is evident through behavioral avoidance (""i have to so i dont kill myself""), indicating the writer is actively rejecting suicidal action.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicide attempts or actions.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans or imminent action (e.g., no ""tonight,"" ""now,"" or specific timing).
- **Future ideation**: Non-specific references to suicide exist (e.g., ""kill myself"" and the general question about suicide), but these are not tied to a plan or timeline and are counteracted by rejection.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?**: No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (method/prep OR immediacy)?**: No explicit intent for action (desire is questioned or avoided), no specific method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?**: While ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" are explicit references, they are not presented as active desire (e.g., no ""I want to die""). The context shows avoidance and questioning, with no plan or immediacy. However, the rejection (avoidance behavior) suggests this is not pure ideation.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: Yes. The core content involves general distress (life not fitting, dislike of circumstances), metaphorical elements (e.g., ""kill myself"" used in a preventive context), and rejected thoughts (explicit avoidance via behavior: ""i have to so i dont kill myself""). The suicide references are philosophical and disavowed, with no actionable intent.

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION
1. **Writer-focused**: All content is about the writer; no mentions of others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt (rules out ATTEMPT), no immediacy (rules out BEHAVIOR), and rejection downgrades any potential ideation.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No terms like ""tonight,"" so no elevation to BEHAVIOR.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: ""i have to so i dont kill myself"" constitutes explicit behavioral rejection, downgrading to INDICATOR.
5. **Output exactly one category**: INDICATOR is the best fit, as the post shows distress and suicidal references but with clear rejection and no actionable intent.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die"" (repeated twice) indicates a direct expression of suicidal desire.  
   - Indirect death references: None present (e.g., no phrases like ""not wake up"").  
   - Emotional markers: Implied hopelessness/self-deprecation (""too much of a coward""), but no explicit descriptors like ""worthless"" or ""unbearable pain"".

   - Passive experience: Not present; thoughts are stated directly, not as intrusive.  
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal of action (""too much of a coward to do it""), indicating the writer will not act on the desire despite the wish to die.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) Explicit suicide intent present, but lacks specific method/preparation or immediate timeline (and includes rejection) → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - c) Explicit suicide desire, but rejection (""too much of a coward to do it"") downgrades it per Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""throw myself off a bridge,"" ""this is just a way of dying.""  
   - Emotional markers: ""I cant take it,"" ""hated myself,"" ""tired of everything,"" lack of confidence.

   - Preparations: ""Ive planned it all out,"" isolating in bathroom, anticipating final messages.  
   - Past actions: ""been suicidal since 9,"" ""self-harmed"" (historical context).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active ownership: ""i littitimatly decide to throw myself,"" ""this is just a way of dying"" (no disavowal).  
   - No rejection: Writer expresses resolve (""at peace"") rather than hesitation.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Imminent timeline: ""last vent before [action],"" ""last few seconds"" indicates immediate intent.  
   - Present focus: Current isolation (""locked in bathroom"") and final communication.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:

   - **Explicit intent** (""throw myself off a bridge"") + **specific method** (bridge) + **preparations** (""planned it all out"") + **immediacy** (""last few seconds"") → **BEHAVIOR**.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""commit suicide""  
   - Specific method: ""twist my dick off"" (self-harm method) + ""die of blood loss"" (predicted outcome)  
   - Preparation/timeline: ""gonna wait it off"" (enduring the act until death)  
   - No rejection noted: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't"")  
   - Emotional markers: Distress implied but secondary to action plan  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I’m gonna commit suicide"" shows direct ownership of intent.  
   - No passive framing or disclaimers.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Present/future immediacy: ""gonna try here"" implies initiation of action. ""Gonna wait it off"" suggests ongoing process toward death.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit intent (""commit suicide"") + specific method (""twist my dick off""/blood loss) + implied immediacy (""here"") → BEHAVIOR.  
   - Overrules IDEATION due to method specificity and action initiation.  

**Key Considerations**:  
- Method is highly specific and violent, demonstrating capability.  
- ""Gonna try here"" indicates commencement, satisfying immediacy requirement (Rule 3).  
- Crude language doesn’t invalidate risk; context shows actionable intent.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: None. Phrases like ""suicide"", ""kill myself"", ""end my life"", or ""not want to live"" are absent.
- **Indirect death references**: ""I will eventually die in a much painful way"" references death, but it is tied to disease progression, not self-inflicted harm. ""Sayonara"" (meaning ""goodbye"") is metaphorical and could imply departure, but it is not a direct or actionable death reference.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""I am lonely and have no reason to live""), worthlessness (""no reason to live""), and unbearable pain (""endured the physical pain and mental depression for years"", ""disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker"").
- **Specific methods**: None mentioned (e.g., pills, hanging, firearms).
- **Preparations**: None described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Past actions**: No references to past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"", ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS
- **Active endorsement**: No expressions of personal suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The statement ""I have no reason to live"" conveys despair but not active intent to act.
- **Passive experience**: Thoughts are presented as situational (due to disease and pain), not as intrusive suicidal thoughts.
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""but I won't do it""). The focus is on enduring suffering, not rejecting or endorsing suicide.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: Describes enduring pain and depression for years, but no past suicide actions.
- **Present intent**: No current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
- **Future ideation**: ""I will eventually die"" is future-oriented but non-specific and contextually tied to disease, not suicide. It lacks actionable suicidal timing.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- Start → 
  - a) **Past attempt described?** No mention of any suicide attempt (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted""), so not ATTEMPT.
  - b) **Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** No explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""want to die""), no specific method, no preparation, and no immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). Thus, not BEHAVIOR.
  - c) **Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""don't deserve to live"" is not stated; ""no reason to live"" indicates hopelessness but not active suicidal desire). Thus, not IDEATION.
  - d) **ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Yes. The post contains:
    - General distress: Hopelessness, worthlessness, loneliness, and despair due to disease.
    - Metaphorical death references: ""Sayonara"" and ""I will eventually die"" are metaphorical or contextual (natural death from illness), with no suicidal context.
    - No rejected thoughts, but the absence of actionable suicide intent aligns with INDICATOR.
  - *Key clarification from rules*: ""I'm going to die soon"" without explicit suicide context → INDICATOR. Here, ""I will eventually die"" is similar—it references natural death, not suicide.

### IRREDUCIBLE RULES CHECK
1. **Writer-focused**: All content is about the writer's experience; no mentions of others.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No attempt, behavior, or ideation elements override.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") present.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Not applicable, as no suicidal thoughts are rejected or endorsed.
5. **Output exactly one category**: INDICATOR is the highest applicable category based on distress without actionable suicide intent.

473,"I'm 14 and the only thing keeping me alive is my little brother. For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'. I don't know how long I can cope with this anymore, especially with schools re-opening, knowing my teachers will be very hard on us because of on-line school. I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""thought of killing myself multiple times""  
   - Emotional markers: ""crushed by stress,"" ""cried myself to sleep,"" ""no motivation,"" ""bottled up,"" ""don't know how long I can cope""  
   - Preparations/actions: None described (no methods, plans, or past attempts)  
   - Rejection noted: ""but I always thought of my little brother [as a reason to live]""  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement of suicidal thoughts: Explicitly states ownership (""*I* thought of killing myself"").  
   - Rejection element: Protective factor (little brother) is actively preventing action, though no explicit disavowal (e.g., ""I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past focus: Ideation occurred over the past 2 years (""thought of killing myself multiple times"" historically).  
   - Present/future: Current distress (""getting much worse"") but no imminent timeline or plan.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - ❌ No past attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - ❌ Explicit desire (""want to die"") is implied but lacks:  
     - Specific method/preparation (e.g., ""pills,"" ""note"").  
     - Imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now""). → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - ✅ Explicit suicidal desire (""thought of killing myself"") + no plan/immediacy → IDEATION.  
   - ❌ Not *only* distress/metaphors (explicit suicide ideation overrides).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Suicidal ideation is actively owned and historical/recurrent but lacks current plan/timeline.  
- Protective factor (brother) diminishes immediacy but doesn’t negate active desire (rejection is situational, not explicit disavowal like ""I’d never do it"").  
- ""I don’t know how long I can cope"" expresses desperation but not actionable intent.

  - Preparation: Information-seeking **not** equivalent to acquiring means/writing note  
  - Immediacy: **No** timeline → *fails criteria*

**Key Boundaries Applied:**  
- Information-seeking alone ≠ ""preparation evidence"" per framework (requires concrete actions like acquiring means).  
- ""I don't care if it's slow/painful"" implies openness to methods but lacks specificity (e.g., ""pills"" or ""jumping"").  
- Absence of temporal urgency (""tonight"") prevents escalation to BEHAVIOR.

- **Methods**: None specified

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS:**
- **Active endorsement**: Strong ownership of desire (""I just don't want [a future]"", ""will to die"")
- **Rejection noted?**: No disavowal of intent. ""I'm not in immediate danger"" acknowledges risk but doesn't reject ideation.

- *Decision halts here* – Attempt overrides concurrent ideation/behavior mentions.

**Key Considerations:**
- Writer explicitly references past attempts → overrules all other elements.
- ""I'm not in immediate danger"" doesn't negate attempt classification (per rules).
- Future intent (""if I do attempt"") reinforces attempt history but doesn't override category.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""take my life"", ""I don't want to live""  
   - Specific methods: ""gun to the head"", ""grab a kitchen knife and do it""  
   - Preparations: Detailed plan/timeline (""wait another 480 days""), consideration of alternative method (knife)  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""won't live a comfortable life""), worthlessness (""fucked up everything""), unbearable pain (""pain to stop"")  
   - No past attempts described  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active ownership: ""I'm going to take my life"", ""I just want the pain to stop""  
   - No rejection: Urgency (""can't wait any more"") without disavowal  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future ideation: 480-day gun plan  
   - Present intent: Daily knife temptation (""Each day I've been more tempted"") with immediacy (""do it there"")

   - No past attempt → **Not ATTEMPT**  
   - Explicit intent + (specific method *and* immediacy):  
     - Kitchen knife = specific method  
     - ""Each day... tempted to just grab"" + ""can't wait"" = imminent risk → **BEHAVIOR**

I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live, and figure out what steps to take. It just feels like everyone in my life is focused on their career goals and I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live with all I failed to do",0,indicator,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains one reference to ""thoughts of suicide,"" but it is framed as a general question about others (""Did anyone having thoughts of suicide...""), not a direct statement from the writer. No phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end my life"" are used.
- **Indirect death references**: None present (e.g., no ""not wake up,"" ""be gone,"" or similar).
- **Emotional markers**: Strong indicators of distress, including hopelessness (""I can't concentrate on anything except convincing myself I deserve to live""), worthlessness (""with all I failed to do""), and feelings of isolation (""everyone in my life is focused on their career goals"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"" in a suicidal context). The phrase ""all I failed to do"" refers to life failures, not suicidal behavior.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: No ownership of suicidal intent. The writer does not state ""I want to die"" or similar. Instead, they explicitly express a desire to live (""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"").
- **Passive experience**: Suicidal thoughts are referenced indirectly through a question about others, but not described as intrusive or involuntary for the writer.
- **Rejection noted**: Strong explicit disavowal of suicidal intent is present. The writer emphasizes active efforts toward living (e.g., ""trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live""), which directly rejects and downgrades any suicidal thoughts to distress.

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: No references to past suicidal actions.
- **Present intent**: No indication of current plans or immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The writer discusses seeking help (inpatient care, medication) and life steps, not suicide.
- **Future ideation**: No non-specific suicidal timing (e.g., ""someday""). Focus is on future-oriented positive actions (e.g., ""figure out what steps to take"" for living).

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past attempt described?** → No, so not 'attempt'.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + method/preparation/immediacy?** → No explicit suicide intent from the writer (only a general question about others). No method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Rejection of intent is clear. Thus, not 'behavior'.
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** → No explicit wish to die (e.g., ""want to die""). The writer's language centers on wanting to live, and any suicidal thoughts are rejected or contextualized as part of distress. Thus, not 'ideation'.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** → Yes. The post shows general distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphorical struggle (""convincing myself I deserve to live""), and rejected thoughts (seeking help to live). The ""thoughts of suicide"" reference is downgraded due to disavowal and lack of ownership.

### Irreducible Rules Application
1. **Writer-focused**: The ""thoughts of suicide"" mention is about others (question format) and not claimed by the writer. Focus remains on the writer's own expressed distress and rejection of suicide.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: Not triggered (no attempt, behavior, or ideation present).
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No immediacy.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: Explicit disavowal (""trying to find the courage to actually live"") moves any potential ideation to indicator.
5. **Output exactly one**: Category is 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday.""  
   - Specific method: ""Bridge"" (implies jumping from a bridge).  
   - Preparation/timeline: Explicit plan for ""Monday"" (specific future timing) and method scouting (""Bridge"").  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""No future,"" ""Everyday is the same,"" ""unemployed""), but these are secondary to actionable statements.  
   - No past attempts, disavowals, or references to others.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I'm really going to try"" shows direct ownership of intent. No rejection (e.g., no ""but I won’t"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Future intent: ""on Monday"" specifies a near-future timeline (not immediate like ""tonight,"" but concrete).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit suicide intent (""kill myself"") + specific method (""Bridge"") + preparation (stating time/method) → BEHAVIOR.  
   - ""Monday"" is a defined timeline (not hypothetical), overriding non-immediate phrasing.  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES**  
- Writer-focused: All references are self-directed.  
- Temporal hierarchy: No attempt, but behavior criteria met.  
- Immediacy: ""Monday"" is specific and actionable (not ""someday"").  
- No rejection to downgrade.

- **Past actions**: None (only ideation/preparation)  
- **Rejection?**: No disavowal (e.g., ""Not cool to start something and then just kms"" implies intent, not refusal).  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: ""kms,"" ""when I do it,"" ""stay on track"" show ownership of intent.  
- **No rejection**: Rationalizes delay (""Not cool to start something...""), but doesn’t reject the act.

- **Present preparation**: ""Set my wallpaper..."" (current action reinforcing intent).  
- **Future timeline**: ""when I do it"" (non-immediate but planned).

  - Specific method: ""hangman's noose.""

- **Irreducible Rules**:  
  - Writer-focused: All ""I"" statements.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: ""I want to die"" is explicit, but later contradicted by ""I don't want to die"".
   - Indirect death references: ""I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born"" and ""I've seen enough of my future to want to continue"" imply non-existence or not wanting to live, but not direct death references.
   - Emotional markers: Strong hopelessness (""my adulthood is all downhill from here""), worthlessness (""I'm a failure,"" ""I'm not good at anything""), and unbearable pain (""stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain,"" ""anxiety that I have to quit"").
   - Specific methods: None mentioned (e.g., no pills, hanging, etc.).
   - Preparations: None described (e.g., no note-writing, acquiring means).
   - Past actions: No mention of suicide attempts; only references to depression diagnosis and general life struggles.

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**:
   - Active endorsement: The initial ""I want to die"" suggests active suicidal desire, but this is explicitly rejected later with ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" The rejection clarifies that suicidal thoughts are not actively endorsed.
   - Passive experience: Thoughts are described as intrusive and distressing (""I wanna stop hearing my thoughts""), but not framed as involuntary suicidal urges.
   - Rejection noted: Explicit disavowal with ""I don't want to die"" downgrades the initial expression to rejected thoughts, indicating distress rather than actionable intent.

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: References to 2 years of unhappiness and past struggles, but no suicide-related actions.
   - Present intent: No indication of immediate plans or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: Non-specific expressions like ""my adulthood is all downhill"" and ""seen enough of my future to want to continue,"" but these are vague and lack immediacy.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""I want to die"") is present, but no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. Crucially, intent is rejected (""I don't want to die"") → Does not meet BEHAVIOR criteria.
   - c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy might apply, but the rejection downgrades this to INDICATOR per Rule 4 (rejection downgrade).
   - d) Distress (hopelessness, worthlessness), metaphors (""don't want to be me anymore""), and rejected thoughts dominate → INDICATOR.

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES APPLICATION**:
- Rule 2 (Temporal hierarchy): Not applicable, as no attempt or behavior is present.
- Rule 3 (Immediacy trumps): No immediacy (e.g., ""tonight""), so not behavior.
- Rule 4 (Rejection downgrade): ""I don't want to die"" explicitly disavows suicidal intent, downgrading any ideation to indicator.
- Rule 5: Output one category → INDICATOR is the best fit.

**CONCLUSION**: The post expresses suicidal ideation but explicitly rejects acting on it, focusing on distress, hopelessness, and a desire to escape the self without death. It aligns with INDICATOR per the framework.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

   - **Indirect death references**: ""be gone"" (implied), ""exit bag""  
   - **Emotional markers**: ""scared,"" ""lonely,"" ""exhausted,"" ""empty,"" ""despair""  
   - **Specific methods**: Exit bag, pills (120 aspirin), gun (""aim at head""), partial suspension hanging  
   - **Preparations**: Made exit bag, purchased gun/rope, researched methods, scouted locations  
   - **Past actions**:  
     * At 15: Took 120 aspirin pills (hospitalized)  
     * At 21: Attempted gun suicide (trigger malfunction → hospitalized)  
     * Recently: Attempted partial hanging (aborted due to pain)  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - **Active endorsement**: Claims ownership (""I've made an exit bag,"" ""I purchased rope/gun,"" ""desire to die"").  
   - **Rejection noted?**: Fear of pain/failure (""scared of dying"") but no disavowal of intent.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - **Past focus**: Three detailed suicide attempts (ages 15/21/recent).  
   - **Present intent**: Exit bag prepared and tested (""turned that gas valve""), though aborted due to panic. No explicit imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

- **No indirect death references, specific methods, preparations, or past actions**  

**2. INTENT ANALYSIS**  
- **Active endorsement**: ""should just end my life"" demonstrates ownership of suicidal desire (not passive/intrusive).  
- **No rejection noted**: Absence of disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t"").  

**3. TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
- **Future ideation**: ""should end my life"" implies consideration without specific timing (e.g., no ""tonight"").

   - No methods/preparations mentioned, no past actions described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I’m about to kill myself"" shows direct ownership of intent.

486,"What about a retirement plan?. I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it but I want experience a few more things before I do. im unsure how long that will take maybe in my 20's or 30's.

If I wait 10 years I'll never be able to retire. but why should I save up so much money only leaving myself enough to get by if I plan to be dead long before I retire. I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
### Step 1: Content Deconstruction
- **Explicit suicide references**: The post contains ""I have contemplated suicide for years"" and ""I know I am going to do it,"" which are direct acknowledgments of suicidal thoughts.
- **Indirect death references**: Phrases like ""be dead long before I retire"" imply death but are contextualized within the suicide discussion.
- **Emotional markers**: Expressions of hopelessness and worthlessness are present, e.g., ""why should I save up so much money... if I plan to be dead,"" indicating despair about the future.
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, firearms) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of active preparations for suicide; the focus is on retirement planning as a life decision.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts; ""contemplated suicide"" refers to thoughts, not actions. The word ""tried"" is not used in a suicidal context.

### Step 2: Intent Analysis
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal thoughts with statements like ""I know I am going to do it,"" indicating personal intent without ambiguity.
- **Passive experience or rejection**: No presentation of thoughts as intrusive or unwanted. Crucially, there is no disavowal (e.g., no phrases like ""but I won't do it""). Instead, the intent is affirmed with a qualifier about timing (""I want to experience a few more things before I do"").

### Step 3: Temporal Framework
- **Past focus**: References to ""contemplated suicide for years"" describe historical ideation, but no past actions are reported.
- **Present intent**: Suicidal intent is stated as current (""I know I am going to do it""), but the timeline for action is explicitly delayed and non-immediate.
- **Future ideation**: The suicide is planned for an indefinite future timeframe (""maybe in my 20's or 30's""), with no immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now""). The phrase ""right now"" is used only in the context of retirement planning, not suicide.

### Step 4: Category Decision Tree
- **a) Past suicide attempt?**: No—mentions of ""contemplated"" refer to thoughts, not actions. → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit intent + method/preparation/immediacy?**: Explicit intent (""I know I am going to do it"") is present, but there is no specific method, preparation, or immediate timeline. The future-oriented timing (""in my 20's or 30's"") lacks imminence. → Not BEHAVIOR.
- **c) Explicit desire without plan/immediacy?**: Yes—explicit suicidal desire is expressed (""I know I am going to do it""), but it lacks actionable details (method, preparation) and immediacy. The timeline is vague and delayed. → Matches IDEATION.
- **d) Only distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?**: No—explicit suicidal desire is present, and there is no rejection or framing as intrusive thoughts. General distress about retirement is secondary and does not override the active suicidal ideation.

### Irreducible Rules Application
1. **Writer-focused**: Analysis centers solely on the writer's own statements; no references to others' actions.
2. **Temporal hierarchy**: No past attempt or current behavior with immediacy, so IDEATION takes precedence.
3. **Immediacy trumps**: No imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"")—delayed timing (""in my 20's or 30's"") confirms IDEATION.
4. **Rejection downgrade**: No disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't do it"")—intent is actively endorsed.
5. **Single output**: One category must be selected based on the hierarchy.

**Conclusion**: The post expresses clear suicidal desire with future-oriented, non-specific timing and no actionable plan or preparations, fitting the IDEATION category. Retirement-related distress does not alter this classification.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:
   - Explicit suicide references: The phrase ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" is an inquiry about death by overdose, but it is phrased as a question rather than a direct statement like ""I want to kill myself."" The word ""you"" in this context is interpreted as self-referential based on the writer-focused rule, making it an indirect but clear reference to suicide.
   - Indirect death references: ""kill you"" is a direct death reference, though framed as a question.
   - Emotional markers: No expressions of hopelessness, worthlessness, or unbearable pain are present.
   - Specific methods: Duloxetine (an antidepressant) is mentioned as a potential method via pill overdose.
   - Preparations: ""I have a few pills that I've been saving for later"" explicitly indicates acquisition and retention of means (pills) for potential future use, which constitutes preparation.
   - Past actions: No descriptions of past suicide attempts (e.g., ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)**:
   - Active endorsement: The writer does not explicitly claim ownership of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""). However, the combination of inquiring about lethality (""Can duloxetine kill you?"") and saving pills demonstrates engagement with suicidal ideas, implying intent. There is no passive framing (e.g., ""my brain tells me"") or explicit rejection (e.g., ""but I won't do it"").

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:
   - Past focus: No past actions are described.
   - Present intent: Preparation (saving pills) is current, but the timeline ""for later"" is non-specific and not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""now"").
   - Future ideation: The phrase ""saving for later"" indicates a future-oriented plan without immediacy.

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:
   - Start → 
     - a) No past suicide attempt described → Not ATTEMPT.
     - b) Explicit suicide intent? The post lacks direct statements like ""I want to die,"" so explicit intent is not met. However, specific method (pills) and preparation (saving pills",ideation,True

   - Explicit suicide references: **None** (""end"" is ambiguous; could imply cessation of suffering rather than suicide).  
   - Indirect death references: **""I just want to end""** (metaphorical, non-specific).  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (**""No one cares about my life""**), worthlessness (**""it isn't me. Not anymore""**), distress (**""hell""**, **""out of place""**).  
   - Methods/preparations: **None**.  
   - Past actions: **None** (""haven't yet"" implies no attempt).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Passive experience**: Suffering is described (**""I feel so empty""**), but no active ownership of suicidal intent.  
   - **Rejection noted**: **""haven't yet""** implies hesitation but lacks explicit disavowal (e.g., ""but I won't"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present-focused distress (**""Today’s a great day. It’s hell""**), but **no timeline** for action.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt → Not **ATTEMPT**.  
   - b) No explicit suicidal intent/method/immediacy → Not **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) **No explicit suicidal desire** (e.g., ""want to die"" or ""kill myself""); ""want to end"" is metaphorical → Not **IDEATION**.  
   - d) **Distress + metaphors** (""want to end"") + **no actionable intent** → **INDICATOR**.

Final Classification: **indicator**  

**Key Justifications**:  
- ""Want to end"" is a vague metaphor (similar to ""disappear"") without suicidal specificity.  
- Hopelessness/distress dominates, but lacks:  
  - Explicit suicidal desire (""die"", ""suicide"").  
  - Plan, method, timeline, or preparation.  
- ""Haven’t yet"" suggests contemplation but **not** active intent or rejection strong enough to override distress signals.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide reference: ""could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""can't off myself"".  
   - Indirect death reference: None beyond explicit terms.  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""Fatigue is usually considered...""), worthlessness implied.  
   - Specific method: Mention of ""buy the gas"" (likely carbon monoxide poisoning).  
   - Preparation: None executed (""I never leave the house to go buy the gas"").  
   - Past actions: None described (""thinking"" is hypothetical).  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" shows ownership of intent.  
   - Passive experience/rejection: Procrastination/fatigue prevents action, but **no explicit disavowal** (e.g., no ""I won’t do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: ""by the end of the day today"" specifies immediacy.  
   - Future ideation: Hypothetical scenario (""if I never leave..."").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt → Not **Attempt**.  
   - b) Explicit intent (""dead by end of day"") + imminent timeline (""today"") → **Behavior** (per rule: ""Immediacy trumps"").  
   - c) Ideation excluded due to presence of timeline.  
   - d) Not applicable (intent is active and endorsed).  

**IRREDUCIBLE RULES**:  
- Writer-focused: All statements are self-referential (""I"").  
- Temporal hierarchy: Immediacy (""today"") elevates to Behavior.  
- Rejection: Fatigue delays action but doesn’t reject intent → no downgrade.

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""do it"" (repeated twice in context of suicidal posting history).  
   - Emotional markers: Self-criticism (""stop being a pussy,"" ""suck it up""), frustration with inaction.  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or past attempts described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Ownership is clear (""I should just suck it up and do it""). Urgency is implied through ""already.""  
   - **Rejection?**: No disavowal; instead, self-pressure to act.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Present intent: Urgent call to action (""do it already"") implies immediacy.  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - Explicit intent (""do it"") + immediacy (""already"") → BEHAVIOR (per rule: ""immediacy trumps"" and ""expressions of immediate intent qualify"").  
   - No downgrade (no rejection of intent).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- ""Do it already"" converts non-specific ideation into actionable intent, meeting BEHAVIOR criteria despite lacking method/preparation details.

### Step 1: CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION
- **Explicit suicide references**: ""pls fucking end me"" is a direct plea for death, and ""im going to do it"" implies suicidal action (where ""it"" contextually refers to suicide based on the phrase ""end me"").
- **Indirect death references**: None beyond the explicit references; ""end me"" is direct.
- **Emotional markers**: Strong hopelessness (""nobody fucking cares,"" ""Nobody cares ever"") and worthlessness (""Im such a spoiled piece of shit"").
- **Specific methods**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, firearms).
- **Preparations**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or scouting locations.
- **Past actions**: No description of past suicide attempts (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").

### Step 2: INTENT ANALYSIS (CRITICAL)
- **Active endorsement**: The writer claims ownership of suicidal intent with ""im going to do it"" and ""pls fucking end me,"" which are direct expressions of desire for death. No distancing language.
- **Passive experience**: No indication of intrusive thoughts (e.g., no ""my brain tells me"" framing).
- **Rejection noted**: No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it""). The plea ""pls fucking end me"" reinforces active desire without rejection.

### Step 3: TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK
- **Past focus**: No references to past actions (e.g., no ""last week I tried"").
- **Present intent**: The phrase ""before the day"" implies immediacy (i.e., today or within hours), especially when combined with the urgent tone.
- **Future ideation**: ""im going to do it"" is future-oriented but anchored by the immediate timeline (""before the day""), making it non-hypothetical.

### Step 4: CATEGORY DECISION TREE
- **a) Past attempt described?** No → Not ATTEMPT.
- **b) Explicit suicide intent + (specific method/preparation OR immediate timeline)?**  
  - Explicit intent: Yes (""end me,"" ""do it"").  
  - Specific method/preparation: No.  
  - Immediate timeline: Yes (""before the day"" indicates imminent action, similar to ""tonight"").  
  - → **BEHAVIOR** (due to intent + immediacy, per rule: ""Immediacy trumps"" and ""Expressions of immediate intent qualify even without method details"").
- **c) Explicit suicide desire without plan/immediacy?** Not applicable, as immediacy is present.
- **d) ONLY distress/metaphors/rejected thoughts?** Not applicable, due to explicit intent and immediacy.

### Final Considerations
- **Irreducible Rules**:  
  - Writer-focused: All content is self-referential.  
  - Temporal hierarchy: No past attempt, so BEHAVIOR takes precedence.  
  - Immediacy trumps: ""before the day"" establishes urgency, overriding non-specific ideation.  
  - Rejection downgrade: No rejection present.  
  - Output exactly one category: BEHAVIOR is the highest applicable.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""suicide"" (mentioned in hypothetical context).  
   - Indirect death references: ""hope it'll be me next"" (referencing stabbings), ""be gone"" (implied).  
   - Emotional markers: Shame avoidance (""wouldn't have to bring shame""), hopelessness (treating death as inevitable relief).  
   - Methods/preparations: None. Death wish is passive (""hope it'll be me"" as victim of crime, not self-inflicted).  
   - Past actions: None.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Active endorsement**: Desire for death (""hope it'll be me next"") but framed as passive victimhood (external stabbing, not suicide).  
   - **Rejection noted**: Explicitly contrasts with suicide (""wouldn’t have to bring shame with a suicide"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Non-specific future (""next"" implies hypothetical/opportunistic timing).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - No explicit *suicidal* intent (wishes for homicide, not self-harm) + no method/preparation → Not BEHAVIOR.  
   - Death wish exists but rejects suicide mechanism → Falls under INDICATOR per rules (distress + metaphorical death wish + explicit rejection of suicide).  

**Key Judgment**:  
- Core expression is shame-driven hopelessness and passive death wish (""hope it'll be me next""), explicitly avoiding suicidal action.  
- ""I hope it’ll be me next"" is a distress metaphor (similar to ""want to disappear""), downgraded by rejection of suicide.  
- Follows Irreducible Rule 4: Rejection (""wouldn’t have to bring shame with a suicide"") → downgrades to INDICATOR.

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""killmyself"", ""put an end to it all"", ""kill myself"".  
   - Indirect death references: ""how can I just disappear?"".  
   - Emotional markers: Hopelessness (""0 friends, never had a girlfriend, 0 social life, no skills/job/money""), worthlessness (""my life is more worth than that"" sarcasm).  
   - Specific methods: None explicitly detailed (e.g., pills, firearms), but ""kill myself"" implies intent.  
   - Preparations: Planning to ""go to another country,"" ""have another identity,"" and stage death as an accident.  
   - Past actions: None described (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""attempted"").  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Active endorsement: Writer claims ownership (""I want to put an end to it all,"" ""kill myself with peace"").  
   - Rejection noted? No explicit disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it""). Mentions being blocked by family but seeks solutions to overcome this barrier.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Future-focused: Plans to disappear (""go to another country"") before suicide, with non-specific timing (""maybe an accident""). No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - a) No past attempt → Not ATTEMPT.  
   - b) Explicit suicide intent (""kill myself"") + Preparation (detailed plans to relocate/stage accident) → **BEHAVIOR**.  
   - c) Ideation would require no preparation (does not apply).  
   - d) Distress alone? No, due to actionable planning.  

**Irreducible Rules Check**:  
- Writer-focused: All references are to self.  
- Temporal hierarchy: Preparation overrides non-immediacy.  
- Rejection: Absent; writer problem-solves barriers.

498,"I'm still here, but I had enough of this. Hey there. Unfortunately, I'm still alive. I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets, but EVERYTIME I ALMOST KILL MYSELF, I FUCKING BREATHE. WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY! WHY!. I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**  
   - Explicit suicide references: ""tried to kill myself"", ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED"", ""gonna try again tonight"", ""Plan B"", ""least pain-proof way I could die"".  
   - Specific method: ""suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag"".  
   - Preparation: Explicit reference to a backup plan (""Plan B"").  
   - Past actions: ""I tried to kill myself last night"".

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**  
   - Active endorsement: ""I FUCKING WANTED TO [die]"", ""THIS NEEDS TO END"", ""gonna try again tonight"".  
   - No rejection: All statements affirm intent; no disavowal (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**  
   - Past: ""tried to kill myself last night"".  
   - Present/Future: ""gonna try again tonight"" (imminent), ""Plan B"" (future backup).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**  
   - Start → **a) Past suicide attempt described?**  
     - YES: ""tried to kill myself last night"" → **ATTEMPT** (irreducible rule: ""tried to"" always → attempt).  
   - Outcome: **Attempt** overrules concurrent behavior/ideation (temporal hierarchy rule).

1. **CONTENT DECONSTRUCTION**:  
   - No explicit suicide references (e.g., ""kill myself"", ""end my life"").  
   - No indirect death references (e.g., ""not wake up"", ""be gone"").  
   - Emotional markers: ""feel empty"", ""worried about ruining my friendships"", ""depressive episode"", exhaustion (""soooo tired"").  
   - No methods, preparations, or past actions described.  

2. **INTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - No active endorsement of suicidal thoughts.  
   - No passive experience of intrusive suicidal ideation.  
   - Distress is present but focused on fatigue and relational anxiety, not death.  

3. **TEMPORAL FRAMEWORK**:  
   - Entirely present-focused (current feelings of emptiness, fatigue, worry).  

4. **CATEGORY DECISION TREE**:  
   - No past attempt → not **Attempt**.  
   - No explicit suicide intent → not **Behavior** or **Ideation**.  
   - Distress/metaphors only (""want to sleep 24/7"" = escapism, not death wish) → **Indicator**.  
   - *Key clarification*: ""Worried about ruining friendships"" and exhaustion align with general distress, not actionable suicide risk.
