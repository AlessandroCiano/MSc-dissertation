0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses hopelessness (""Never will find love,"" ""everything in my life is crap""), self-loathing (""I hate being gay and I hate being myself""), and work-related distress. Crucially, it explicitly mentions ""thinking about ending my life again"" and specifies a method/location: ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off.""  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Ending my life"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The phrase ""go to a bridge and jump off"" identifies a specific method (jumping) and location (bridge), indicating planning.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: ""Again"" suggests past ideation, but the focus is on current/future intent (""I want to go...""). No description of a past *attempt*.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit suicidal thought + specific plan (bridge/jumping) fits ""behavior."" While ""again"" hints at past ideation, the post emphasizes current intent and planning, not a described past attempt.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""inconsolable"" (emotional distress/hopelessness) and ""going to die soon"" (vague reference to death).
   - No explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""  
   - No methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts described.  
   - Temporal context is future-oriented but ambiguous (could imply illness, metaphor, or fatalism).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **not explicitly mentioned**.  
   - No direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - Ambiguous phrasing leans toward 'indicator' per rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Absent. No tools, locations, or preparations indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to future (""going to die soon""), but not tied to a suicide plan or past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses despair and a vague sense of impending death but lacks explicit suicidal intent, plan, or behavior.  
   - Falls under 'indicator' due to absence of explicit suicide mention (despite strong hopelessness).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses strong dissatisfaction with life (""I hate living"") and existential despair questioning the purpose of existence. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and anger, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The phrase ""hate living"" conveys distress but does not explicitly express a desire to end life.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations are referenced.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: All statements are present-tense reflections; no references to past actions or attempts.

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""kill myself"" indicates direct suicidal intent. 
   - Specific request for ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" (a lethal substance) shows planning/preparation. 
   - No references to past attempts or purely emotional distress without suicide context.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: ""Help me kill myself"" is an explicit, direct expression of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: ""barbiturates/Nembutal"" is a specific suicide method, and seeking ""trustworthy"" sources indicates active preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current/future intentions (requesting means now), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicide mention + specific method (barbiturates) + active preparation (seeking access) fits **Behavior**.  
   - Rules note: ""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (means/methods), consider it 'behavior'.""

I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I'm struggling,"" ""I feel worthless,"" ""I'm tired""), self-criticism (""selfish,"" ""lazy""), and isolation. Key elements include:
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""Is there a painless way to die.""
   - Uncertainty about methods: ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.""
   - No specific plans, preparations, tools, locations, or timelines mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm behaviors.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**. The phrases ""painless way to die,"" ""sleep forever,"" and ""die with certainty"" explicitly express a desire to end life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**. While methods are vaguely referenced (""painless way,"" ""die without pain""), no concrete tools, substances, locations, or preparations are specified. The writer explicitly states uncertainty about methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Focuses on **current** feelings and desires. No mention of past attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (ruling out *indicator*).
   - Absence of specific plans/preparations (ruling out *behavior*).
   - No description of past suicide actions (ruling out *attempt*).
   - Fits **ideation**: Explicit expressions of wanting to die, but no actionable plan or method details.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes multiple references to death and dying (e.g., ""none of it will matter when you're dead,"" ""after you die,"" ""after we're dead""). It expresses strong emotional hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""whats the point of living,"" ""life is all pointless,"" ""nothing matters,"" ""huge waste of time""). The user explicitly mentions wanting to kill themselves (""all the things that made me want to kill myself,"" ""i still want to die,"" ""why shouldnt we just kill ourselves""). There are no specific suicide methods, plans, or preparations described (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions). References to past events include past suicidal thoughts (""for a year straight i was constantly thinking about how nothing matters"") but no description of actual suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""kill ourselves."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""i still want to die.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The user discusses suicidal thoughts but does not outline a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past suicidal thoughts (""for a year straight i was constantly thinking"") but focuses on current feelings (""i still want to die,"" ""i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways""). There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mentions of suicide and wanting to die rule out ""indicator."" The absence of a specific plan or method means it does not qualify as ""behavior."" With no description of past suicide attempts, it is not ""attempt."" The content aligns with ""ideation"" because it expresses a current desire to die without a concrete plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains expressions of intense emotional distress (""so much mental pain"", ""I can't handle it"", ""I hate everything"", ""I need peace"").
   - There are explicit statements about not wanting to survive (""I don't wanna survive it"") and a desire for cessation (""I want it to stop"").
   - Phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight"" and ""I want it to be over tonight"" indicate a wish to end existence.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, preparations, or past attempts are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly named (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").
   - However, direct expressions of wanting to cease existing are present (""I don't wanna survive it,"" ""I want to be gone""). This exceeds vague distress and explicitly conveys a desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, notes) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Describes current/future intentions (""tonight""), not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to not survive (""I don't wanna survive it"") and urgency (""tonight"") align with **Ideation** (explicit wish to end life without a stated plan or method).  
   - Falls short of **Behavior** due to lack of planning details.  
   - Not **Attempt** (no past actions) or **Indicator** (explicit desire to die elevates it beyond general distress).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness, and lack of purpose.  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I just wanna die"" and ""It's the best for me"" directly indicate a desire to end life.

   - Explicit suicidal desire (""wanna die"") is present, but no plan, method, or behavior is indicated. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without specifics).  
   - Does not qualify as *Behavior* (no plan/method) or *Attempt* (no past action).  
   - Not *Indicator* due to explicit mention of death.

It's so tiring to try to love yourself when your own mind is against you. I know really know what this is a symptom of. I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly. It describes intrusive suicidal thoughts (""my brain keeps telling me to kill myself"") alongside feelings of worthlessness (""ugly and stupid""), exhaustion, and loneliness. The user explicitly states they ""don't actually want to"" act on these thoughts. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts are referenced.
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal desire, even if the user denies current intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No. No methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The thoughts are presented as involuntary and unwanted.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to ongoing intrusive thoughts (""keeps telling me"") with no indication of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") meets the threshold for **ideation**. The denial of intent and absence of plans/preparations excludes ""behavior."" Lack of past attempts excludes ""attempt."" General distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but explicit suicidal ideation overrules this.

I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird.

But these things dont exist, so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids. i dont know, i wouldnt know, im damaged",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains multiple key elements:
   - Explicit expressions of suicidal intent: ""kill myself,"" ""want to die now,"" and ""erase all traces of my existence.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""stuck, stagnant,"" ""falling down this void""), worthlessness (""everyone is going to be better without me""), and isolation (""no space for me"").
   - Specific methods mentioned: ""run towards a cop with a knife"" and ""find a dealer with some opioids.""
   - No references to past attempts; all statements reflect current intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""want to die now,"" confirming explicit suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The user specifies two concrete methods (knife confrontation with police, obtaining opioids), indicating active consideration of means.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to current/future intentions (""want to die now,"" ""i would go for it""). Mentions a 5–6 year struggle but no past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (qualifying for 'ideation').
   - Specific methods are named (knife, opioids), which constitutes planning under the 'behavior' definition.
   - No past attempts described; focus is on imminent action.
   - Rules prioritize 'behavior' over 'ideation' when plans are explicit, even if phrased conditionally (""either i run... or find..."").

I'm deteriorating. I just want to get it over with. I'm not alone, but I can't tell anyone either. I refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will. The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I just want to get it over with"" and ""if I go through with it,"" which imply a desire to end suffering but do not explicitly state suicide, death, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm deteriorating""), despair (""It's not working anymore""), and fear of vulnerability. There are no specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts. The fear of pain related to ""it"" suggests consideration of suicide but lacks explicit details.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""kill myself""). The expressions are indirect and vague, so based on the rule to lean toward 'indicator' when unclear, this points away from 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations are described. The fear of pain is general and not tied to a plan, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and future considerations (e.g., ""if I go through with it""), with no references to past suicide attempts. The mention of a mental hospital relates to past events but not suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of distress and hopelessness but no explicit suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt. Phrases like ""get it over with"" are vague and do not meet the threshold for explicit ideation. Per the rules, when in doubt about explicit mention, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. Thus, the best fit is 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of abandonment, self-doubt (""maybe it's me?""), and emotional pain (""it still hurts""). Key phrases include ""I'd leave myself if I could"" and ""it starts to hurt less,"" indicating hopelessness and detachment. No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. ""I'd leave myself"" is metaphorical and vague (not a direct expression of suicidal intent).
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Absent. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations discussed.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on recurring emotional patterns, not past attempts or future plans.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention: ""kill myself"" directly expresses suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").
   - Specific preparations: Notes are ready (""i already got my suicidal notes ready"").
   - Method/timing consideration: ""just a matter of when and how"" implies active planning.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""kill myself"" is an unambiguous declaration.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Preparations confirmed: Suicide notes are prepared (tangible step).
   - ""When and how"" indicates active deliberation of method/timing, though methods aren't specified.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to future intent (""going to kill myself""), not past attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal intent + preparation (notes) meets ""behavior"" criteria. No specific method is detailed, but notes constitute concrete preparation. Falls under ""behavior"" per definition: ""exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"".

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing, body dysmorphia, and a desire to escape one's identity (""wish I could press a button and be someone else""). 
   - Mentions actions taken to change appearance (dyed hair, makeup, clothes, diet changes) but all focus on dissatisfaction rather than self-harm.
   - No references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No expressions of hopelessness about life itself—only about physical appearance/identity.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, wanting to die, or not be alive. The desire is to ""be someone else,"" not to cease existing.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No methods, tools, locations, or preparations** related to suicide/self-harm are mentioned. Actions described (e.g., diet, haircuts) are cosmetic/behavioral adjustments.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on **current emotional state** and past efforts to alter appearance. No reference to past or future suicidal actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Falls under **indicator**: Extreme distress and self-criticism are present, but **no explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior** is expressed. The core wish is identity alteration, not self-annihilation. Rules emphasize that general dissatisfaction/hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions defaults to ""indicator.""

In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses others who post about suicide, questioning their motivations. The author states their opinion that such posters are ""looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves."" No personal expressions of distress, death wishes, plans, or self-harm are present. The focus is entirely on interpreting others' behavior.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: The author references suicide in the context of others' posts (""going to kill themselves""), but expresses no personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts. **No** explicit self-referential suicide mentions.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No methods, plans, or preparations related to the author are mentioned.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: No references to past or current personal experiences with suicide.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post lacks any personal expression of suicidal ideation, behavior, or past attempts. It contains general commentary about suicide but no explicit self-referential indicators beyond broad discussion. Fits the **indicator** definition (general distress/discussion without explicit personal suicidal intent).

I just want someone to love me and accept me and its never going to happen. I want to be brave enough to kill myself but the past two times ive tried ive failed. Im so tired and sad.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself,"" and explicit references to past suicide attempts (""the past two times ive tried ive failed""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""it's never going to happen""), despair (""Im so tired of being alive""), and worthlessness. There are no specific methods, plans, or preparations described for current suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or timing). The focus is on past actions and current feelings of wanting to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""no point in being alive anymore,"" ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans for current suicide are mentioned. The desire to die is present, but there is no description of how, when, or where the user might act on it now. Preparations are not indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current suicidal ideation (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") and explicitly describes past suicide attempts (""the past two times ive tried ive failed"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The description of past suicide attempts (""ive tried"") fits the 'Attempt' category, which is defined as content focused on historic actions. Although current suicidal ideation is present, there is no mention of a current plan or method, so it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. The rule under 'Attempt' states: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, current plans are not mentioned—only current ideation and past actions—but the explicit reference to past attempts alone qualifies for 'Attempt'. If the post only had current ideation without past attempts, it would be 'Ideation', but the historical context takes precedence.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit phrases: ""killing myself"" and ""I don't want to be alive."" These directly reference suicide and express a desire to end life. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The tone indicates hopelessness but no references to past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Killing myself"" explicitly states suicide, and ""I don't want to be alive"" expresses a direct desire to die.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, or preparations are described (e.g., no mention of weapons, substances, notes, or locations). 
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The language reflects current/future intentions (""I don't want to be alive""), with no indication of past attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: Explicit suicidal intent is present without a specific plan or preparation. This aligns with **Ideation** (explicit desire to die without a defined method or behavioral indicators).

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""desire to kill myself,"" ""Killing myself,"" ""getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""what reason is there to live""), worthlessness (""it's meant literally nothing""), and despair (""I don't care anymore"").  
   - Specific plans: The train metaphor is hypothetical, not a concrete plan or preparation.  
   - Past attempts: Explicitly states, ""I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""Killing myself"" leave no ambiguity.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan**: The train reference is metaphorical (""if that means getting hit by..."") and lacks actionable details (e.g., location, timing, or preparations). Overdoses are referenced as past actions, not current plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past attempts**: Clearly describes multiple overdoses (within past weeks/months).  
   - **Current intent**: Expresses ongoing suicidal ideation (""desire to kill myself has not"") but no active planning.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly references **past suicide attempts** (overdoses), which aligns with the **Attempt** category (""describes past attempts at suicide"").  
   - Current expressions of suicidal desire (""desire to kill myself"") and hopelessness support ideation, but the **rules prioritize ""Attempt"" when past attempts are mentioned**, even with concurrent ideation.  
   - No actionable plan (e.g., acquiring means for a new method) rules out ""Behavior.""

Then I think about how many fucking issues I already have and its just too much. I'm going insane what the fuck do I do? My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them. Please I'm so fucking scared.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses extreme distress, panic attacks, fear about potential health issues (diabetes), anxiety about DIY HRT, and feeling overwhelmed by existing problems. Key phrases include ""I can't live without estrogen"" and ""it's just too much."" However, there is **no mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or explicit desire to end life**. Emotional indicators (fear, hopelessness) are present but lack suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit statements about suicide, wanting to die, or not being alive (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I wish I were dead""). Phrases like ""I can't live"" refer metaphorically to dependency on estrogen, not literal suicide.  
   → **No**

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No references to suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or self-harm actions.  
   → **Not applicable**

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current distress and fears; **no mention of past suicide attempts or plans**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Distress and hopelessness are evident, but **suicidal thoughts/plans are absent**.  
   - ""I can't live without estrogen"" is contextualized as emotional desperation, not a suicidal statement.  
   - Follows the rule: ""When in doubt whether suicide was explicitly mentioned, choose 'indicator'.""

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""There is NO hope left""), lists multiple failed treatments (medication, biofeedback, therapy, EMDR, TMS), mentions financial hardship and food insecurity, and includes repetitive statements about trying (""I tried. And I tried again...""). It ends with an explicit statement about ending life: ""Now it's time to end it.""
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""end it"" is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair and hopelessness are evident throughout.
   - Specific plans or methods: No details on methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are provided.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""I tried"" is repeated, but it is ambiguous and likely refers to attempting treatments (as contextually tied to the prior list) rather than explicit suicide attempts. No concrete descriptions of past suicide actions (e.g., overdose) are given.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""end it,"" which is a clear expression of wanting to die. Therefore, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, locations) or preparations are mentioned. ""End it"" is vague and lacks planning details. With no explicit plan, this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current hopelessness and future intent (""Now it's time to end it""). The ""tried"" statements are ambiguous but appear to refer to past treatment efforts, not suicide attempts. No past suicide attempts are explicitly described, so 'attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""end it"") without any specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' definition. The ambiguity around ""tried"" does not meet the threshold for 'attempt' (which requires concrete past actions), and the lack of planning rules out 'behavior'. Emotional distress alone would have been 'indicator', but the explicit suicidal expression elevates it to 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""nothing fills the hole in my heart""), loneliness, disconnection (""I feel like I am on the moon""), and self-blame (""something is wrong with me"").
   - Plans/methods: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - Past attempts: References past coping (""tried to hide this"") but no mention of prior suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""thinking about suicide"").  
   - Direct desire expressed (""everyday I am trying to survive"" implies struggle against suicidal urges).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present without plans or methods.  
   - Emotional distress supports ideation but doesn't escalate to behavior without concrete plans.

I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death: ""I'm not scared to die"" indicates an acceptance of death, but not an explicit desire to die by suicide. However, the phrase ""I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family"" implies suicidal thoughts, as it suggests the user is staying alive for others' sake but has given up on life. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are strong: ""What's the use,"" ""I've given up in life,"" and ""for me it doesn't [get better]"" show deep despair. Specific plans and preparations are explicitly stated: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April"" – this includes a suicide note (preparation) and a set timeline. No references to past suicide attempts are mentioned; the user describes life events (e.g., dropping out of college) but no self-harm actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I'm not scared to die"" combined with the context of a plan leans toward explicit suicidal intent. Since the word ""suicide"" isn't used, but the desire to not be alive is implied (e.g., staying alive only for family), this could be ambiguous. However, the presence of a plan pushes it beyond vague feelings. Rule: If unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation', but here the plan makes it more explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are not detailed, but preparations are clear: ""note"" (suicide note) and ""date"" (specific timeline in early April) indicate explicit planning. The ""plan"" is mentioned, even if methods aren't specified. This fits the behavior category, which includes ""mentions of a plan"" or ""preparations taken"" like a suicide note. Rule: If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here the note and date are unambiguous preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""will be in early April""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., deciding to keep living only for family, not being scared to die) and explicit planning (note and date). This aligns with the behavior category, defined as including expressions of suicidal thoughts and mentions of a plan or preparations. It is not indicator (due to explicit suicidal context), not solely ideation (because of the plan), and not attempt (no past actions described).

So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""I'm going to kill myself"", ""actually do go through with it and kill myself"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one would care or miss me""), despair (""end up dead in a gutter""), anger, and self-harm references (""cuts I have all over myself"").  
   - Plans/preparations: Mentions going to the ER to seek psychiatric help but explicitly states debating between seeking help *or* killing oneself. No specific suicide method (tools, location, timing) described.  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""go through with it and kill myself"".  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: While suicide is explicitly threatened, no actionable plan (e.g., ""I will jump from X bridge,"" ""I bought a rope"") is stated. The alternative (seeking hospitalization) is discussed, but suicide is framed as an abstract choice.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal,"" indicating direct references to suicide. Emotional indicators include ""so tired,"" ""not special to anything or anyone,"" and feelings of hopelessness and isolation (e.g., others not helping despite knowing). A specific method is mentioned (""a good clif"" as a location for suicide), but the user states they ""can't commit to it,"" showing hesitation and no active preparation. There are no references to past attempts or self-harm behaviors; the focus is on current thoughts and feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"" and ""suicidal""), so this is not an indicator. Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""i can't kill myself"" implies the desire but inability to act).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (cliff as a location) is identified, but there is no description of a concrete plan, timeline, or preparations (e.g., no mention of going to the cliff or acquiring means). The user emphasizes they ""can't commit to it,"" indicating contemplation without action. Since the planning is not explicit, and there is uncertainty, this leans toward ideation over behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current suicidal thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""Im so tired,"" current inability to commit). References to telling someone about being suicidal relate to disclosure but not past actions. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of suicide and desire to die rules out ""indicator."" The mention of a method (cliff) could suggest behavior, but the lack of explicit planning or preparation (e.g., no steps taken, only hesitation) and the rule to choose ""ideation"" if uncertain about planning align this with ""ideation."" No past attempt is described, so ""attempt"" does not apply. The core is explicit suicidal thoughts without a clear plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life. Key elements include:

29,"I'm ready. I'm finally ready to just end it all, I'm gonna wait a few weeks but I already know how I'm gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell anyone either, all ready tried that before and no one really understands. So goodbye everybody, I doubt anyone will care.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end it all,"" which implies suicide, and ""goodbye everybody"" suggests a final departure. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care""). There is a reference to a plan: ""I already know how I'm gonna do it,"" but no specific method (e.g., tools, locations) is detailed. Preparations are indicated by ""I'm gonna wait a few weeks,"" showing intent but not concrete actions like acquiring means. The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" refers to past attempts to seek help (""tell anyone""), not a past suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly implied through phrases like ""end it all,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide, and the overall context of saying goodbye. Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""ready to just end it all""). This is not vague; it clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method is alluded to (""I already know how I'm gonna do it""), but it is not specified (e.g., no mention of tools, substances, or locations). There are signs of intent and timing (""wait a few weeks,"" ""not gonna tell anyone""), but no explicit details about preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note). Since the method is not explicit, and there is uncertainty, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""gonna wait a few weeks,"" ""gonna do it""). The reference to the past (""tried that before"") describes seeking help, not a suicide attempt. Therefore, it does not describe a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal ideation (desire to die) but lacks a specific, detailed plan or method. This fits the 'ideation' category, which includes explicit desires to end one's life without concrete plans. The mention of knowing ""how"" is insufficient for 'behavior' since no explicit method is stated. The past reference to seeking help does not qualify as an 'attempt,' and the emotional distress alone does not make it 'indicator' due to the explicit suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""I can't even fucking kill my self"" and ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I'm a burden,"" ""disappointment,"" ""existence screws up everyone's lives"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: References holding a blade (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it""), indicating a method (cutting) and physical preparation.  
   - Past attempts: None mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill my self,"" ""if I did it"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes (""blade"" as a specific tool for suicide, and physical interaction with it).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current intentions/struggles (e.g., holding the blade now).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire + specific method (blade) + preparation (holding it) aligns with **Behavior**.  
   - Falls short of **Attempt** (no description of past action).  
   - Exceeds **Ideation** due to method/preparation details.  
   - Rules: ""Mentions tools suitable to end life"" → **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life"") and expresses absolute certainty about future suicide (""100% confirmed""). It references a timeline (""not live to see my 40th birthday in 2023"") and extreme hopelessness (""no hope,"" ""pointless, meaningless""). No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. The phrase ""I DID try"" suggests past struggles but does not explicitly describe a past suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""I will be taking my own life"").  
   → **Yes**  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned.  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are indicated.  
   - A general timeline is given (before 2023), but it lacks concrete planning details.  
   → **No explicit plan**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intentions (""will happen,"" ""I will not live"").  
   - ""I DID try"" implies past efforts but does not describe a suicide attempt (e.g., no action like overdose).  
   → **Current/future intentions**  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent qualifies it beyond *indicator*.  
   - Absence of methods/preparations rules out *behavior*.  
   - No description of past suicide actions rules out *attempt*.  
   - The certainty of future suicide and explicit desire to die align with **ideation** (strong desire without concrete plan).  
   - The deadline (""before 2023"") is a temporal intention, not a plan with method (per rules: ""if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress (""I'm so tired,"" ""tired of being criticized and unloved"") and explicitly mentions suicide multiple times with phrases like ""kill myself."" It references a past opportunity to commit suicide (""I had the perfect opportunity to kill myself 6 month ago"") but clarifies no action was taken (""I was a pussy,"" ""I shouldn't have talked myself down""). Current suicidal thoughts are present (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). There are no specific methods, plans, preparations, or descriptions of self-harming behavior mentioned. Regret over not acting on the past opportunity is evident, but no actual past attempt occurred.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned for any current or future actions.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - The reference to a past ""opportunity"" is vague and lacks detail, so it does not constitute a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to a past situation involving suicidal thoughts (""6 month ago""), but it was not an attempt since no action was taken (they ""talked myself down""). The primary focus is on current, ongoing suicidal ideation (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself""). There is no description of a concrete past suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mentions of suicide and desire to die rule out ""indicator.""
   - The absence of specific plans, methods, or preparations rules out ""behavior.""
   - The lack of a described concrete past suicide attempt (only thoughts/opportunity) rules out ""attempt.""

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress, feelings of weakness, embarrassment, and hopelessness (""I'm pathetic,"" ""all I'm doing is embarrassing myself,"" ""I know it's never gonna happen"").  
   - There are **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm**. The focus is on interpersonal conflict, loneliness, and perceived personal failure.

I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me?

God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad.

I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: ""I feel hollow,"" ""sadness that I have to live another day,"" ""I hate myself,"" and hopelessness about relationships and self-worth.
   - Expresses a desire to escape reality: ""wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land"" and ""I just want to not exist.""
   - No references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. The phrase ""(metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself"" explicitly frames self-destruction as non-literal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is **not explicitly mentioned**. While ""I just want to not exist"" implies despair, it lacks direct phrasing like ""kill myself"" (outside the metaphorical context) or ""end my life."" The metaphorical reference is disclaimed as non-literal.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No methods (tools, substances), locations, or preparations described. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current emotional suffering, not past actions or future plans. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes explicit phrases like ""I just want to end it,"" ""put a bullet right through it,"" ""take my own life,"" ""I just want to die,"" and ""I hate being alive"" (repeatedly). These indicate direct references to suicide and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, and distress are present, such as ""I'm losing my mind,"" ""I'm having a complete breakdown,"" ""I hate myself,"" ""I hate my brain,"" ""I cant take it anymore,"" ""tired of being alone,"" ""tired of feeling worthless,"" and ""tired of failing everything.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""put a bullet right through it"" mentions a specific method (using a gun). However, this is framed as a desire (""I want to"") rather than an active plan. There is no indication of preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note, or setting a time). The statement ""I don't have the balls to take my own life"" further suggests no imminent action or capability to act.
   - References to past attempts: There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts; all content relates to current feelings and desires.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes, through phrases like ""take my own life"" and ""end it.""
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes, with repeated statements like ""I just want to die"" and ""I hate being alive.""
   - Conclusion: Explicit mentions are clear, so this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned (""put a bullet right through it""), but it is expressed as a wish (""I want to"") and not as a concrete plan. The context shows no signs of preparation or intent to act, reinforced by ""I don't have the balls to take my own life.""
   - Uncertainty: While a method is specified, the lack of explicit planning or behavioral indicators creates doubt about classifying it as 'behavior'. Per rules, if uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I'm having,"" ""I want,"" ""I cant take it anymore""). There is no reference to past attempts or events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die, references to suicide methods) but without evidence of a specific plan, preparation, or action. The mention of a method (""bullet"") is part of the ideation (a thought about how) rather than behavioral planning. Rules emphasize choosing 'ideation' when uncertain about explicit planning. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition: explicit desires to end life without a specific plan. It does not fit 'attempt' (no past actions), 'behavior' (no clear plan), or 'indicator' (suicide is explicitly mentioned).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - Emotional indicators: ""wasn't made for life"", ""can't keep doing this"", ""too painful"", ""loathe myself"", ""better if I was dead"".
   - Specific plan/method: ""take a bunch of pills while everyone's asleep"" (method: overdose; preparation: timing when others are asleep).
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""suicide watch"", ""end it"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method mentioned (""pills"") and implicit preparation (timing). Hesitation due to fear/pain doesn't negate the explicit plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Describes current/future intentions (""could take""), not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**. ""Indicator"" is ruled out by explicit suicide references. ""Ideation"" is insufficient due to the concrete plan. ""Attempt"" doesn't apply as no past action is described.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and repetitive expressions of despair (""fuck me,"" ""I'm useless,"" ""everyone would be better off with me dead""). Key elements include:
   - Direct mention of suicide (""kill myself"").
   - Strong emotional indicators (hopelessness, self-loathing).
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""I want to kill myself"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die (""everyone would be better off with me dead"").  
   → **Yes**.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (tools, locations, substances) described.  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   → **No plan indicated**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current intentions/feelings (""I want,"" ""I can't breathe"").  
   - No references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die meets the threshold for **ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out **behavior**.  
   - Current focus (not past actions) rules out **attempt**.  
   - Explicit suicide mention disqualifies **indicator**.

42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes ""i thought about slitting my wrists today,"" which is a specific method of self-harm that can lead to death, indicating suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Phrases like ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" and ""feeling more alone"" convey hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Slitting my wrists"" is a specific method mentioned, but it is framed as a thought (""thought about"") and explicitly not acted upon (""but i didnt do it""). No preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.
   - References to past attempts: No past attempts are mentioned; the post only discusses a thought from the same day without action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""slitting my wrists"" is an explicit expression of a suicidal method, which implies a desire to not be alive. Since the desire is not directly stated (e.g., ""I want to die""), but the method is explicit, this leans toward 'ideation' based on the category definitions.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, but it is part of a thought, not a current plan or preparation. The user emphasizes no action was taken (""but i didnt do it""). Therefore, this does not constitute explicit planning for 'behavior' classification.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The thought (""thought about slitting my wrists today"") refers to a recent event (today) but is described in the past tense and not acted upon. It does not describe a past attempt or future intention beyond the expressed thought.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts (ideation) through the mention of a specific method (""slitting my wrists""), without evidence of planning, preparation, or action. This aligns with the 'ideation' category (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It does not meet 'behavior' (no plan or preparation), 'attempt' (no description of past actions), or 'indicator' (suicidal thoughts are explicit, not vague).
   - Rules applied: Suicide risk is for the author; no uncertainty about explicit suicidal thoughts exists here, so 'ideation' is chosen over 'indicator'.

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" explicitly.
   - Describes emotional distress (shame, regret) and physical pain, but no references to specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts.
   - Focuses on current emotional state triggered by dental issues.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: ""Suicidal feelings"" is an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods (tools, locations), preparations, or timelines. Only general feelings.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current feelings (""coming back""), not past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present, but no plan, behavior, or reference to past attempts. Falls under **Ideation** per definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts [...] without any specific plan.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""i'm someone who wants to die,"" directly expressing a desire to not be alive.  
   - There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or references to past attempts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (implied by inability to follow subreddit rules due to suicidal feelings).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes,"" ""goodbye letters,"" and states ""I'm leaving soon"" with ""my minds made up."" This indicates active preparation for suicide (writing notes) and a current intent to die. No specific method (e.g., tools/locations) is mentioned, but the focus on suicide notes constitutes preparation.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Suicide notes"" is a direct reference to suicide.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Preparation is explicitly stated (writing suicide/goodbye notes), which aligns with the ""behavior"" category (preparations like notes are explicitly included).  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to imminent action (""leaving soon""), not past attempts.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: Explicit suicidal intent + active preparation (notes) qualifies as ""behavior."" No specific method is needed since preparations (e.g., notes) suffice. Not ""attempt"" (no past action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide date"", ""end thing v v soon"", ""I like lavender"" (interpreted as farewell request).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I wasn't trying hard enough""), distrust (""TRuST NOT 1 SINGLE soul""), trauma, despair (""I'm fucking done"").  
   - Specific plan: ""This Friday, May 14, 2021 is my suicide date"".  
   - Past attempts: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"".  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. ""Suicide date"" and ""end thing"" are explicit.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific date provided (May 14, 2021), but no explicit method (e.g., tools/location).  
   - Preparation inferred (""save some flowers"") but not concrete.

   - **Rule clarification**: When past attempts and current plans coexist, classify as **'attempt'**.

It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""Pointlessness,"" ""I want to disappear forever,"" ""I know I will die by 35"") and despair about existence. It explicitly states a desire to cease existing (""disappear forever"") and self-predicts death by age 35. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include distress about immortality (""heaven distresses me"") and resignation to suffering (""They'll suffer and that will be that"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself"").  
   - However, direct expressions of wanting to cease existing appear: ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" (implying self-determined early death). These qualify as explicit desires not to be alive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (tools, substances), locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to dying by 35 is temporal but lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""I want to disappear,"" ""I will die by 35""). No references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to ""disappear forever"" and expectation of death by 35 constitute suicidal ideation (explicit wish not to be alive).  
   - Absence of methods/preparation rules out ""behavior."" No past attempts rule out ""attempt."" General despair alone would be ""indicator,"" but explicit statements elevate it to ""ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicide methods (hanging and taking pills) and expresses a desire to die (""I'm trying to die""). It includes emotional indicators like frustration about the difficulty of suicide, but no references to past attempts or explicit preparations (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or writing notes).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (e.g., ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""I'm trying to die"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (e.g., ""I'm trying to die"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes (hanging using shower/door frame, taking pills).
   - Signs of preparation: No. The discussion is speculative and uncertain (e.g., ""idk if,"" ""might""), focusing on feasibility and risks rather than concrete plans or actions. Due to uncertainty, lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions, not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and methods, but the uncertainty and lack of concrete plans or preparations align with 'ideation' (expressions of desire to die without a specific plan). It does not meet 'behavior' criteria as there is no evidence of planning or preparation, and 'attempt' is ruled out due to no past actions. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to explicit suicide mentions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""count my pills"" and ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" – indicates thoughts about pill overdose as a suicide method.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""nobody loves or cares for me"") and self-blame (""why am i such a coward"").  
   - No explicit preparation (e.g., stockpiling pills) or timeline for acting.  
   - No reference to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - However, ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" strongly implies a desire to die via overdose.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Pills are implicitly referenced as a method, but no specifics (type, quantity, plan to acquire/use).  
   - Counting pills suggests preoccupation but not active preparation (e.g., ""I saved 100 pills to use tomorrow"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes recurring thoughts (""every night,"" ""every day"") about current suicidal ideation.  
   - No mention of past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is implied through regretting not taking all pills, aligning with **ideation**.  
   - Lack of concrete plans/preparations rules out **behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes strong, unbearable thoughts, a downward spiral, daily struggles, keeping secrets to avoid psych ward hospitalization, and uncertainty about what to do.
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: None. The thoughts are not specified as suicidal.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""downward spiral,"" ""struggle"") and despair are present, but not linked to suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: The mention of ""psych ward again"" implies past mental health issues, but it does not specify a suicide attempt (e.g., it could relate to depression or other crises).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"").
   - No direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. The distress is general, not suicidal.
   - Unclear? Yes, but leaning toward 'indicator' as per rules (when in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation').

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations described.
   - No evidence of planning, so this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current struggles (""lately,"" ""past few months,"" ""everyday"") and a vague past hospitalization (psych ward). No description of past suicide attempts or current/future suicide plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or references to past attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The phrase ""tried to kms"" (where ""kms"" is slang for ""kill myself"") explicitly refers to suicide and self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses depression (""I am depressed af"") and frustration, indicating distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific method, plan, or preparation for suicide is described; the focus is on a past action.
   - References to past attempts: The statement ""tried to kms yesterday"" directly describes a past suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""kms"" is a clear and direct abbreviation for ""kill myself,"" confirming an explicit expression of suicide. (Yes)
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""tried to kms"" implies an action taken to end life, which is an explicit desire to not be alive. (Yes)

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods mentioned: None. The post does not detail any tools, locations, substances, or methods for suicide.
   - Signs of preparation: None indicated. The reference is to a past event, not current planning or acquisition of means.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, and the focus is on past action, this step leans toward not classifying as behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday"" explicitly describes a suicide attempt that occurred in the past. There is no mention of current or future intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key element is the description of a past suicide attempt (""tried to kms yesterday""), which falls under the ""Attempt"" category definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide."" The mention of depression (""depressed af"") supports distress but does not override the explicit reference to a past attempt.
   - This is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not ""Ideation"" because it describes an action (attempt), not just thoughts. It is not ""Behavior"" because no current plan or preparation is indicated.
   - Following the rules: The suicide risk pertains to the user (the writer), and ""tried to kms"" confirms a concrete past action, not mere thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes ""I cant live anymore,"" which explicitly expresses a desire not to be alive. It also references ""a non painful way to do this,"" where ""this"" likely implies suicide or ending life, but the word ""suicide"" itself is not used.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and despair are evident (e.g., ""I cant fight anymore,"" ""non stop pain and suffering,"" ""I'm still paying for it"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The phrase ""a non painful way to do this"" suggests a consideration of methods, but it is vague and not specific (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances mentioned). There are no signs of preparation.
   - References to past attempts: None present; the post focuses on current suffering and feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no use of words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""). However, ""I cant live anymore"" is a direct expression of not wanting to be alive, which aligns with suicidal ideation. Since the desire to not be alive is explicit, this leans toward ideation rather than indicator.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods are detailed (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or substances). ""A non painful way"" is ambiguous and does not constitute an explicit plan or preparation. Due to uncertainty, the category should default to ideation over behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""I cant live anymore"") and ongoing suffering, not past events. There is no reference to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The key element is the explicit expression of not wanting to live (""I cant live anymore""), which fits the definition of ideation (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). The vague reference to ""a non painful way"" does not rise to the level of behavior, as it lacks specificity. Emotional distress alone would be indicator, but the direct desire to not be alive elevates it to ideation. No past attempts are mentioned, so attempt is not applicable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to kill myself"" and ""do it"" (referencing suicide).
   - It includes emotional hopelessness (""my family is upset,"" ""they are supposed to be remembered"").
   - Specific plans are outlined: timeframe (""next week""), method (""drugs""), and preparation (""write a suicide note"").
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**, specific method (drugs), timeframe (next week), and preparatory action (writing a suicide note) are mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to future intentions (""next week""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicide intent + specific plan/preparation aligns with **Behavior** (per definition: explicit planning like methods/preparations). The suicide note and drug method are clear preparatory acts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""life is so cyclic,"" ""i have no motivation,"" ""it's so lonely""), despair (""i'm tired of being sick,"" ""none of the pills do enough""), and feelings of being overwhelmed (""tired of working 40 hours a week,"" ""where is the motivation""). 
   - There is a vague reference to ending something with ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue,"" but this does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. 
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). 
   - No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm behaviors.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die""). 
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I don't want to live anymore"" is absent). The phrase ""get this over with"" is ambiguous and could refer to ending suffering or a life phase, but it is not explicit about suicide. Since it is unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, pills for overdose) or preparations (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are mentioned. The post focuses on emotional and situational struggles.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and frustrations (e.g., tiredness, lack of motivation, financial stress). The phrase ""get this over with soon"" implies a future-oriented desire for change, but it is not tied to a suicide plan. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, sadness, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. The vague statement ""i'm ready to get this over with soon"" does not clearly indicate a desire to die, and under the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, it should be classified as 'indicator'. Additionally, the rules state that ""very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopelessness"" without explicit suicide mentions is 'indicator', and to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when in doubt. There is no evidence of ideation, behavior, or attempt.

I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I have overdosed"" and details the specific substance (500mg Zoloft) and immediate physical effects (headache). 
   - Emotional indicators include regret, self-punishment (""punish me for being such a nuisance""), and a desire to end suffering (""I just want my suffering to be over"").
   - Specific method (overdose) and dosage (500mg Zoloft) are identified, and the act has already occurred (""I have overdosed"").
   - The phrase ""I finally went through"" implies completed action, and symptoms confirm the overdose is in progress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated (e.g., no terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""). 
   - However, ""I have overdosed"" is an explicit act of self-harm with clear intent to inflict punishment, though the user states ""I don't want to die."" This ambiguity leans toward observable behavior rather than explicit ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method (500mg Zoloft overdose) is mentioned, and the action has been executed (""I took""). 
   - Signs of preparation are implicit in acquiring and ingesting the substance.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The overdose is described as a completed action (""I have overdosed"") with current effects (""I’m getting a headache""). This is a past/ongoing event, not a future plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The overdose constitutes a concrete self-harming action with a specific method, aligning with **Behavior** (current self-harm with explicit planning/method). 
   - However, the post describes this as a completed act (""I finally went through""), and overdosing is a recognized suicide attempt method. The user’s regret and physical symptoms confirm the action occurred, fitting **Attempt** (past/ongoing suicidal action). 
   - Crucially, **Attempt** takes precedence for historical actions even if current distress is present. The core focus is on the completed overdose.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""I'm doing it in the near future"" and ""knowing I'm going to,"" implying a planned action. Phrases like ""ready to go"" and ""I'm ready"" suggest resolution.  
   - Emotional tone: ""at peace,"" indicating calmness/resignation, not explicit despair.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., weapons, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - No direct terms like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""end my life,"" or ""kill myself."" The word ""it"" is ambiguous.  
   - **Verdict**: No explicit mention.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No details about how the action will be carried out (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparatory steps.  
   - **Verdict**: No explicit plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""near future,"" ""going to""). No past actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Ambiguous language (""it,"" ""go"") hints at self-harm but lacks explicit suicidal terminology.  
   - Mentions future intent but no plan/method, ruling out ""behavior.""  
   - No past attempts, ruling out ""attempt.""  
   - Without explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""want to die""), it doesn’t meet ""ideation"" criteria. Falls under ""indicator"" due to vagueness and implied distress.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""i was suicidal"" explicitly, indicating past suicidal thoughts. There are emotional indicators of frustration (""high school counselors suck"") and reflection on a negative past experience. However, there are no references to death, dying, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts beyond the general state of being suicidal. The focus is on a past event from four years ago (""it was 4 yrs ago""), with no indication of current suicidal feelings, plans, or behaviors.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""i was suicidal"" is a direct reference to suicidal thoughts. There are no direct expressions of current desire to die or not be alive; the mention is in the past tense. Since suicide is explicitly stated, this cannot be 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post does not discuss any plans for suicide, past or present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers entirely to past events (""4 yrs ago""). It describes a time when the user was suicidal but does not describe any past suicide attempts (e.g., no mention of actions taken). The phrase ""i was suicidal"" suggests past ideation, not an attempt, as there is no description of concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of past suicidal thoughts (""i was suicidal"") rules out 'indicator', as the post contains an explicit expression of suicide.
   - There is no evidence of a plan, method, or preparation, so 'behavior' does not apply.
   - The post does not describe a past suicide attempt (only suicidal thoughts), so 'attempt' is not appropriate.
   - The content includes an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts in the past, which aligns with 'ideation' (defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, without a specific plan). Although the thoughts are historical, the category definition does not specify they must be current, and the post expresses these thoughts directly. With no current plans or behaviors indicated, 'ideation' is the best fit.

I lock myself away from everyone because of that. My heart still wishes for someone to care for me while I'm sad and maybe try to make me happier. But I know for a fact that **nothing will make me happier. Not even love, being rich, surrounded by loving friends and family, being smart/goodlooking enough for my own liking. Nothing will.**. And me being sad is dangerous. It's bad. I'm just a pretty shit person in general. Even when I'm happy I sound insane. Maybe I really am? I'm just trying to be kind, not selfish, considerate. I'm trying to fix things and they still manage to fall apart. Might as well just die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself"" and ""Might as well just die"" directly express suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), despair (""unexplainable void and sadness""), self-loathing (""pretty shit person""), and isolation.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - No references to past attempts or actions taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. ""Kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). Questions (""Should I...?"") reflect contemplation, not planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current feelings and thoughts. Mentions recurring sadness but no past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire qualifies as 'ideation'. Absence of plans/preparations rules out 'behavior'. No past attempts exclude 'attempt'. Hopelessness alone would be 'indicator', but explicit suicidal intent overrides this.

I just hate them that if u are not qualified to give at least average life to ur children then why u still give birth to them and suffer from u? fuck,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post includes explicit expressions like ""i should die"" and ""kill myself,"" indicating a desire to end life. It references intense hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), self-loathing, and perceived burden on family. Critically, it states ""I have prepared everything,"" implying concrete steps toward suicide. No past attempts are described; the focus is on current intent and preparation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").  
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""i should die"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - While no specific method (e.g., tools/locations) is detailed, the phrase ""I have prepared everything"" explicitly indicates tangible preparations.  
   - This moves beyond mere ideation into actionable planning per the ""behavior"" definition.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The post discusses current intentions (""made up my mind a few days ago"") and ongoing preparations (""I have prepared everything""). No reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + acknowledgment of preparations meets the threshold for ""behavior."" Absence of method specificity is overruled by the clear evidence of planning (""prepared everything""), aligning with the ""behavior"" definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes phrases like ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and ""a pistol,"" which imply a plan to die by suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of hopelessness (""I will have nothing to look forward to"") and feelings of being unwanted (""my roommates will be tired of my presence,"" ""they never seemed to enjoy my company"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user describes a detailed plan involving emptying their bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot with only ""a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back,"" and intending for their body not to be found. The pistol is explicitly mentioned as a method for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts; all references are to future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the intent is clear from the context (e.g., vanishing so no one finds the body, possessing a pistol for that purpose). However, per the rules, this is explicit enough to go beyond 'indicator' because it directly expresses a desire to die and not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""a pistol"" is identified as the tool for ending life.
   - Signs of preparation are present: Detailed steps include emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, traveling to a secluded location, and carrying the pistol.
   - This indicates explicit planning, so it aligns with 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to future intentions (""When that happens I will,"" ""I would want to vanish""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die and vanish) and a specific plan with a method (pistol) and preparations, fitting the 'behavior' category. It is not 'indicator' because suicide is implicitly but clearly expressed; not 'ideation' because a plan is detailed; and not 'attempt' because it describes future intent, not past actions.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"", ""when i do do it""). It describes hopelessness (""i dont want the existance ive got"") and disconnection. Critically, it details a specific plan: choosing woodlands as a location, preparing notes to warn dog walkers, and intentionally isolating others to facilitate the act. While the rope is mentioned as not yet acquired, the location and warning system constitute explicit planning. No past attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Direct phrases include ""suicidal,"" ""when i do do it,"" and ""making it easier to do something"" (contextually referring to suicide).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. Specifics include:  
   - Location: ""woodland where i would do it.""  
   - Preparations: Leaving notes on paths to warn others and instruct them to call police.  
   - Logistical planning: Avoiding home to delay discovery.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to long-term suicidal feelings (10 years) but focuses on *current* plans and preparations. No description of past suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (ideation) is present.  
   - Specific plans (location, notes, isolation strategy) meet the **behavior** threshold, as they outline actionable steps. The absence of immediate means (e.g., rope) is noted, but explicit planning dominates.

   - Direct desire to die: Implied by ""tonight's the night"" and hopelessness.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., tools/substances) described.  
   - ""Tonight's the night"" indicates timing (imminence) but lacks concrete details about means.  
   - Uncertain about explicit planning → lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' per rules.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""tonight""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire confirmed (""suicidal""), placing it beyond 'indicator'.  
   - Lack of specific method/preparation → falls under **ideation** (explicit desire without plan).  
   - ""Tonight's the night"" suggests urgency but is vague; rules prioritize absence of concrete plans for 'ideation'.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""cutting an artery"" (a lethal self-harm method) and ""oxy"" (oxycodone, a substance).  
   - It explicitly questions using oxy to ""lessen the pain"" during the act, indicating active consideration of the method.  
   - No emotional descriptors (e.g., hopelessness) or past attempts are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - While ""suicide"" isn’t explicitly stated, ""cutting an artery"" is an unambiguous method of lethal self-harm, implying intent to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are named: ""cutting an artery"" and using ""oxy"" to facilitate the act. The post seeks practical advice about pain reduction, signaling preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The language (""wouldn’t taking oxy..."") focuses on future intent, not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The combination of a specific lethal method (artery cutting) and substance use (oxy) for pain mitigation constitutes explicit planning. This exceeds passive ideation and aligns with ""behavior.""

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses a friend's prediction that the writer will die or kill themselves, but the writer does not personally express any desire for death, suicide, or self-harm. Instead, the writer focuses on feeling hurt by the friend's comments, seeking advice on handling the situation, and managing mental illness (BPD and CPTSD). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts by the writer. Emotional indicators include distress and upset over the friend's words, but not hopelessness or despair related to the writer's own suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the context of the friend's statements (e.g., ""she thinks I'm going to kill myself"" and ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide""), but these are not the writer's own expressions. The writer does not state any personal desire to die, end their life, or not be alive. Since the mentions are attributed to someone else and not self-expressed, this does not qualify as explicit suicidal ideation from the writer. Leaning toward 'indicator' due to lack of personal expression.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described by the writer. The post is about interpersonal conflict and emotional reactions, not planning or behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post references a past conversation with the friend, but there is no description of past suicide attempts by the writer or current/future suicidal intentions. The writer emphasizes fighting mental illness, which suggests a focus on coping rather than self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The writer expresses general distress and hurt from the friend's comments but does not explicitly state any suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. Mentions of suicide are solely from the friend's perspective, not the writer's. According to the rules, suicide risk is based only on the writer, and without explicit personal expression of suicidal desire, this fits the 'indicator' category. The definition states that even large general dissatisfaction or hopelessness without explicit suicide mention is 'indicator'. Doubts about explicit mention also default to 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

71,"please please please help me. please help im at my window right now with scissors, i feel like im about to cut the screen and jump out. i dont know what to do- im only a teen, my parents and siblings are asleep. i dont know what to do-",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post includes ""jump out"" (implying suicidal action) and ""cut the screen"" with scissors (self-harm/preparatory action).
   - Emotional indicators: Desperation (""please please please help me""), hopelessness (""i dont know what to do""), and vulnerability (""im only a teen"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: Explicitly states being at the window with scissors, about to cut the screen and jump out—indicating a specific method (jumping from height) and immediate preparation (tools and location).
   - References to past attempts: None mentioned; all context is current/imminent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump out"" strongly implies a desire to die. However, per rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'. But here, the action described is self-harming with suicidal intent, so it exceeds 'indicator'. The expression ""about to jump out"" is an explicit desire to not be alive, supporting 'ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods mentioned: ""cut the screen and jump out"" using ""scissors"" as a tool, at a ""window"" location—clear plan details.
   - Signs of preparation: ""at my window right now with scissors"" shows active preparation and imminent action.
   - No uncertainty; this is explicit planning, so 'behavior' applies over 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""right now,"" ""about to""), not past events. No history of attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to jump out, implying death) and details a specific plan (method: jumping, tool: scissors, location: window), fitting 'behavior'. It is not 'indicator' due to explicit suicidal intent; not 'ideation' due to the plan; not 'attempt' as it describes imminent action, not past events.

72,i'm gonna overdose on iron pills. i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it. i'm sorry,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""overdose on iron pills,"" which directly implies self-harm with lethal intent. It expresses emotional distress through ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it,"" indicating hopelessness and a desire to escape suffering. The phrase ""i'm gonna"" suggests immediate intent, and ""i'm sorry"" may imply farewell. There is no reference to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""overdose on iron pills"" is an unambiguous expression of intent to die, as overdosing is a common suicide method. The statement ""i don't wanna deal with it"" directly conveys a desire not to be alive. Thus, this goes beyond vague distress and is explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""overdose on iron pills,"" which identifies a means (iron pills) and a method (overdosing). This constitutes explicit planning, as it details how the act would be carried out. No preparation (e.g., having pills in hand) is described, but the method itself is sufficient for classification.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post uses future tense (""i'm gonna""), indicating current or imminent intent, not a past event. There are no references to previous attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal intent with a specific plan (overdosing on iron pills), aligning with the 'behavior' category. It does not describe a past action, so 'attempt' is ruled out. The specificity of the method moves it beyond 'ideation' (which lacks a plan) or 'indicator' (which lacks explicit suicide references). Rules emphasize that brief mentions of methods qualify as 'behavior,' and uncertainty should lean toward 'ideation,' but here the method is clear.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""im going to kill myself one day"" and ""might as well die"".  
   - Strong emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""i dont even know what [life] is""), despair (""i hate it!""), isolation (""no friends, nothing""), and worthlessness (""feel like a failure"").  
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., vague ""run away to a forest and die"" lacks concrete plans).  
   - No references to past attempts.  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""one day"") and hypothetical escape (college scholarship).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" is an explicit statement of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method**: Mentions ""run away to a forest and die"" but lacks actionable details (e.g., tools, timeline, location specifics).

   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") confirms **ideation**.  
   - Vague notions (e.g., ""die in a forest"") lack planning/preparation, ruling out **behavior**.  
   - No past attempts described, ruling out **attempt**.  
   - Explicit suicide mention disqualifies **indicator**.

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of hopelessness (""I hate being alive,"" ""losing more hope""), despair (""prolonging my suffering""), and a strong desire to die (""wishing that someone will just end my life,"" ""want to die"").  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" ""cowardice with killing myself"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described. The user mentions passive wishes (e.g., ""pray for some random person to murder me"" or walking through sketchy areas hoping for murder) but no active planning or actionable steps.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct statements like ""kill myself,"" ""assisted suicide,"" and ""suicidal people"" explicitly reference suicide or ending one’s life.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan or preparation**: Desires for murder/assisted suicide are hypothetical or reliant on external events. No mention of acquiring means, setting dates, or personal actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future desires (e.g., ""wishing,"" ""pray for""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, but no plan, method, or preparation is indicated. Passive wishes (e.g., hoping for murder) do not constitute a plan under the ""behavior"" definition.  
   - Rules clarification: ""Ideation"" covers explicit desires to die without a specific plan, while ""behavior"" requires actionable planning.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits ""ideation"" (explicit suicidal thoughts without plans/preparations).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/dying: Yes, ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" and ""See you all on the other side"" explicitly reference death.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and despair are present, e.g., ""I always felt unwanted,"" ""8,000 fucking days of this shithole,"" ""I can't take no more.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete suicide method. ""I think I'm going to leave"" is vague and not a specific plan.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post discusses current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die"" and ""I think I'm going to leave"" in context implies ending life). This meets the threshold for explicit suicidal thoughts, as it conveys a clear desire not to be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The phrase ""I'll experience it painfully"" suggests an expectation of pain but does not detail a method. Without explicit planning, this does not qualify for ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to die,"" ""I think I'm going to leave"") with no reference to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., gladness about dying, intention to ""leave""), which aligns with ""ideation"" (suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). There is no evidence of planning or behavior, and the context is future-oriented, not past. Although emotional distress is high, the explicit desire to die rules out ""indicator."" No plan or past attempt supports ""ideation"" over ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions extreme emotional distress: ""tired of only feeling sadness and anxiety,"" ""depression and anxiety,"" ""tired of being a burden,"" ""soul is hurting.""
   - Expresses hopelessness: ""I've tried every way to cope,"" ""happiness... out of my reach for beyond a decade.""
   - Explicit desire to escape life: ""I just don't wanna be here,"" ""want to wave the white flag"" (metaphor for surrender/suicidal ideation).
   - No references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I have to kill myself"" and ""Death is my only option right now"" directly reference suicide.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions the user's past suicidal thoughts (""he was suicidal like me some time ago"") but focuses on the user's current feelings. Key elements include expressions like ""I don't deserve, nor want to live"" and ""I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother,"" indicating a desire not to be alive. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't deserve... to live"") and self-sacrificial ideation. However, there are no mentions of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, notes), or descriptions of self-harm. References to past attempts are about another person, not the user; the user only alludes to past suicidal thoughts, not actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned for the user's current state; the word ""suicidal"" refers to the past and another person. However, there is a direct expression of not wanting to live: ""I don't deserve, nor want to live."" This is an explicit desire to not be alive, leaning toward 'ideation' over 'indicator' based on clarity.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The idea of ""donating life"" is metaphorical and not a concrete plan, so it does not indicate behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to the user's past suicidal thoughts (""some time ago"") but no past attempts. Current statements (""I don't want to live"") express present intentions without future planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The user explicitly expresses a desire not to be alive, which fits the 'ideation' definition (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan). The metaphorical wish to donate life reinforces hopelessness but lacks specificity for 'behavior.' Past references are thoughts, not attempts, and no plan exists, so 'attempt' or 'behavior' do not apply. Leaning toward 'ideation' is justified due to the direct expression of not wanting to live, but if uncertain, rules prioritize 'indicator'—however, the clarity here supports 'ideation'.

   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I'm ready to die"" and ""Hope it all ends soon"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Stopping medications/quitting therapy and unhealthy habits imply passive self-destructive behavior but **lack specificity** (e.g., no tools, locations, or concrete steps). Hoping for COVID is vague.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**ideation**), but preparations (stopping meds) are generalized self-sabotage, not a specific suicide plan. Hoping for COVID is indirect.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains expressions of deep emotional distress, such as ""broken remainings of my soul"" and a desire to be ""free from all this pain."" However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The phrase ""I just want to disappear"" suggests a wish to escape suffering but does not directly reference suicide or dying.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""all this pain""), but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The language is vague and metaphorical (e.g., ""disappear""), so it does not clearly state a desire to end life. Since it is unclear, the reasoning leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The focus is on emotional pain, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post expresses current feelings (e.g., ""I just want"") and does not refer to past events or attempts. It centers on present distress rather than historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows significant distress and a wish to escape pain but lacks explicit suicidal intent or planning. Per the category definitions, ""indicator"" applies because there is no direct mention of suicide or a desire to die—only general hopelessness. The rules specify that when in doubt about explicitness, 'indicator' should be chosen over 'ideation'.

   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means) are described; the phrase ""I just need a plan"" indicates contemplation but not an existing plan.
   - Since no explicit plan is detailed, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current/future intentions (e.g., ""I just need a plan""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"") but lacks any specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' definition.
   - The mention of needing a plan is not equivalent to describing a plan, so it does not meet the 'behavior' threshold.
   - There are no past attempts described, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Explicit suicide references rule out 'indicator'.

I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly,"" and simulating suicide with a finger gun gesture (""blow my brains out"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness implied in uncontrollable utterances.  
   - Past attempts: Direct reference to a ""most recent failed attempt"" (staying in the car).  
   - No explicit current plan, method, or preparation described (e.g., acquiring tools, setting dates).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific current method/preparation. The finger gun is a gesture, not a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to recurring thoughts/gestures (current) and a **past attempt** (""most recent failed attempt"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempt explicitly described → **""Attempt""** (rules: ""content describes past attempts"" and ""if post refers to past attempts but mentions current plans, label as attempt""). Current suicidal phrases/gestures lack actionable plans (ideation), but the clear reference to a past attempt overrides this.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I hate my life""), despair (""lost all my sanity""), and references to lifelong abuse/bullying.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""do not want to live anymore"" and ""suicidal"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations. Focus is on emotional state and societal treatment.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Suicidal feelings (""do not want to live anymore"") are expressed as current. Past context involves abuse/bullying, not suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire qualifies for **ideation**, but absence of specific plans/preparations rules out **behavior**. No past suicide attempts described. Emotional distress alone would be **indicator**, but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to **ideation**.

They'll happily talk away while I listen but the second i try and tell a story of my own they shut off completely, let alone if I try to be open about how much I'm struggling. I started college this year and its been so horrible. I was robbed of a place to stay so I've had to live at home while everyone else has parties and enjoys their college experience.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""endless torment,"" ""horrible"" college experience, feeling isolated) and explicitly states ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day.""  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts.  
   - Focuses on current despair and a direct wish to die to escape suffering.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" is an explicit, direct expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No details about methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations. The statement is a declaration of intent without actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intentions** (""I'd rather kill myself now""). No past attempts referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") places it beyond *indicator* (which requires no explicit suicide mention).  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods rules out *behavior* (which requires explicit planning).  
   - No description of past actions rules out *attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kill myself,"" ""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""every single day I still have the urge""), fear, guilt about leaving pets/friends.
   - Specific method: Firearm (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").
   - Preparation/plan: None described (e.g., no note, weapon acquisition, or location setup).
   - Past attempts: Not mentioned; focuses on current urges and hesitation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct expressions like ""kill myself"" and ""blow my brains out.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: Firearm is explicitly named (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").  
   - **Signs of preparation**: None indicated (e.g., no reference to owning a gun or setting a date).  
   - *Decision*: Method is specified, but no evidence of actionable steps. Rules state: ""If unsure about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes **current/future** urges (""every single day,"" ""urge to just blow my brains out""), not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (supports *ideation* or *behavior*).  
   - Specific method mentioned, but no planning/preparation (rules: lean toward *ideation* if uncertain about planning).  
   - No past attempt described.  
   - *Key rule*: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.""  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits **ideation** (explicit desire to die + method referenced, but no actionable plan or preparation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains direct pleas for death (""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life""). It includes a specific preparatory action (""i'll dm the address"") to facilitate the requested death. There are strong expressions of despair (""horrible life"") but no references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my horrible life"" are explicit expressions of a desire to die, even though framed as a request for murder. The core intent is termination of the writer's life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The offer to ""dm the address"" constitutes a specific preparation to enable death (by murder), meeting the criteria for planning. The method (murder) is explicitly stated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to immediate future intentions (""please come here""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die qualifies for at least 'ideation'. 
   - Specific preparation (providing address) moves this to 'behavior' per the definition requiring ""preparations taken"" or explicit planning. 
   - No past attempts described.  
   - Rules clarify that focus is on the writer's risk (requesting murder still reflects their suicidal intent and planning).

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city. I haven't dated in years (I don't think I'm very attractive tbh, but this doesn't bother me that much). My family is nuts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness (""I don't see a way out""), and passive death-related thoughts (""things would be better if I didn't have to try anymore""). However, it explicitly denies active intent (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen""). There are no references to self-harm methods, preparations, plans, or past suicide attempts.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit statements about wanting to die or commit suicide (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""). The phrase ""didn’t have to try anymore"" implies weariness but not explicit suicidal desire.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No mention of tools, locations, preparations, or methods for suicide.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current emotional state and life circumstances; no references to past suicide attempts.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post shows severe hopelessness and passive death ideation (""things would be better if I didn’t have to try anymore""), it lacks explicit suicidal intent, plans, or behaviors. The direct denial of deliberate self-harm (""I don't think I'm gonna deliberately make it happen"") and absence of suicidal specifics align with **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger"" and ""i still thought about suicide,"" which are explicit references to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i can't keep getting false hope that i'll actually end up happy""), despair (""crushed and empty""), and distress (""this is too hard""). There are no specific methods, plans, or preparations described (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions). No references to past suicide attempts; the ""anniversary"" is vague and not linked to a suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""thought about suicide."" There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive, such as the intensifying suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on thoughts and feelings, not actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current suicidal thoughts and emotions (e.g., ""today is the anniversary,"" ""my suicidal thoughts get stronger""). Past events are described in terms of emotional states (e.g., feeling ""ok"" or ""crushed"") but not past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts places this beyond 'indicator' (which requires no explicit suicide reference). The absence of a specific plan or preparation rules out 'behavior.' There is no description of past suicide actions, so 'attempt' does not apply. Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as the content expresses a desire to not be alive without detailing a plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I am planning to kill myself tonight,"" indicating suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Everyone who could help me is asleep,"" ""I expect nothing from no one"") and personalization of the issue (""my problem, my illness""). There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no mention of how the act will be carried out). No references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""). 
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""planning to kill myself tonight""). 
   - This is clear, so it moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described. The phrase ""tonight"" indicates a timeframe but does not detail a concrete plan. 
   - Since no explicit planning is evident, and the rules state to lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain, this points to 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""tonight""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a general timeframe (""tonight""), but lacks any description of a specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It does not meet the 'behavior' threshold, as no explicit planning details are provided, and 'attempt' is for past actions only. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit suicide mentions.

   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly states ""I want to die"" and ""I want to disappear."" Also references future intent: ""one day I will take myself away from here so I can't hurt anyone.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I feel like one day I will hurt someone""), self-loathing (""I'm a piece of shit""), and despair (""I am on the edge"").

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions feelings of worthlessness (""I feel like trash""), hopelessness (""I don't have any purpose in life""), and a desire not to exist (""I just don't want to exist""). However, the user explicitly denies suicidal thoughts (""I'm not suicidal or something"") and states that suicide is selfish. There are references to past events (lockdown, anxiety attacks) but no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned, but in the context of denial (""I'm not suicidal"") and a general opinion (""suicide is selfish""). The phrase ""I just don't want to exist"" expresses a desire not to be alive but is not an explicit statement of wanting to die by suicide, especially given the denial. Since there is doubt about explicit suicidal intent, this leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The content does not indicate any planning or behavior related to suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings of distress and references past events (e.g., lockdown, anxiety attacks), but there is no mention of past suicide attempts or future plans. The denial of suicidality and lack of action further support that this is about present emotional state.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of distress, hopelessness, and a wish not to exist, but the user explicitly denies being suicidal and discusses suicide only in abstract terms. There is no explicit desire to die by suicide, no plan, and no behavior. According to the rules, general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicidal mention (or with denial) should be classified as 'indicator'. The doubt about explicit ideation also directs leaning to 'indicator'.

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide: ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""I want to take my life,"" and discussions about suicide as an escape.
   - Strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and worthlessness are present (e.g., ""never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness"").
   - Specific reference to a **past suicide attempt**: ""I attempted suicide last week... my attempt had failed.""
   - No current plan/method/preparation details for future suicide; focus is on the past attempt and its aftermath.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Phrases like ""take my life"" and ""suicidal"" are explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific current methods, tools, or preparations described. The only actionable detail refers to a **past attempt**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Explicitly describes a **past attempt** (""last week"") and its failure. Current expressions are ideational but do not indicate active planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post meets the **Attempt** category: It details a concrete past suicide action (unfinalized note, failed attempt) and reflects on its aftermath. While current distress and ideation exist, the core event is a documented past attempt. Rules specify that past attempts warrant the 'attempt' label even if current plans are mentioned.

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post explicitly asks about lethal dosage of Valium (""How much valium does it take to kill you?"") and expresses a desire for death (""I just want this nightmare to end"").
   - Emotional indicators: Phrases like ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" and ""I just want this nightmare to end"" indicate despair and hopelessness.
   - Specific plans/methods: Valium is mentioned as a method for suicide, and ""I haven't taken enough"" implies preparation (i.e., the person has already ingested some, indicating action taken).
   - References to past attempts: None; the context is current (e.g., ""haven't taken enough"" suggests ongoing behavior).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly implied through ""kill you"" (directly tied to the self via context) and ""I just want this nightmare to end,"" which expresses a clear desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific method: Valium overdose is mentioned.
   - Signs of preparation: ""I haven't taken enough"" confirms the person has already taken steps (ingested Valium), indicating active behavior toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current intentions and actions (e.g., taking Valium now), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond mere thoughts (ideation) due to the explicit mention of a method (Valium) and evidence of preparation (having taken some). This fits the 'behavior' category, which requires explicit planning or actions. It is not 'attempt' because no past suicide attempt is described—only current behavior. It is not 'indicator' or 'ideation' due to the specificity and action taken.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""I don't want to live at all,"" references to ""suicide attempts,"" and descriptions of specific past actions (e.g., swallowing pills, cutting neck, overdose).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't want to live at all"") and confusion about surviving accidents.  
   - Specific plans/methods: Detailed accounts of past suicide methods (sleeping pills, razor blade, prescription cocktail).  
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly describes 3 suicide attempts (age 16 and November 2020).  
   - No current plans or preparations mentioned; all suicidal actions are historical.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct statements include ""suicide attempts,"" ""suicide note,"" and descriptions of self-harm with suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are mentioned but only in the context of **past attempts** (e.g., swallowing pills, using a razor, overdosing). No current plans or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - All suicidal actions are explicitly framed as past events (e.g., ""first one came when I was 16,"" ""November 2020""). The motorcycle incident is described as accidental, not intentional.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details **past suicide attempts** with specific methods and outcomes.  
   - Current expressions (""I don't want to live at all"") indicate ideation but are secondary to the historical focus.  
   - Rules specify: If past attempts are described, classify as **'attempt'**, even if current ideation is present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""kill myself"", ""I'm ready to be done"", and ""just doing it"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""All failing""), despair (""I'm so stressed""), and worthlessness (""I'm fucking everything up"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: Describes putting ""a belt around my neck"" and using a ""doorknob in the closet"" to attempt suffocation.  
   - Preparations: Details actions taken (""sat down against the doorknob"") and near-fatal outcome (""Right before I passed out"").  
   - References to past attempts: None (the belt incident is described as recent/current).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself""). Direct expressions of wanting to die (""I’m ready to be done,"" ""I’m so close to just doing it"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Belt around the neck, leveraging a doorknob for pressure.  
   - Preparation/action: Actively engaged in the behavior (""put a belt,"" ""sat down,"" nearly passed out).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current intentions (""tonight"") and imminent risk (""push me one more inch""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent and a specific method (belt/doorknob) with documented action place this under **behavior**. Though the act was interrupted, the detailed planning and partial execution meet the threshold for ""explicit planning"" and self-harming behavior. Rules prioritize ""behavior"" over ""ideation"" when methods are specified.

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like ""too tired of life"" expressing hopelessness and despair. There is no mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. Instead, it discusses fear and legal consequences (""suicide is illegal here so if I fail I might get arrested or fined""), which are deterrents rather than plans. No references to past attempts are present.

2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""kill myself,"" and there is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive (""too tired of life"").

3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, notes) are described. The focus is on fear and hypothetical outcomes, not concrete plans. Due to uncertainty about planning, the reasoning leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT:
   - The post refers to current feelings and future hypotheticals (""if I fail""), not past events or attempts. It is not describing a historical action.

5. CATEGORY REASONING:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""too tired of life"") but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which covers explicit expressions of a desire to die without a plan. The fear and legal concerns do not constitute planning or behavior, and there is no indication of past attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - Explicit future intention: ""taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good.""  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""End this bullshit for good"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die (Yes).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""no motivation to even get up in the morning""), despair (""i have no one left to turn to""), and isolation (""i spend most of my time in my room""). It includes explicit wishes for death: ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"". There are no references to past suicide attempts, specific preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or concrete plans. The methods mentioned (e.g., being hit by a car or overdosing) are framed as desires, not actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes, the phrase ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds"" constitutes an explicit expression of wanting to die or not be alive, even though the word ""suicide"" isn't used directly. This goes beyond vague feelings of distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods (e.g., ""od on meds"") are mentioned, but there is no indication of planning, preparation, or intent to act (e.g., no details on timing, location, or means acquisition). The context is a wish, not a plan, so it doesn't meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The content focuses on current feelings and desires, with no references to past suicide attempts or actions. All expressions are in the present tense, relating to immediate emotional state.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit desire to die through specific methods aligns with 'ideation' (expressing suicidal thoughts without a plan). It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of planning or preparation, 'attempt' due to no past actions, or 'indicator' because the suicide-related desire is explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger, resentment, and despair about the author's physical appearance (""ugly person's body"") and perceived life disadvantages. It describes life as ""daily torture"" and envies attractive people. Key elements include hopelessness (""unwanted in literally all facets of life""), worthlessness, and a wish to trade everything for a different life (""I would give absolutely everything...""). No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm appear.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **No**. Phrases like ""jump out of bed"" are metaphorical (referring to enthusiasm, not self-harm). No direct expressions of wanting to die or end life.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **None**. No methods, tools, locations, preparations, or references to suicide notes.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current/persistent suffering and hypothetical wishes (""if I was born that way""). No references to past actions or attempts.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and life dissatisfaction, it **lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or references to past attempts**. The metaphorical language doesn't meet the threshold for ""ideation"" or ""behavior."" Per rules, extreme hopelessness without explicit suicide mention defaults to **indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""me being suicidal"" explicitly, indicating current suicidal thoughts. It also references past actions: ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times,"" which describes actual suicide attempts. Emotional indicators include distress from abuse, mental illness, and frustration with others' dismissal (""I'm tired of people's ignorance""). There are no specific methods, plans, or preparations mentioned for current suicide intentions; the focus is on past events and general suicidal feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""suicidal"" and ""kill myself."" This rules out 'indicator' as the category.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are described for current intentions. The phrase ""tried to kill myself"" refers to past actions without detailing methods, so this does not indicate current planning. Thus, 'behavior' (which requires explicit current plans) is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"") as concrete historical actions. It also includes current suicidal feelings (""me being suicidal""), but no current plans are expressed. The category rule states that if past attempts are described, label as 'attempt' even if current ideation is present.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is the description of past suicide attempts, which directly aligns with the 'attempt' category definition (""describes past attempts at suicide""). The mention of current suicidal ideation does not override this, as the rule specifies that posts referencing past attempts should be labeled 'attempt' regardless of current elements. There is no evidence of current planning, so 'behavior' is not appropriate, and 'ideation' is secondary to the historical actions described.

   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""Better off dead"" is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive (Yes).  
   - This qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (tools, substances), locations, or preparations are described (No).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to a recurring statement (""when I say""), not a past attempt or concrete future plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""better off dead"") meets the threshold for **ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out ""behavior""; no past actions rule out ""attempt"".

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""overdose"" and specifies taking ""44 paracetamol almost an hour ago,"" indicating a recent act of self-harm.  
   - Physical symptoms (stomach pain, sweating, shaking) suggest an ongoing medical crisis.  
   - Emotional distress is evident (""feel like a burden""), but the core focus is the overdose action.  
   - No references to past attempts or future plans beyond the current situation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). However, overdose is a direct method of self-harm with lethal potential.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A specific method (44 paracetamol) and timing (""almost an hour ago"") are provided. The act has already occurred.  
   - Preparations are implied (ingesting pills).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - The overdose happened recently (current behavior), not in the past.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The user describes an **active self-harm incident** (ingesting pills) with severe physical symptoms.  
   - This fits **Behavior**: explicit expression of suicidal thoughts is absent, but a specific, life-threatening action (overdose) has been taken.  
   - Rules clarification: ""Behavior"" includes self-harm with lethal means (here, paracetamol overdose), even if intent is ambivalent (""i dont think i want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""End it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide/dying, explicitly expressing a desire to not be alive.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The post explicitly states uncertainty about ""how, when or anything else,"" confirming the absence of a plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit desire to die meets the threshold for **ideation**. The lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out ""behavior,"" and the absence of past actions rules out ""attempt."" The explicitness of the suicidal intent disqualifies ""indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses a bipolar diagnosis, therapy, and personal struggles including past depression, mental breakdowns, and feelings of loneliness. 
   - Key phrases: ""nothing lower but death"" (metaphorical reference to rock bottom), ""almost being abusive,"" and descriptions of past hardships. 
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, death wishes, methods, plans, or preparations. The word ""death"" appears only in a general comparative context (""nothing lower but death""). 
   - Emotional tone includes distress but also hope, self-acceptance, and encouragement to others.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""plan on ending it soon"" directly expresses intent to die.  
   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming guilt, hopelessness (""i dont know what else to do"").  
   - Specific method mentioned: Overdosing on ibuprofen is explicitly stated as the ""go-to plan"".  
   - Preparations/timing: Uncertainty about timing (""tonight or this week"") but clear intent.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""ending it soon"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (ibuprofen overdose) is identified, qualifying as a plan.  
   - Uncertainty about pain/efficacy doesn’t negate the explicit plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""tonight or this week""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific method (ibuprofen) = **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: Mentioning a method (even briefly) moves this from 'ideation' to 'behavior'.  
   - Fear of pain doesn’t downgrade the classification.

I honestly think some people are born/meant to be fucked up so as to be a metric for others to measure themselves against. So don't be like me I guess.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: ""If I had a gun I'd kill myself"" explicitly states suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like shit,"" hopelessness about the future, self-loathing (""born/meant to be fucked up"").  
   - Plan/method: Hypothetical method (gun) is mentioned but conditional (""if I had"") with no evidence of preparation.  
   - Past attempts: No references to prior suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""I'd kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method (gun) is specified but hypothetical. No signs of access, preparation, or imminent action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""right now,"" ""future""). No past attempts described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention: ""i just wanna kill myself"" directly expresses suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness about secondhand smoke exposure (""impossible to avoid""), fear of lung cancer, and frustration with parental dismissal.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described for suicide.
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" is an unambiguous expression of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: The post describes a *reason* for suicidal thoughts (fear of cancer) but lacks any mention of plans, means, or methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current suicidal thoughts (""wanna kill myself"") with no indication of past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

Goodbye reddit thanks for the support and thanks for listening.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Explicitly includes ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""move on from this worthless existence,"" indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""worthless existence"") and despair (""These past years have shit""), along with anticipation (""excited to finally move on"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Refers to having ""a plan on how I can kill myself"" and intent to act ""next week,"" but no details on methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are provided.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post focuses on future intentions (""I plan on doing it next week"") and general past struggles, not past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (""excited to finally move on from this worthless existence"").
   - Clear and explicit, so not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods: Not mentioned; the plan is described generally (""a plan on how I can kill myself"") without details like tools, locations, or substances.
   - Signs of preparation: None indicated; the post states intent (""I plan on doing it next week"") but lacks evidence of actionable steps (e.g., gathering means).
   - Uncertainty: Since no explicit method or preparation is described, and the rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about planning, this leans toward 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""I plan on doing it next week""), not past events or attempts. Mentions past life experiences but no suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a general plan, but without specific methods or preparations. This fits the 'ideation' category (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It does not meet the 'behavior' threshold due to lack of method details, nor 'attempt' (no past actions), and is too explicit for 'indicator'.

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions a history of suicidal thoughts and a past suicide attempt (""I have attempted suicide in the past""). It also references current recurrence of suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again""). There are expressions of hopelessness (e.g., chronic pain limiting mobility) but no mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intent to act on current suicidal thoughts.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Suicidal thoughts"" and ""attempted suicide"" are explicitly stated.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for current suicidal actions are described. The focus is on past actions and current thoughts without planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The suicide attempt is explicitly framed as a past event (""many years ago""). Current suicidal thoughts are mentioned but lack plans or behavioral indicators.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **past suicide attempt** (historic action), which falls under the ""Attempt"" category.  
   - Though current ideation is present, there is no evidence of active planning or imminent behavior.  
   - Rules specify: ""When a post refers to past attempts [...] label it as 'attempt'."" (even if current thoughts exist).  
   - Since ""attempt"" focuses on historical actions and overrides concurrent ideation per guidelines, this is not ""ideation"" or ""behavior.""

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep emotional distress, feelings of isolation, fear of abandonment, and mentions ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm). It explicitly references self-harm (""I can't even cut"") as a coping mechanism but states an inability to act due to fear of being discovered. There is no mention of death, dying, suicide, or specific plans/methods for suicide. Past attempts are not referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not be alive. ""Thoughts of sh"" refers to self-harm, not suicide.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. The barrier to self-harm (bf discovering cuts) is situational, not indicative of planning suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current struggles; no references to past suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post shows severe distress and self-harm ideation, it lacks explicit suicidal intent, plans, or references to suicide. Self-harm (sh/cutting) is distinct from suicidal behavior per the guidelines. General hopelessness without explicit suicide mention falls under **indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying: Yes, the post includes phrases like ""when I die"" and ""if I'm dead,"" indicating a focus on death.
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses hopelessness and despair, such as ""my pain is finally over"" and ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead,"" suggesting that death is seen as the solution to suffering.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No details are provided about how the death might occur (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, substances, or actions like writing a note). The content is abstract and focused on the outcome (death) rather than execution.
   - References to past attempts: None; the language is future-oriented (""when I die"") and hypothetical.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, there is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive, e.g., ""the only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead."" This is an explicit statement of wanting to be dead, which aligns with suicidal ideation. Since it is clear, it leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator.'

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, setting a date) are described. The post remains at the level of desire without actionable steps. Given the uncertainty about planning, the category should default to 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to future intentions (""when I die"") and current feelings (""my pain is finally over""), not past events or attempts. There is no indication of historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains an explicit expression of a desire to be dead to end suffering, fitting the 'ideation' definition: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan."" It does not meet 'behavior' due to the absence of planning or methods, and it is not 'attempt' as it discusses the future, not the past. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the desire to be dead is explicit and personal (focused on the writer), ruling out 'indicator.'

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""kill myself"" and expresses a strong desire not to live (""I don't want to live""). It also indicates hopelessness and despair through statements such as ""my life is all downhill,"" ""I have nothing in my life,"" and a farewell (""goodbye"").
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past attempts; the focus is on current/future intentions (e.g., ""I finally decided"" and ""goodbye"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I don't want to live"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or signs of preparation are described. The phrase ""take the leap"" is metaphorical and does not indicate a concrete plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (e.g., ""finally decided"" implies imminent action), not past events. The mention of being helped ""stay here about a month longer"" refers to past ideation, not a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"") without any specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' category. It does not meet the threshold for 'behavior' (which requires explicit planning) or 'attempt' (which requires description of past actions). The explicit suicide mention rules out 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" and ""finally ending,"" which are explicit references to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" despair about the last year, and relief at the idea of ending life). No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described (e.g., no mention of how suicide will be carried out). No references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on the past year as a negative experience, not a past action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits,"" which are clear euphemisms for suicide. Direct expressions of wanting to die include ""I feel so relaxed that it's finally ending"" and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me."" This is not vague; it explicitly indicates a desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are mentioned. The act of playing a video game ""one last time"" could imply impending action but does not constitute explicit planning or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the rule dictates choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""before i end it all,"" ""finally ending""), not past events. There is no description of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' definition. It does not meet 'behavior' due to lack of explicit planning, nor 'attempt' as there are no past actions described. It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

   - Author expresses fear and concern for the friend's safety but no personal expressions of death, suicide, self-harm, hopelessness, or despair about *themselves*.  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""I will hang myself now"" and ""kill me with it"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (e.g., ""nobody has ever liked me""), despair, isolation.  
   - Specific plan/method: Mentions hanging as a method and actively seeks tools (""looking for something to tie"").  
   - Preparation: Actively searching for materials to execute the plan.  
   - References to past: Mentions chronic loneliness and self-harm, but no explicit past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I just want to kill myself"" and repeated expressions like ""I want out,"" which directly reference a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?"") and despair about work overload, but these support the explicit suicidal expression.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to weapons, substances, or plans).
   - No references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on current feelings and desires.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

Not only is she harassing my friend, but she has told her things that have said 'do the world a favor and go kill yourself' as well as 'when I find you it's gonna be the fucking end of you' as well as calling her fat in every way possible. On top of this is creating photoshopped images of my friend having fake conversations towards the bully and others to, I'm guessing, make her look bad. All my best friend has done is ask for her to leave her alone and this woman won't stop. Its going on 5 days now. The woman has created 17 Instagram accounts to harass her over, as well as so far 7 phone numbers, as well as 2 Facebook accounts. It's mentally disturbing my friend at this point. She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself. This bullying woman calls herself a reverend, therapist, witch, light worker, and healer. She is also a personal trainer. HOW?!. With that being said, can I post her phone number(s) and Instagram handle(s)? Justice needs to be served.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes severe bullying directed at the author's friend, including statements like ""go kill yourself"" (made by the bully, not the friend) and threats of violence. 
   - The friend is described as overwhelmed, mentally disturbed, tired, and struggling with basic activities (eating, going out). 
   - No explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are attributed to the friend. The only suicide-related content is the bully's statement, not the friend's own words or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **No**: The friend (the subject at risk) does not explicitly mention suicide, dying, or a desire to end her life. The bully's statement (""go kill yourself"") is not an expression by the friend herself.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: No specific methods, plans, preparations, or self-harm behaviors are described for the friend.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current bullying and its effects. No references to past suicide attempts by the friend.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The friend exhibits distress (hopelessness, withdrawal) but expresses no personal suicidal ideation, plan, or history. The bully's statement does not reflect the friend's own intent. Under the rules, this fits **Indicator** (general distress without explicit suicidal expression by the subject).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"", ""suicide is on my mind everyday"", ""I want to hang myself"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing to look forward to""), isolation, self-loathing (""loser, ugly""), and despair.  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself"" directly references a suicide method (hanging).  
   - No references to past attempts or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""kill myself"", ""suicide"", ""hang myself"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: ""hang myself"" specifies a method (hanging), which qualifies as explicit planning per the **Behavior** definition.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""want to hang myself,"" ""how much longer I could last"").  
   - No description of past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts + specific method (hanging) = **Behavior**.  
   - Though ""holding on a bit"" indicates ambivalence, the explicit plan overrides this nuance per classification rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""attempted once again"" referring to a specific past action (last night), notes it as their ""15th time,"" and expresses a current desire to ""attempt again."" It also includes barriers to seeking help (financial/COVID concerns).  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes – ""attempted"" directly references suicide attempts.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, or preparations for future attempts are mentioned.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Explicitly describes a past attempt (""last night I attempted"") and references multiple past attempts (""15th time""). Current desire to attempt is noted but lacks planning details.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The core focus is on describing a recent suicide attempt (past action). The rules state: ""when a post refers to past attempts [...] label it as 'attempt'."" Current ideation (""still want to attempt"") does not override this, as the category definition prioritizes historical actions. No plan for future attempts places it below ""behavior.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling,"" ""too scared to go all the way through,"" ""sad,"" ""alone.""
   - Explicitly expresses a desire to die: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""
   - References past experiences: ""I've done this before, I know I'll wake up,"" implying prior non-lethal self-harm or suicidal behavior without death.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No description of active planning or imminent action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly named, but the statement ""I hope I don't wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting to die (Yes).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations described. Focus is on emotional state and passive desire (No).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - ""I hope I don’t wake up"" indicates a current/future wish. References to past events (""done this before"") lack details of concrete attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core is an explicit desire to die (""hope I don't wake up""), meeting the threshold for **ideation**. No plan or behavior is indicated. Past references are ambiguous (not clearly an attempt) and secondary to the current ideation. Rules prioritize ""ideation"" over ""behavior"" without explicit planning, and ""attempt"" requires a described past action (not met here).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""I could die, or the attempt could fail.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""everything is gone,"" ""Too late to turn back""), despair (""I have ran out of chances"").  
   - Specific plan/method: ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""I am going to shoot myself.""  
   - Preparations: Room emptied, accounts deleted, savings gone.  
   - Past attempts: References prior intent (""since June"") but explicitly states ""I never did it.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: Direct statements about killing oneself and shooting oneself.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (gun) and immediate access (""loaded gun by my side"").  
   - Signs of preparation: Room emptied, accounts deleted, final goodbyes.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on imminent action (""now,"" ""once I post this""), not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific method (gun) + immediate preparations → **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: ""Mentions a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" applies. ""Loaded gun"" confirms concrete planning.  
   - Past thoughts without action don't qualify as ""attempt,"" and current plans override past context.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/self-harm: Explicit references include ""tried to pass"" (euphemism for suicide attempt), ""suicidal episodes,"" leaving a suicide note, and swallowing bleach.  
   - Emotional indicators: Depression, stress, feeling unappreciated, and crying at midnight indicate distress.  
   - Specific plans/preparations: Describes swallowing bleach (specific method) and leaving a suicide note (preparation).  
   - Past attempts: Explicitly recounts a suicide attempt (""a week ago"") involving swallowing bleach.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. ""Suicidal episodes,"" ""tried to pass,"" and actions (swallowing bleach) explicitly indicate intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Swallowing bleach.  
   - Preparation: Leaving a suicide note.  
   - Clear evidence of planning/preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes a concrete past event (""a week ago"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post details a **past suicide attempt** (swallowing bleach after leaving a note). Though the user mentions current improvement, the focus is on the historical attempt. Rules specify that posts describing past attempts belong to the ""Attempt"" category, even if current plans are absent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/dying: The post references the death of the user's sibling (""lost my sibling this year""), but this is not about the user's own death or suicide. The user explicitly states ""I still want to die,"" which directly relates to suicidal feelings.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness and despair are present, such as ""lost all will to live"" and ""I still want to die.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of any methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: The user says they ""tried to pull through,"" which refers to coping efforts, not a past suicide attempt. There is no description of any self-harm or suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but there is a direct expression of wanting to die: ""I still want to die."" This qualifies as an explicit desire to not be alive, aligning with the definition for ideation. Since it is clear, it should not be classified as indicator.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are discussed. The user only expresses a desire to die without any indication of planning or actionable steps. Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past events (e.g., sibling's death, feelings after the funeral) but focuses on current suicidal thoughts (""I still want to die""). There are no references to past suicide attempts, only coping efforts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The key element is the explicit expression of a desire to die (""I still want to die""), which falls under ideation (defined as explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out behavior. No past attempt is described, ruling out attempt. While there is general distress, the direct wish to die moves this beyond indicator to ideation.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" and ""my end will only get nearer"" indicates active thoughts of self-termination. 
   - Emotional indicators: ""deepest depths,"" ""darkest corners,"" hopelessness about outcomes (""I'm fine with either outcome"" implying acceptance of death).
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (acid is framed as a coping attempt, not a suicide method).
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""thinking of suicide for months"" and ""my end will only get nearer"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., tools, substances for self-harm) or preparation described. Acid is positioned as an alternative intervention, not a means of suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to ongoing suicidal thoughts (""months on end"") and potential future outcomes, not past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, but without plans/preparations. Acid use is discussed as a *preventive* measure, not a suicide method. Meets ""ideation"" criteria: explicit desire to die without actionable plan. Rules dictate choosing 'ideation' when no explicit plan exists.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions stealing and consuming prescription hydrocodone (an opioid) and alcohol to cope with not feeling okay, expressing hopelessness (""i havent felt ok in a while and im not sure what to do""). There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The focus is on using substances for temporary relief, not for self-destructive purposes. No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (No). The language centers on seeking relief (""to feel ok"") rather than ending life. Since it is unclear and lacks explicit suicidal content, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) are mentioned. The hydrocodone and alcohol use is framed as a coping mechanism, not as a means for suicide. There are no signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., notes, acquiring means). Uncertainty about planning is not applicable here, as no suicidal intent is indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current actions (""tonight"") with no references to past suicide attempts or future suicidal intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows significant emotional distress, hopelessness, and substance misuse but lacks any explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. This fits the 'indicator' category, which includes general expressions of distress without direct suicide mentions. Even strong hopelessness is 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly referenced. Rules advise choosing 'indicator' over 'ideation' when explicit suicide mentions are absent.

   - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **No explicit mention of suicide, dying, or wanting to die**. Phrases like ""no point in living"" imply distress but lack direct suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"" is absent).  
   - Leaning toward 'indicator' due to ambiguity.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No methods, tools, locations, or preparations** mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, or notes).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on **current feelings**, not past actions or future plans. No reference to attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe hopelessness but **fails to explicitly express suicidal desire, plans, or past attempts**.  
   - Falls under 'indicator' per rules: vague dissatisfaction without explicit suicidal ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of self-harm: ""taken a fuck load of pills""  
   - Direct reference to potential death: ""might not wake up tomorrow""  
   - Emotional indicators: guilt, feeling like a burden (""my problems are my own,"" ""feel so guilty"")  
   - No reference to past attempts; focuses on current action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes, ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow"" explicitly indicates a suicidal act.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: overdose via pills (""taken a fuck load of pills"").  
   - Preparation/action: Pills were already consumed (past tense ""taken"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes a current/recent action (""taken pills"") with imminent consequences (""might not wake up tomorrow"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post describes a **completed self-harm action** (consuming pills) with clear suicidal intent and expectation of death. This aligns with **'attempt'** (historic action, even if very recent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of not wanting to live (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore""), hating being alive, and considering suicide (""kill myself"", ""should just do it now""). Emotional indicators like hopelessness (""wish i was never born"") and concern about burdening others are present.
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts; all statements are about current feelings and thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"") and there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""do not want to live anymore"", ""hate being alive"", ""should just do it now""). Therefore, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans are described. The phrase ""do it now"" is vague and refers to the idea of suicide, not a concrete method or preparation. The person states they are ""to scared to kill myself,"" indicating no imminent action. Since there is no explicit plan, this points to 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and future intentions (""should just do it now""), but there is no description of past attempts. It focuses on present ideation without historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which includes explicit expressions without a plan. The absence of past attempts rules out 'attempt', and the explicit suicide mentions rule out 'indicator'. The lack of planning or behavior confirms it is not 'behavior'.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes self-harm through hanging, with specific details: ""i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die.""
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of hopelessness or distress implied by frequent attempts, but the focus is on actions rather than explicit emotions.
   - Specific methods and preparations are described: hanging as a method, with a chair or object used to prevent death, indicating preparation.
   - References to past attempts are clear: ""i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently"" and the description of habitual behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""attempt suicide""), so this is not 'indicator'.
   - There are direct expressions of engaging in suicidal behavior, but not a current desire to die (""so i don't die"" shows intent to survive).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned (hanging), and preparations are described (using a chair/object to stand on).
   - However, this is in the context of past actions, not current planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past events: ""frequently"" indicates repeated past attempts, with no mention of current or future intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes concrete past actions (suicide attempts) with a specific method, even if they are ""half-hearted"" and non-fatal. This fits the 'attempt' category, which focuses on historic actions. It does not fit 'behavior' because 'behavior' is for current plans/preparations, and there is no indication of ongoing intent. Since past attempts are explicitly described, it is not 'ideation' or 'indicator'.

I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for. Hold on to them. Because life is temporary. And from what I've learned, not everybody gets the happy ending",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicitly mentions being ""suicidal for about 6 years"" and describes a past suicide attempt (""I had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out""). 
   - References ongoing ideation (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"") but no specific current plan, method, or preparation.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I see no point anymore"") and isolation, but these are contextual to the explicit suicide references.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**. Directly states ""I've been suicidal"" and ""I had an attempt"".

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No current method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. Past attempt lacks detail about method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Clearly references a **past attempt** (""when I was 14"") and historic ideation (""suicidal for 6 years""). Current feelings (""I don't want to go on"") are present but lack behavioral indicators.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core focus is on describing a **past suicide attempt** (""had an attempt"") and historic struggles. Rules state: ""When a post refers to past attempts... label it as 'attempt'"". Current expressions of despair are secondary to the explicit description of a past concrete action.
   - Rules override: Past attempt documentation qualifies for 'attempt' even with concurrent ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post starts with ""I am 29 still live with my parents,"" expressing potential dissatisfaction with life circumstances. The second part (""4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo"") appears to be nonsensical keyboard mashing combined with profanity (""fuck""), indicating frustration or distress. There are no mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, hopelessness, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit references to suicide, dying, or not wanting to be alive. The content shows general frustration but lacks direct suicidal expressions.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods (tools, locations, substances) or preparations (notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post references a current life situation (living with parents) and immediate frustration. No past or future suicidal actions are indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post contains no explicit suicidal language, plans, or references to past attempts.  
   - General dissatisfaction and distress (e.g., ""fuckkkkkkkk"") fall under vague expressions of emotional turmoil without suicidal intent.  
   - Per the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, the category must be **indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself"" (repeated), ""die in my sleep,"" ""start cutting again.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'll finally do it""), resignation (""I'll break killing myself regardless"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: ""figured out how to properly hang myself,"" ""increase my chances of corona if I start cutting again.""  
   - Preparations/interference: ""too much potential interference"" (acknowledges barriers).  
   - References to past attempts: ""I've done it many times"" (implies past suicide attempts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""killing myself"" is explicitly stated multiple times.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods: Hanging (""how to properly hang myself"") and cutting (""start cutting again"").  
   - Preparations: Mentions overcoming ""potential interference,"" indicating planning around obstacles.  
   - Clear intent: ""I'll finally do it"" and ""I'll break killing myself regardless.""

   - Past: ""I've done it many times"" (confirmed past attempts).  
   - Present/future: Current plans to act (""I'll finally do it,"" ""start cutting again"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes **explicit suicidal intent** (""I'll finally do it,"" ""killing myself"").  
   - It details **specific methods** (hanging, cutting) and **preparations** (managing interference).  
   - Past attempts are mentioned, but **current plans dominate** the narrative.  
   - Rules prioritize current expressions of planning: Specific methods/preparations warrant **Behavior** (over Ideation).  
   - Attempt category is ruled out because current plans are present (not solely past-focused).

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature. My brother thinks I don't have a sense of guilt or shame for being a lazy bastard. Jokes on him my mind is using daily doses of guilt and shame to keep reminding that I'm in hell. I hate myself for everything I've done, everything I am now and everything that I do coz I am a fuck up whom nobody would ever like.

   - Explicit mentions of past suicide methods: drowning, hanging, and jumping from a building.
   - No current plans, preparations, or future intent described.
   - References to past attempts (""I tried... chickened out each time"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly referenced through descriptions of actions (""drown myself,"" ""hang,"" ""jump off"").

   - Specific methods are mentioned (drowning, hanging, jumping), but these are past attempts, not current plans or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - All suicide-related statements refer to past events (""tried,"" ""chickened out""). No current/future intentions indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the suicide risk lies in the detailed descriptions of **past suicide attempts** (drowning, hanging, jumping). Though aborted, these constitute concrete past actions under the ""Attempt"" definition. Current expressions align with ideation, but the explicit recounting of past attempts takes precedence per category rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end it"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes explicit phrases like ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" and ""I'm going to die."" This indicates a direct focus on self-inflicted death.
   - Emotional indicators: There is a tone of hopelessness and acceptance of death (e.g., ""cushion the pain,"" wanting to ""look like a skeleton""), but the primary emphasis is on the suicidal plan.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method is clearly stated as using anorexia to starve to death, with specific goal weights (78 pounds or lower) and the intent to make death slow and accepted by others. This shows active preparation and a chosen method.
   - References to past attempts: None are mentioned; the context is entirely forward-looking.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""kill myself"" is a direct and unambiguous expression of suicidal intent. Other phrases like ""kill me"" reinforce this.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: Anorexia is described as the means to ""slowly kill"" the person, with detailed weight targets (78 pounds, potentially lower) to ensure lethality. This constitutes a specific plan involving self-harming behavior.
   - Signs of preparation: Setting ""goal weights"" and adjusting them for the purpose of causing death indicates active preparation. Since the method and intent are explicit, this goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current and future intentions (e.g., ""I'm going to,"" ""new goal weight,"" ""will give people time""). There are no references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expressions (""kill myself"") and a specific plan (using anorexia with defined weight goals to cause death). This aligns with the 'behavior' category, which requires explicit suicidal thoughts coupled with a plan or preparation. It does not fit 'ideation' because a method is specified, nor 'attempt' as there are no past actions described. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the explicit suicide mentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly stated.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: A specific method (charcoal BBQ in a tent) is mentioned. Though phrased as a question, it directly engages with a suicide method.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: No reference to past events; focuses on a hypothetical scenario.

   - Mentions distress, hopelessness (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me""), self-loathing (""I'm an abomination""), and intrusive violent thoughts (hurting others, stabbing).  
   - Uses a **metaphor of a ""sick dog""** that must eventually be ""put down,"" implicitly comparing the dog's fate to their own state.  
   - **No explicit references** to suicide, self-harm, death, or dying (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""end my life"").  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past suicide attempts described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. The ""put down"" metaphor implies suffering but lacks direct phrasing like ""I want to die"" or ""suicide.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm/suicide are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The metaphor and expressions of despair suggest severe distress but fall short of explicit suicidal intent or planning.  
   - Violent thoughts are directed outward (hurting others) or inward as abstract desires (e.g., wanting trauma/illness), not suicide.

And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life. Anyway. Thank you for listening. I know there are hotlines, and people who would help me. I really, really appreciate that. Thank you for your time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide"" (repeatedly), ""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact,"" ""demise.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""wired different,"" ""can't click into life""), guilt/shame, exhaustion (""I am just tired"").  
   - Preparations: Drafting a will (preparatory action).  
   - Explicit denial of intent: ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" and refusal to use household weapons.  
   - Past behavior: Plotting suicide ""on and off for months"" (thoughts, not actions).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct references to suicidal thoughts (""thought of suicide,"" ""plotting my suicide"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Drafting a will is preparatory but **not a specific method** (e.g., no tools/locations/substances described).  
   - Explicitly rejects methods (""would never use a weapon"").  
   - No active planning beyond generalized ""plotting.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **recurrent thoughts** (""on and off for months"") and a past action (drafting a will).  
   - **No description of a past suicide attempt** (e.g., overdose, self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Falls under **Ideation**:  
     - Explicit suicidal desire (""plotting my suicide,"" ""suicide pact"").  
     - Preparations (will) are **non-lethal** and lack concrete plans/methods.  
     - Denies imminent intent and specifies no active plan.  
   - *Not Behavior*: No specific method/preparation for suicide (rules: choose 'ideation' if uncertain about explicit planning).  
   - *Not Attempt*: No description of past suicidal actions.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense distress (""stressed,"" ""anxiety,"" ""depressed,"" ""abused""), hopelessness (""i have no one""), and feelings of worthlessness (""he would be better off without me""). 
   - There is **no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm**. Phrases like ""better off without me"" imply low self-worth but not suicidal intent.
   - **No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts** are mentioned. The focus is on relational conflict and emotional pain.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and isolation but lack direct ties to suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **No explicit references** to suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The distress is generalized.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No methods, tools, locations, or preparations** are discussed. The content revolves around interpersonal struggles.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Describes **current emotional states** and conflicts, with no references to past suicide attempts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger, betrayal, and emotional exhaustion. Key elements include:  
   - Repeated ""fuck you"" directed at an unspecified person (""you"")  
   - References to childhood trauma (""why did you do this? [...] to a child"")  
   - Expressions of hopelessness (""i'm so tired,"" ""no more energy,"" ""world is fucked"")  
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.  
   - No descriptions of plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

I barely leave the house anymore. All I want is to have a job so I can be a normal, functioning member of society. I just want to have a sense of purpose. I want to meet new people and go places. I'm so sick of sitting inside all day, waiting for the next day in hopes it will somehow be the day where everything changes. I don't hate life, but I'm sick of _this_ life. And at this rate, I really feel like nothing is going to change. It's been so stagnant for so long.

I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses strong feelings of hopelessness, despair, and stagnation (e.g., ""I have literally nothing going for me,"" ""I'm so sick of this life,"" ""I feel like the walls are closing in and there's no escape""). It mentions life dissatisfaction, social isolation, unemployment, and a lack of purpose. However, there is an explicit denial of suicidal intent (""I don't want to kill myself""). No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts are described. The focus is on the desire for change and a better life (e.g., ""I really want to give life a chance"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned but denied (""I don't want to kill myself""). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive; instead, the person states a desire to improve their life. Since the mention is a denial and no suicidal thoughts are expressed, this leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post discusses life circumstances, not actionable suicide plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current feelings and past life events (e.g., graduating college 2 years ago, pushing friends away), but there are no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions related to suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains general distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. The denial of suicidal intent and absence of desire to die align with the 'indicator' category. Even strong dissatisfaction (""I'm sick of this life"") is classified as 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly endorsed, per the rules. There is no basis for 'ideation' (no desire to die), 'behavior' (no plan), or 'attempt' (no past actions).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts and ideations,"" ""I want to die tomorrow,"" ""I want to kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelm, hopelessness (""can't get myself to do anything anymore""), isolation (""small support system"").  
   - Plan/method: Mentions timing (""tomorrow while my mom is out"") but no specific method (e.g., tools, locations, substances). States intent but undermines it (""too weak and pathetic to do it"").  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to die,"" ""kill myself"" are explicit.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means).  
   - ""Tomorrow while my mom is out"" implies timing but lacks actionable details. Ambivalence (""I know I shouldn’t"") and self-doubt (""too weak"") weaken planning evidence.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes emotional distress, including feelings of life being ""useless,"" being ""dead inside,"" persistent sadness, anhedonia (inability to feel pleasure), and hopelessness (e.g., ""beyond saving""). There is a mention of ""yeet myself,"" which is slang for self-harm or suicide, but it is not elaborated. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no direct phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""suicide""). ""Yeet myself"" is a colloquial and indirect expression; while it implies self-destructive urges, it does not meet the threshold for being very explicit. Per the rules, when unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The phrase ""yeet myself"" is vague and lacks detail about how or when it would occur.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current emotional states and recent ""good days,"" with no references to past suicide attempts or historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content expresses general distress, hopelessness, and a desire to self-harm (""yeet myself""), but without explicit suicidal language, specific plans, or past attempts. Per the definitions:
     - **Indicator**: Fits because there is no explicit mention of suicide; the language is vague and focused on emotional suffering.
     - **Ideation**: Does not apply because there is no clear, explicit expression of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to end my life"").
     - **Behavior**: Does not apply due to the absence of any plan or preparation details.
     - **Attempt**: Does not apply as there are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.
   - Given the ambiguity around ""yeet myself,"" the rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned applies.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense distress (""i fucked up,"" ""such a fucking loser""), hopelessness (""something always fucks it up""), isolation (""no one to talk to"").  
   - Explicitly references past suicide action: ""I tried to end it once before. Sometimes i wish i succeeded.""  
   - **No current plans, methods, or preparations** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""End it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide. ""Wish I succeeded"" explicitly expresses desire for past death. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current methods, tools, or preparations mentioned. → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - ""Tried to end it once before"" and ""wish I succeeded"" refer **exclusively to a past attempt**. No current/future intent indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempt explicitly described → Fits **Attempt** (historic action).  
   - No current plan/behavior → Rules out ""behavior.""  
   - Current distress alone is insufficient for ""ideation""; focus is on past action.  
   - **Rules compliance**: Risk applies only to the author; past attempt anchors classification.

Key elements include explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") and emotional distress (""panic attack,"" ""fear""). No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""screaming at me to give up,"" ""feel more and more defeated,"" ""torture cycle,"" and ""why keep going?""  
   - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.

   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die,"" or ""end my life.""  
   - Vague expressions like ""give up"" and ""get it over with"" imply despair but are not explicit.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit mention → lean toward *indicator*.

And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses emotional distress due to others mocking the user's spiritual beliefs, leading to feelings of stupidity and being overly sensitive.
   - Explicit mention: ""I currently have suicidal thoughts"" directly references suicidal ideation.
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes) are described.
   - No references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on current thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I feel stupid,"" ""offended over everything""), but the explicit suicide reference is key.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts"").
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive (""I currently have suicidal thoughts"").
   - This is clear, so it should not be classified as 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned.
   - The post only refers to thoughts, not actionable plans. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as current (""currently have suicidal thoughts""), not past events.
   - No mention of past attempts, so 'attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression of suicidal thoughts without any plan or method aligns with the 'ideation' category.
   - It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of specific plans or preparations.
   - It is not 'attempt' because there are no descriptions of past actions.
   - Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit based on the definitions and rules.

So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions ""planning to commit suicide"" and phrases like ""have to go"" and ""end it"" as euphemisms for suicide. It expresses hopelessness (""I'll never be happy if I continue to live""), anger, and a perceived lack of alternatives. There are no references to specific methods (tools/locations), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **Yes**. Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""planning to commit suicide""), and there are direct expressions of intent (""have no choice but to end it"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **No specific plan or method**. While the term ""planning"" is used, no concrete methods, tools, timelines, or preparations are described. The wording suggests intention but lacks actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses **current/future intentions** (""planning,"" ""have to go""). No references to past attempts exist.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: Explicit suicidal intent is present, but without a specific method, plan, or preparation. This aligns with **ideation** (explicit desire to die without actionable plans). Rules prioritize 'ideation' over 'behavior' when planning is ambiguous.

I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly references ""attempting suicide"" multiple times, including phrases like ""going through with attempting suicide"" and ""I was so close to attempting suicide.""
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses distress through words like ""mortifying,"" ""embarrassing,"" ""I want to rip my hair out,"" ""nauseous,"" ""dreading,"" and ""cannot stand living with my family,"" indicating hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The references to suicide are general and lack concrete details.
   - References to past attempts: The user states they were ""so close to attempting suicide"" but did not follow through, instead texting their mother. This describes a near-attempt or intense ideation, not a concrete past action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""attempting suicide""), and there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""it was either that or going through with attempting suicide""). This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods or plans are identified (e.g., no mention of means, locations, or steps). The user only generalizes about ""attempting suicide"" without elaboration. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The suicidal references are in the past tense (e.g., ""I was so close to attempting suicide""), describing a recent crisis that was averted by texting their mother. There is no description of a concrete past attempt (e.g., an actual overdose or injury), nor any current/future plans mentioned—only past thoughts and feelings.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die to avoid moving home) but no specific plans, methods, or preparations, fitting the 'ideation' definition.
   - It does not qualify as 'behavior' because there is no mention of planning or preparation details. It does not qualify as 'attempt' because no concrete past action occurred (only a described near-attempt). It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions.
   - Applying the rules: When unsure about planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'; past thoughts alone do not constitute an 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress (""I cant take it"", ""pain makes me want to scream"", ""excruciating"") and mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly but denies intent (""I wont kill myself of course""). No references to methods, preparations, past attempts, or self-harm actions exist.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""), but it is immediately negated (""wont... of course""). The denial overrides explicit desire to die.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current emotional state without references to past actions or future plans.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit suicide mention is contradicted by denial, voiding active ideation.  
   - Distress/hopelessness alone falls under ""indicator"" per rules.  
   - Rules specify: When suicide is mentioned but disavowed, or when doubting explicit desire, default to ""indicator"".

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post discusses distress related to appearance obsession, gender dysphoria, and a desire to transition to male (""I want to be a male now""). There are emotional indicators of frustration and discomfort (e.g., ""hate wearing makeup,"" ""intensified my gender dysphoria""). No mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No references to specific plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. The content focuses on gender identity struggles, not suicidal intent. Since suicide is not mentioned, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are mentioned. The post is about internal feelings and desires, not actionable plans for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (e.g., ""I want to be a male now""), with no references to past events, attempts, or future intentions related to suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general dissatisfaction and distress (gender dysphoria) but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, plans, or behaviors. This fits the 'indicator' category, which includes non-specific distress without suicidal ideation. Even strong hopelessness or dysphoria is 'indicator' if suicide is not explicitly referenced. There is no ambiguity requiring a lean toward 'ideation' or higher.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense self-hatred and a wish for ""the courage to end it all,"" which directly references suicide. It also mentions loathing existence and enduring pain. However, it transitions to encouraging others (""you aren't alone,"" ""you are loved""), acknowledging hardship while urging perseverance. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""End it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, and ""wish I had the courage"" explicitly expresses a desire to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, plans, or preparations are described (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes). The lack of concrete plans or actions rules out ""behavior.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The language (""wish,"" ""want"") focuses on current/future desires, not past actions. No history of attempts is mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit desire to die (""end it all"") meets the threshold for ""ideation."" The absence of any plan, method, or preparation prevents classification as ""behavior."" The encouragement to others and lack of past attempts rules out ""attempt."" General distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but the explicit suicidal intent elevates it to ""ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly states ""i almost committed suicide"" and ""i still consider,"" indicating direct suicidal thoughts. It also implies a desire not to be alive with ""if my friends didn't exist i probably wouldn't be alive right now.""
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses hopelessness (e.g., ""i'm really sick of my family,"" ""i have no friends at school""), despair over anxiety worsening, and isolation (e.g., spending birthday alone).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user mentions lacking means (""i didn't have anything to do it with""), but no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are described. The consideration is vague, with no indication of current planning.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""a few days ago i almost committed suicide"" describes a past near-event, but it is not a concrete attempt (e.g., no action taken due to lack of means). This is more indicative of past ideation or intent without action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""committed suicide""), and there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""i probably wouldn't be alive right now""). This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, notes) are mentioned. The reference to lacking means (""didn't have anything to do it with"") suggests no explicit plan was formed. Since it is uncertain, the rule is to lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The ""almost committed suicide"" refers to a past event, but it does not describe a concrete action (e.g., an overdose), so it does not qualify as a past attempt. The current statement ""i still consider"" indicates ongoing suicidal thoughts without a described plan. The rules specify that past thoughts alone are not 'attempt', and there are no current plans mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""committed suicide,"" ""i still consider"") without any specific plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' definition. The past ""almost"" event is not a concrete attempt, and no current behavior (e.g., planning) is present. Rules emphasize choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' when no explicit plan is identified, and 'attempt' only for concrete past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains multiple explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" including invitations for others to join in suicide (""suicide with me,"" ""suicide together""). It expresses a desire for mutual suicide but lacks details about methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **Yes**. Suicide is explicitly stated multiple times with clear intent (e.g., ""want to suicide"").  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **No**. No specific methods (tools, locations), preparations, or timelines are mentioned.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to current/future intentions (""want to suicide too""), not past attempts.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: Explicit suicidal intent is present (pushing it beyond *indicator*), but the absence of plans/preparations rules out *behavior*. No past actions indicate *attempt*. Thus, it aligns with **ideation**.

I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kms"" (kill myself), ""hang myself right now,"" ""kill myself,"" ""put the rope around my neck,"" ""practice hung,"" ""trying again.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""burden to my family,"" ""liability,"" ""grasping at straws""), fear of failure, and inability to focus on anything except suicide.
   - Specific method/preparation: Mentions hanging as a method, details preparations (packing apartment, resigning job, money for family), and describes physically using a rope to ""practice"" hanging (though stopped due to fear).
   - Past attempts: No explicit description of past suicide attempts; the ""practice"" was a preparatory act but not a full attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct expressions include ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself,"" and ""kms.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method (hanging) and tool (rope) are mentioned. Preparations (apartment/job/finances) are discussed, and the writer admits to acting on urges by ""practicing"" with the rope around their neck.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer,"" ""trying again""). The ""practice"" hanging was recent but was aborted and not a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (Ideation) is present, but the post goes further: It describes a specific method (hanging), tools (rope), and preparatory actions (practice hanging). This constitutes explicit planning/preparation, aligning with **Behavior**. The ""practice"" is an active step toward suicide, not just a thought.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""violently suicidal,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" ""I want to be dead,"" references to past ""suicidal ideation.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm a fucking failure""), despair (""I'm so fucking overwhelmed""), isolation (""he didn't even fucking care"").
   - Method: Mentions ""get a gun"" but states uncertainty (""I don't know how exactly,"" ""I don't know though""). No explicit preparation (e.g., acquiring a gun) described.
   - Past attempts: None described. Refers to historical ideation (""my suicidal ideation"") but no actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Direct statements include ""violently suicidal,"" ""I’ll die a failure,"" ""I just want to fucking die.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire confirms it exceeds ""indicator.""
   - No specific plan/preparation rules out ""behavior."" Uncertainty about method reinforces ""ideation.""
   - No description of past suicide attempts rules out ""attempt.""

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead.

I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""end things,"" which is an explicit reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing"") and despair (e.g., ""I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself""). Specific plans or preparations are indicated by driving to the mountains with ""full intentions to end things,"" and the location (""mountains"") is mentioned as part of the plan. References to past attempts are absent; this describes a recent impulsive action that was not carried out (""I don't think I'm going to do it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""end things,"" which is a clear euphemism for suicide. Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""full intentions to end things""). This is not unclear, so it should not default to 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are not detailed, but a location (""mountains"") is explicitly mentioned as part of the plan. Preparation is evident from driving to this location with suicidal intent. Since the location is suitable for suicide (e.g., potential for jumping) and action was taken, this constitutes explicit planning per the 'behavior' definition. Uncertainty about the method is not sufficient to downgrade to 'ideation', as the preparation (driving to the location) is clear.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - This refers to a recent event (driving to the mountains) with current reflections, but no past attempts are described. The focus is on a plan that was formed and acted upon impulsively but not executed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""end things"") and mentions a plan involving preparation (driving to a specific location). This aligns with the 'behavior' category, which includes expressions of suicidal intent with any form of planning or preparation. Although no self-harm occurred, the preparatory action and location mention meet the 'behavior' criteria. It does not fit 'attempt' because no actual suicide attempt is described, and 'ideation' is insufficient due to the explicit plan elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""ready to die,"" ""preps being made,"" ""strapped in and ready to go.""

   - ""Ready to die"" explicitly expresses desire to not be alive (Yes).  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific planning: Date set, preparations underway (""Preps being made""), and implied method (""strapped in"" suggests a secured method, e.g., vehicle/device).

   - Focuses on current/future intent (""ready to go,"" preps ongoing). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., hating the course, few friends, academic failures) and despair. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described. References to past events (e.g., OCD development, school issues, panic attack) are about life struggles, not suicide attempts or self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""ending my life"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post only expresses thoughts without actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal thought (""thinking of ending my life"") is current and future-oriented. Past events described are not suicide attempts but life challenges; no history of suicide attempts is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method aligns with the ""Ideation"" category. The definition states: ""explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings... without any specific plan to commit suicide."" There is no evidence of behavior (planning/preparation) or attempt (past actions). The emotional distress supports ideation but does not elevate it to behavior, as no plan is present.

   - The post includes the phrase ""pls let me never wake up,"" which explicitly expresses a desire to not be alive. There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. No references to past attempts are present. The emotional tone suggests hopelessness about the future.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""never wake up"" is a direct expression of wanting to die/not be alive, making it explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""its working!"" is ambiguous and does not clearly indicate a suicide method or plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""let me never wake up""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""never wake up"") qualifies as suicidal ideation. However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the threshold for ""behavior."" The ambiguity of ""its working!"" is insufficient to indicate planning per the rules (when unsure, choose ""ideation"" over ""behavior""). Past attempts are not mentioned, ruling out ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit phrases: ""I really want to check out"" (repeated) and ""me unexpectedly checking out,"" which are euphemisms for suicide. Directly mentions ""suicide"" (""no moral problem with suicide"").

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses suicide methods, specifically overdosing on pills, in detail, including the process and consequences. It explicitly mentions ""commit suicide,"" ""end it with pills,"" and ""result in suicide."" However, the tone is informative and cautionary, aimed at discouraging the act. There are no emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness or despair) from the author, and no references to the author's personal experiences, plans, or past attempts. The key elements are educational, focusing on why overdosing is harmful, not on the author's own state.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""commit suicide""), but these references are general or directed at others, not expressing the author's own desire to die. There are no direct expressions from the author about wanting to die or not be alive. Since the risk applies only to the author (per rules), and no personal suicidal thoughts are stated, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods (overdosing on pills) and outcomes are described, but these are presented as general information or warnings, not the author's plan or preparation. There is no indication the author is considering or preparing for suicide. Uncertainty about planning doesn't apply here, as the author isn't expressing personal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The content is hypothetical and general, not referring to past events or the author's current/future intentions. No past attempts by the author are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, but they are not about the author's own thoughts or feelings. The author is sharing knowledge to deter others, not expressing personal distress, ideation, behavior, or attempts. For the author, the content lacks explicit suicidal expression, fitting the 'indicator' category (general discussion of suicide without personal involvement). Rules emphasize focusing on the writer, and when in doubt about personal mention, choose 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""im positive im gonna do it the the future"" implying future suicide intent.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""no motivation to keep on living"") and a trigger (""when im fed up"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No reference to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""Do it"" contextually implies suicide, but lacks explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" Leans toward 'indicator' per ambiguity rule.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (tools/substances/locations) or preparations (notes/acquiring means) mentioned. Rules require explicit planning for 'behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""gonna do it in the future""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is implied but not stated literally. Rules prioritize 'indicator' when suicide isn't explicitly mentioned.  
   - No plan/preparation rules out 'behavior'; no past attempt rules out 'attempt'.  
   - General hopelessness and future intent without explicit suicide wording align with 'indicator'.

179,I fucking hate my parents for having me. They literally just wanted a baby because 'that's part of life' and it's just resulted in a human being (me) living a life psychologically tortured. They could even find the time to care for me.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: None. The post expresses anger at parents for being born and describes feeling ""psychologically tortured,"" but there is no reference to death, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of distress, hopelessness (e.g., ""living a life psychologically tortured""), and dissatisfaction with life are present, but these are general and not tied to suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None mentioned. No discussion of tools, locations, or actions related to suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None. The post focuses on current feelings and past parental actions, not on any personal suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No).
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The content centers on resentment toward parents and existential suffering, without suicidal ideation.
   - Since it is unclear, the rule says to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Not applicable, as there are no suicidal thoughts to analyze for planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to past parental decisions and current feelings of psychological torture, but it does not discuss future intentions or past suicidal actions.
   - No past suicide attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains strong emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or suicidal thoughts. It falls under general dissatisfaction with life, which aligns with the 'indicator' category.
   - It does not meet the criteria for 'ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts), 'behavior' (which requires a plan or preparation), or 'attempt' (which describes past actions).
   - Following the rules: When in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes a vivid, terrifying dream about mass murder by foreign men, involving violence at a school and the dreamer's home. Key elements include fear, panic attacks, anxiety about sleeping, and seeking advice to avoid such dreams. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm related to the dreamer themselves. Emotional indicators include terror and anxiety, but these stem from the nightmare and its aftermath, not from personal hopelessness or despair about life. No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts are referenced.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - No explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The violence described is external (murder of others in a dream), not self-directed. Leaning toward 'indicator' as there is no indication of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations are discussed. The content focuses on the dream and its emotional impact, not on any suicidal behavior. Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not suggest 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to a past dream and current anxiety about sleeping. There is no reference to past suicide attempts or current/future suicidal intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress (panic, terror, anxiety) but lacks any explicit suicidal content. It fits the 'indicator' category, which includes general distress without direct mentions of suicide. There is no evidence of suicidal ideation (desire to die), behavior (plans/preparations), or attempts (past actions).

181,what comes after. i just need something to believe in so i can do it. i don't want to believe theres nothing. ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose. all i saw was fear and despair. please give me the strength and a reason to end this suffering,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose,"" which explicitly references a past suicide attempt via a specific method (overdose). It also includes emotional indicators like ""fear and despair"" and a desire to ""end this suffering,"" suggesting hopelessness and current distress. However, there is no mention of a current specific suicide plan, method, or preparation (e.g., tools, locations, or timing). The phrase ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" implies a current desire to act but lacks specificity about how or when.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""overdosed... on purpose"" is an explicit reference to a past suicide attempt. The current expressions (""end this suffering,"" ""do it"") suggest a desire to die but are indirect; therefore, for current thoughts, they are not explicit enough to qualify as direct expressions on their own. Leaning toward 'indicator' for current elements is not applicable here due to the explicit past attempt.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (overdose) is mentioned, but only in the context of past actions. There are no signs of current preparation or planning (e.g., acquiring means or setting a date). The current content (""give me the strength and a reason"") indicates intent but no actionable plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past events: ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose"" clearly describes a past suicide attempt. It also includes current/future intentions (""i need something to believe in so i can do it,"" ""end this suffering""), but these are not tied to specific plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (overdose on purpose), which directly fits the 'attempt' category (""describes past attempts at suicide""). The rule states that when a post refers to past attempts, it should be labeled 'attempt', even if current plans are mentioned. Here, current elements express ideation (desire to end suffering) but lack a specific plan, so they do not override the past attempt focus. 'Behavior' is not appropriate as no current plan is described, and 'ideation' is insufficient due to the explicit past action.

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide: Explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" indicating current suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (e.g., ""I thought I was getting better but all of a sudden I'm suicidal again"") and distress related to relationship strain and lack of medication.
   - Specific plans or methods: No mention of suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The reference to running out of meds is a contextual stressor but not described as a means for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""suicidal again"" implies past ideation but does not describe any concrete past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""I'm suicidal again"" is a direct expression of suicidal feelings (Yes).
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""Suicidal"" conveys a desire not to be alive (Yes).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Uncertainty: No explicit plan, so lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Focuses on current suicidal feelings (""I'm suicidal again"") and immediate stressors (e.g., medication issues). No reference to past actions or attempts beyond recurring thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""I'm suicidal again"") but no plan, method, or preparation, aligning with the 'ideation' category. The lack of specifics rules out 'behavior', and the absence of described past actions rules out 'attempt'. Explicit mention of suicide disqualifies 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes expressions of emotional distress like anxiety, hopelessness (""I can't have this life it's too painful""), and feelings of worthlessness. It explicitly mentions ""I want to die more than ever,"" indicating a desire not to be alive. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past suicide attempts. The focus is on current emotional suffering and the impact of the mother's actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""I want to die more than ever"" is a direct expression of wanting to die, making it explicit suicidal ideation. This is not vague or general distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. The post describes feelings but no actionable steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current feelings (e.g., ""now I want to die more than ever"") and general life struggles, with no mention of past suicide attempts or future plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression of wanting to die (""I want to die more than ever"") fits the ""Ideation"" category, as it shows a desire to not be alive without any specific plan. There is no evidence of behavior (e.g., methods or preparations) or attempt (e.g., past actions), and the explicit mention rules out ""Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide by hanging"" (specific method).  
   - Preparation described: ""ive alr tied the noose"" (concrete action taken).  
   - Emotional tone: Uncertainty (""still not sure"") but no explicit despair.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""suicide by hanging"" directly names the act.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Hanging is explicitly mentioned.  
   - Preparation: ""tied the noose"" confirms tangible steps taken.  
   - This exceeds ideation (desire only) due to active preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Present/future intent: ""tied the noose"" indicates current readiness, not past action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention + specific method + preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - Falls under ""Behavior"" due to actionable steps (tying the noose), even with stated uncertainty.  
   - Not ""Attempt"" (no past action described) or ""Ideation"" (plan/preparation exists).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them."" It expresses emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair related to the user's sexual feelings, but there are no references to specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""). There is also a direct expression of wanting to die (""I want to die""). This rules out the 'indicator' category.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post focuses solely on thoughts and feelings, not on planning or actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and potential future intentions (e.g., ""Should I kill myself?""), but there is no reference to past suicide attempts or events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""want to die"") place this beyond 'indicator.' The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.' With no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the post best fits 'ideation' as it conveys a desire to die without a specific plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense anger and hatred towards family members, particularly the father, due to abandonment and past sexual assault by the grandfather. Emotional indicators include despair (""i hate everything"") and hopelessness. The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" directly references a desire to end one's life, which is a common euphemism for suicide. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""i just wanna end it"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, which qualifies as explicit under the ideation definition. Therefore, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The expression is about a desire, not a plan. Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The suicidal desire (""i just wanna end it"") is expressed as a current feeling, not a past event. References to the grandfather's assault and family issues are historical, but the suicidal thought is present-tense and future-oriented. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains an explicit expression of a desire to end one's life (""i just wanna end it""), which fits the 'ideation' category. There is no indication of a specific plan or method, ruling out 'behavior'. The content does not describe a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""brink of suicide"" as a past state they avoided.  
   - Describes past coping mechanisms (becoming homeless) to escape distress.  
   - No expressions of *current* suicidal thoughts, plans, or self-harm.  
   - Emotional tone focuses on resilience and alternatives (""saved me,"" ""comfort to know it's there"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""brink of suicide""), but only as a *past* risk they did not act on.  
   - No direct expressions of *current* desire to die or end life.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.  
   - Discusses homelessness as a *coping strategy*, not self-harm.

   - All references to distress/suicide risk are past-tense (""felt like I couldn’t cope,"" ""saved me in the past"").  
   - No description of past suicide attempts—only avoidance via alternative actions.  
   - Current framing is neutral/functional (""functional member of society"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide is historical and contextual (offering alternatives), not a current expression of intent.  
   - No current ideation, plan, or behavior described.  
   - General distress and past hopelessness are present, but without *current* explicit suicidal desire or planning.  
   - Fits **indicator**: Focuses on overcoming past distress, no active suicidal expression.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""end it"" as a direct expression of suicidal intent, coupled with emotional indicators like hopelessness (""can't go on anymore""), despair (""I fucked up my life""), and isolation. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. References to being drunk and loneliness contextualize distress but do not indicate planning. The phrase ""tonight I'm just gonna be drunk and happy and then end it"" suggests future intent without concrete actionable steps.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""End it"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die, especially in the context of ""I can't go on anymore.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No. While ""tonight"" implies immediacy, there is no mention of methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to future intent (""tonight I'm just gonna... end it""). No references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: Explicit desire to die (""end it"") meets the threshold for **ideation**. Lack of specific methods/preparations rules out ""behavior.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes – ""end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Yes – specific substances (codeine/ibuprofen) are named, and possession (""I have"") indicates access to means. The question about success implies evaluation of the method.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current/future intent (""Will I be able to""), not past events.

Explicit phrases include ""desire to end"" and resisting the urge to ""keep myself alive."" No specific methods, tools, preparations, or past attempts are mentioned. Temporal context is current/persistent suffering (""everyday i ran out of reasons,"" ""suffer everyday"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Desire to end"" directly implies ending life, especially paired with ""keep myself alive."" ""Why shouldi live"" reinforces suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and discusses the probability of future suicide (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). 
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of inevitability or hopelessness about suicide, but no intense despair or immediate distress is described. 
   - There are no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) mentioned. The focus is on communicating intentions to loved ones, not on planning the act itself. 
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm actions are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:** 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commit suicide""). 
   - There is a direct expression of a desire to die or not be alive in the future (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). 
   - Since suicide is explicit, this cannot be 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, drugs) are mentioned. 
   - No signs of preparation for suicide (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described; the post is about informing others, not taking concrete steps. 
   - Uncertainty exists about whether ""telling people"" implies planning, but it is not explicit. Leaning toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** 
   - The post refers to future intentions (""will probably commit suicide eventually""), not past events. 
   - No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:** 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which includes expressions of suicidal intent without concrete plans. It does not meet the 'behavior' threshold due to the absence of planning details, and it is not 'attempt' as there is no reference to past actions. It is not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

The desire to live (""I wanna see my daughters grow up"") shows ambivalence but doesn't negate the suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""end myself,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die. This is not vague; it clearly indicates suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The suicidal thoughts are expressed but not linked to any actionable plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal thoughts (""the voices... keep telling me"") are described as current, not past. There is no mention of past suicide attempts; the only past references are to financial mistakes.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""end myself"") without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the ""Ideation"" category, defined as expressions of a desire to die without a specific plan. It does not fit ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned, nor ""Behavior"" due to the absence of planning, nor ""Attempt"" as no past suicide actions are described.

193,"a hopeful thought. now that my abusive ex is gone maybe i can find someone who cares enough to look up ways to try to help me with my mental health stuff, or who asks me about how they can help, or who even asks me how i feel about things or my opinions and just. little caring things like that. i hope i can have that one day. and even if i'm by myself for the rest of the life, i can be okay. even if i'm not okay right now. maybe i don't need to die",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses moving on from an abusive relationship and expresses hope for future support with mental health. Emotional indicators include current distress (""i'm not okay right now"") but overall hopefulness (""a hopeful thought,"" ""i hope i can have that one day,"" ""i can be okay""). There is a mention of death (""maybe i don't need to die""), but it is framed as a rejection or negation of the need to die, rather than an expression of intent. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no use of words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct statements such as ""I want to die""). The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" implies a past consideration of death but is not a direct expression of current suicidal desire. It is vague and negating, so it leans toward 'indicator' as per the rule for unclear cases.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The absence of any planning elements rules out 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future hopes. The phrase ""maybe i don't need to die"" suggests a general reflection but does not refer to past attempts or actions. No historical suicide attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains general distress and a vague reference to death (""die""), but it lacks explicit suicidal expressions (e.g., ""I want to end my life""). The tone is primarily hopeful, with the death mention being indirect and negated. Per the rules, vague feelings about dying without explicit suicide mention, or when in doubt, default to 'indicator'. This does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts) or higher categories.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly and links them to boredom.
   - Asks about lethality of taking 3 Xanax pills (""can you die from taking 3 xanax pills?"").
   - States intent to take Xanax regardless of advice (""i will do it anyway"").
   - Denies current desire to die (""i dont wanna die rn"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is an explicit expression of suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Mentions a specific substance (Xanax) and quantity (3 pills), but frames it as a query about risk (""can you die?"") rather than stating a plan. The primary intent expressed is to ""be calm,"" not to die. No explicit suicide plan or preparation described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current suicidal thoughts and immediate intent to use Xanax, not past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (""suicidal thoughts""), but the Xanax reference lacks specificity as a suicide plan (focuses on calming effects/risk curiosity). No method, preparation, or clear intent to die is stated. Rules dictate choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' when planning is uncertain.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of self-loathing (""i am a fucking monster,"" ""i am just a piece of human garbage"") and hopelessness. It explicitly mentions self-harm with the question, ""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing,"" and suicide with the phrase, ""i will wait until I can kill myself."" There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described for suicide (e.g., no mention of how, when, or with what means). No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""). There is a direct expression of wanting to die (""i will wait until I can kill myself""), which is conditional on another event (""if he is dead"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. The self-harm question relates to non-suicidal behavior (avoiding notice) and is not tied to a suicide plan. Without explicit planning details, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal intent (""i will wait until I can kill myself"") refers to a future possibility, not a past event. There is no description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but no specific plan or preparation for suicide. The self-harm inquiry is separate and not explicitly linked to suicidal intent. Following the rules, when there is no explicit plan, it falls under 'ideation'. The explicit mention of suicide rules out 'indicator', and the lack of planning or past attempts rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself""), expressions of a strong urge to die, feelings of hopelessness (""life is fucking stupid""), and despair about relationships (""people don't care""). There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. The focus is on current suicidal thoughts and a general future intent (""soon""), with no references to past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, preparations, or plans are mentioned. The phrase ""soon"" is vague and lacks concrete details.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses current feelings and future intentions, not past events or attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit suicide mention qualifies it beyond 'indicator'. The absence of a specific plan or method rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'. This fits 'ideation' as it expresses a desire to die without detailing a plan.

   - Mentions of death/dying: ""plummet to the ground,"" ""corpse.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""tempted,"" ""guilt,"" ""fear.""  
   - Specific method: ""go to the highest floor and plummet"" (location and action described).  
   - No references to past attempts or preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly named (e.g., ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but ""plummet to the ground"" to become a ""corpse"" explicitly expresses a desire to die. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method/location: ""highest floor"" (location) and ""plummet"" (method). → **Yes**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current temptation (""so tempted""), not past events. → **Current intent**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (supports *ideation* or *behavior*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific suicidal behavior: standing/sitting on a hospital parking garage ledge with intent to jump.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one notices""), despair (""someone looked at me and kept walking"").  
   - Explicit planning: Identifies a method (jumping) and location (hospital parking garage).  
   - Preparations: Recurrent visits to the ledge (""sometimes for an hour"").  
   - References a past suicide at the location but focuses on the user's current actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

   - Recurrent preparatory actions (visiting the ledge) indicate active engagement in suicidal planning.  
   - Fits **Behavior**: Explicit plan (jumping from a known location) and preparations (repeated visits to the site).

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online. Thanks for reading into my Ted talk, and sorry for my grammar, punctuation and everything else.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions multiple past suicide attempts (using phone charger, other unspecified attempts)
   - Explicit current suicidal thoughts: ""my death seems the ultimate answer""
   - Describes researching suicide methods: ""searching about ways to kill myself""
   - Strong emotional indicators (hopelessness, guilt, exhaustion)
   - References concrete past actions (arrest, academic failure)

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""tried committing suicide"", ""multiple attempts on my life"", ""ways to kill myself"")

   - Current research into methods but no specific new plan/preparation detailed

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Multiple past attempts explicitly stated
   - Current ideation present but no imminent plan described

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly described, triggering the ""attempt"" category per rules (""content describes past attempts"").

Im done being played with, im done trying my best but getting no results, done with everything.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions feelings of being ""more dead inside,"" which is metaphorical and indicates emotional numbness or despair, but not literal death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""nobody cares about me,"" ""im done with everything""), frustration, and a sense of futility (""done trying my best but getting no results"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note).
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"").
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive; phrases like ""done with everything"" suggest general exhaustion or giving up but are not explicit about suicidal intent. Since it's unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, substances) or preparations are described. The content focuses on emotional distress, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and frustrations, with no references to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses strong distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or references to past attempts. According to the category definitions, this falls under 'indicator' because there is no direct mention of suicide or desire to die, only general dissatisfaction and emotional pain.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions jumping off (method: falling from height), specifies location (bedroom window), and describes preparation (gathering courage). Expresses intent to act soon (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - Emotional indicators: Implied fear reduction (""less scary""), determination (""getting more courage"").
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly named, but ""jump off"" and ""do it"" contextually imply ending life. Direct expressions of intent to act (jumping) are present.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method (jumping from window) and location (bedroom) are stated. Environmental details (trees/mud reducing fear) indicate planning. Preparation involves building courage for imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""can do it soon""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Exceeds *indicator* (explicit intent/method). Exceeds *ideation* (specific plan/location/preparation). Not *attempt* (no past action). Matches *behavior*: explicit suicidal intent with concrete method (jumping from window) and preparation (gathering courage).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""depression hits really hard"" and ""writing suicide notes,"" which directly references suicide. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I feel like I'd just waste their time"") and despair, but no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or descriptions of past attempts. The suicide notes are a sign of preparation but not an explicit plan for action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""suicide notes,"" indicating direct expressions related to suicide.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, substances) are mentioned. ""Writing suicide notes"" is a preparation, but it is not tied to a concrete plan or timeline. Since the definition of ""behavior"" requires explicit planning (like methods or active preparations), and this is uncertain, it leans toward ""ideation"" based on the rule to choose ""ideation"" over ""behavior"" when unsure.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The writing of suicide notes is described as a recurring behavior during depressive episodes (""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes""), not as a past attempt or current actionable plan. There are no references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of ""suicide notes"" places it beyond ""indicator."" However, the lack of a specific method or clear plan (e.g., how or when to act) means it does not meet the threshold for ""behavior."" Writing suicide notes indicates suicidal thoughts without a detailed plan, fitting ""ideation."" It is not an ""attempt"" as no past actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""No one cares not even me""), despair (""fuck me fuck da world""), and explicit death wishes (""hope i die""). It includes self-deprecating thoughts and general dissatisfaction with life. No specific suicide methods, preparations, or plans are mentioned. There are no references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. The phrase ""hope i die"" is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: All references to death/dying (""hope i die"") reflect current/future intentions, not past actions. No mention of prior attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit wish to die (""hope i die"") confirms suicidal ideation. However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out ""behavior.""

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements are ""cut to deep"" which likely means ""cut too deep,"" indicating self-harm (specifically cutting), and ""fuck"" expressing frustration or distress. There is no explicit mention of death, dying, or suicide. Emotional indicators include distress but no clear hopelessness or despair about life. The phrase describes an action (""just cut"") that has occurred, implying a self-harming behavior, but it does not specify suicidal intent, plans, methods beyond the act itself, or references to past attempts. ""Cut too deep"" suggests an incident of self-injury that may have been accidental or unintended in severity.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (No). Since it is unclear if this relates to suicide, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (cutting) is mentioned, but it is not framed as part of a suicide plan (e.g., no indication it was intended to end life). There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools for future use). The post describes a past action, not a plan. If uncertain about planning, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here no suicidal thoughts are expressed, so 'behavior' does not apply.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - ""Just cut"" refers to a recent past event (the action has already happened). It does not describe a past suicide attempt, as there is no indication the cutting was intended to cause death; it could be non-suicidal self-injury.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes self-harm but lacks explicit suicidal content (e.g., no desire to die, no suicide plan). Self-harm alone, without expressed suicidal intent, falls under 'indicator' per the definition, which includes general distress without explicit suicide mentions. The rule to choose 'indicator' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned applies. It does not fit 'ideation' (no expressed desire to die), 'behavior' (no suicidal thoughts plus plan), or 'attempt' (no description of a past suicide attempt).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger and frustration towards others who offer generic advice like ""don't do it!"" or ""live for everyone else."" It criticizes their motives as self-serving and insincere. Key elements include:

   - Emotional indicators: Anger, resentment, and feeling misunderstood. No explicit hopelessness or despair about the author's own life.
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts.
   - Focus is entirely on condemning others' behavior, not describing personal suicidal thoughts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The frustration is directed at others, not inward.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicitly includes ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""thinking about partially planning to die.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (e.g., ""every single day I feel terrible,"" ""anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse,"" ""self-destructive"").
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. The phrase ""partially planning to die"" is vague and does not detail concrete steps, means, or preparations. The user also states, ""I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips,"" indicating a lack of defined plan.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post discusses current and ongoing thoughts, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicidal thoughts""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""want to justify dying""). Therefore, this goes beyond vague distress and meets the threshold for explicit mention.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or actions taken). The reference to ""partially planning to die"" is uncertain and lacks detail, falling short of explicit planning. Given the uncertainty, the rule dictates leaning toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current and ongoing thoughts (e.g., ""for the past few months,"" ""every single day""), with no mention of past suicide attempts. All references are to thoughts and feelings, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mentions of suicidal thoughts and desire to die rule out 'indicator'. The absence of specific plans, methods, or preparations means it does not qualify as 'behavior'. There are no descriptions of past actions, so 'attempt' is not applicable. The content aligns with 'ideation' because it expresses a persistent desire to die but without a concrete plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""no hope,"" ""tired of all of it"") and explicitly states ""I am still, so so so unbelievably suicidal"" and ""constantly dealing with suicidal thoughts.""
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions.
   - Focus is on persistent suicidal thoughts despite efforts to improve mental health.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: ""Unbelievably suicidal"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicit expressions of a desire to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No methods/preparations**: Only general struggles and thoughts are described, with no details about plans, means, or imminent actions.

   - Absence of specific plans/methods or references to past attempts rules out ""behavior"" and ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses feelings of depression, anxiety, and hopelessness (""I literally don't even have the motivation to get up anymore""). It discusses barriers to accessing therapy and fear of parental judgment. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit references to suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. The distress described is general and lacks suicidal intent.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No methods, tools, locations, or preparations related to self-harm/suicide are mentioned.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current emotional struggles and logistical concerns about therapy. No references to past or future suicidal actions.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post shows significant distress (depression, hopelessness), it lacks explicit suicidal expressions, plans, or references to past attempts. Falls under ""indicator"" per guidelines (general distress without suicidal ideation/behavior).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide method,"" indicating direct references to suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators include distress (e.g., ""i wish i wasn't like this"") and internal conflict about having these thoughts (e.g., ""i try to suppress my suicidal thoughts"").
   - A specific method (using eye drops for suicide) is mentioned, but it is framed as an ""idea"" inspired by a video, not a concrete plan or preparation. There is no mention of acquiring means, setting a time, or taking action.
   - No references to past attempts; all content relates to current thoughts and feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""suicide method.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (eye drops) is identified, but it is described as a new idea (""give me an idea of a new suicide method"") with no indication of intent to act, preparation, or explicit planning. The context is contemplative, not behavioral.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current suicidal ideation and reactions to recent content (e.g., ""i just saw a video""). There are no references to past attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a method, but the method is only presented as an idea without evidence of planning or imminent action. Per the definitions:
     - 'Behavior' requires explicit planning or preparations, which are absent here.
     - 'Attempt' is for past actions, which are not described.
     - 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.
     - 'Ideation' fits best, as it includes explicit desires to die with methods referenced but no specific plan or behavior. The rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about planning applies.

I felt do calm then when I decided how and when. I almost feel like I'm trying to coax the feeling back out so I can feel that rush of calm again. Hell maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions writing a suicide note, planning a suicide (""Planned everything out. Picked a time and place""), and deciding on a method (""how and when""). It describes preparations like having the note ""primed and ready to be posted."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm the common denominator in all of my problems"") and a desire for calm associated with suicidal planning. There is no description of a past attempt involving concrete action (e.g., self-harm), as the user ""sabotaged"" the plan. Current expressions include ""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time,"" indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts but without new specific plans mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide note"") and there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""free myself of my problems,"" ""do it this time"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific planning is mentioned: the user references a method (""how""), time, place, and preparations (writing and readying a suicide note). This is explicit planning, even though it occurred in the past and was not acted upon.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The planning and preparation are described as past events (""a month ago""). The current statement (""maybe I'll actually be able to do it this time"") suggests ongoing ideation but no new explicit plan. No past attempt occurred, as the user only planned and then ""sabotaged"" themselves.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and detailed past planning/preparation (suicide note, method, time, place), fitting the 'behavior' category. The current expression of intent (""do it this time"") lacks specific new plans, but the explicit past planning dominates. 'Attempt' does not apply, as no concrete action (e.g., self-harm) was taken. 'Ideation' is insufficient due to the explicit planning details.

215,"I am suffering and i dont feel it will ever end. I come from an abusive household where my parents dont love me or care about my feelings. I have tried to rekindle a relationship with my sister and it has gotten better but I still feel like utter hell. I am pretty sure I have some kind of PTSD from abuse and generalized anxiety in my body. I have been having health problems which my therapist thinks comes from my anxiety. I feel so alone and forgotten. I feel like I will never be loved that I am just a stain upon the world. I am crying as I write this because I just wish I wasnt alone in this world. I wish i had someone to be around and to grow old around not even in the romantic sense. Even if I lost them I would be grateful that i could trust that I loved someone and they loved me back. instead everyone just leaves when they see my weakness or they stay and try to exploit it so I have to leave them. Why am I so forsaken? I try to find peace in my faith which can help but before that just pain. Even when i sit still playing a game or reading a book all i can feel is tension and pain in my body. Nobody wants to listen to me without me having to pay them. I have a good therapist who listens and doesnt judge me but without paying her I would be alone. She tells me to be present but when i am present I feel like I am at the bottom of a rotten pit. I have felt like an outcast since my father  beat me and I fear I will always be an outcast.

As soon as I started to face my demons they have done their absolute best to consume me. i feel the world would not change at all if I were gone, I am already just a fading memory to everyone I have ever known. the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present even in all the endless pain.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains expressions of intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I dont feel it will ever end,"" ""I feel like utter hell,"" ""I feel so alone and forgotten""), worthlessness (""I am just a stain upon the world""), and isolation (""I feel like I will never be loved""). It references past abuse, current anxiety, and physical pain but does not mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm explicitly. Phrases like ""I feel the world would not change at all if I were gone"" imply a sense of insignificance but do not state a desire to die. There are no specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I were dead""). The phrase ""if I were gone"" is vague and indirect, leaning more toward hopelessness than explicit suicidal ideation. Given the uncertainty, this points to 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The absence of explicit planning rules out 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current emotional suffering and past abuse but does not describe any past suicide attempts or future intentions to act on suicidal thoughts. References are to ongoing struggles, not historical attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal content. Per the rules, general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without direct mention of suicide or death fall under 'indicator'. The phrase ""if I were gone"" is not explicit enough for 'ideation', and the doubt here favors 'indicator' as per guidelines. No elements align with 'behavior' or 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions ""want to die"" and describes two specific suicide methods: ""slit my wrist"" and ""hang myself"". It includes preparations (""get into my broken car"", ""hang myself from a tree for my parents to see"") and a timeframe (""Tuesday""). Expressions of hopelessness (""I'm done with life"") and self-blame (""all I cause is pain"") are present.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods (slitting wrists, hanging) and tools/locations (car, tree) are detailed, along with a clear timeline (""Tuesday""). This indicates planning and preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts"", ""it would be better if I was dead"", ""death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness about life's purpose (""Why do I struggle... if it won't lead to anything?""), emptiness after temporary joys.
   - Plans/methods: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - Past attempts: None mentioned. The robbery anecdote describes external danger, not self-harm.
   - Protective factors: Explicitly states reasons against acting (dog, loved ones, guilt).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Directly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and desire for death (""better if I was dead"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, preparations, or timelines mentioned. Only abstract desire for death (""eternal sleep"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes ""made me 10x more suicidal,"" which explicitly references suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses hopelessness (""It made me 10x more suicidal to be there"") and paranoia (""I'm paranoid after what happened last time"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of current plans, methods, or preparations for suicide. The focus is on seeking a hotline without intervention, not on acting on suicidal thoughts.
   - References to past attempts: The user describes a past experience with a hotline that led to involuntary hospitalization but explicitly states they ""didn't have a method or anything"" at that time. This is not a description of a past suicide attempt; it is a consequence of seeking help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""more suicidal,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal thoughts or feelings (Yes).
   - There is a direct expression of increased suicidal ideation due to past events, but no explicit current statement like ""I want to die right now.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present. The user is focused on avoiding intervention, not planning suicide.
   - Uncertainty about planning: Since there is no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post references a past event (involuntary hospitalization) and its ongoing emotional impact, but it does not describe a past suicide attempt. The phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal"" suggests current suicidal feelings resulting from past trauma, not a current or future plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of being ""suicidal"" rules out 'indicator' (which requires no explicit suicide references).
   - The absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'behavior'.
   - The lack of a described past suicide attempt rules out 'attempt' (the hospitalization was not an attempt; it was a response to seeking help).
   - The core content expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (""more suicidal"") without a plan, fitting 'ideation'. The help-seeking behavior (asking for a hotline) does not negate the presence of ideation.

There is no mention of specific suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts. The phrase ""I just want be by myself"" suggests isolation but lacks actionable plans.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""I dont want to live anymore"" directly expresses a desire to not be alive.

   - References to death/dying: ""until I die,"" ""why didn't he ask for help,"" and quoting others about ""ended it silently.""  
   - **No explicit mention** of the author's own suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts. The focus is on societal dismissal and the author's need for support.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No**. The author references others' statements about suicide (""ended it silently"") but never explicitly states *personal* suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). Phrases like ""hold on"" and ""need help"" suggest a struggle but not active suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None mentioned**. No descriptions of methods, tools, preparations, or locations related to the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotional pain and past experiences of neglect. **No references to past suicide attempts** by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and anger, but lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors by the author. Mentions of death are hypothetical (""until I die"") or critiques of others' attitudes.  
   - Strong expressions of dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicidal statements fall under **indicator** per the rules.

Im sad to say this might be my final good bye. ill miss my family they've always taken care of me but there's only so much to be done.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I feel like killing myself every day"" (direct expression of suicidal desire).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing here for me""), despair (""no more strength""), isolation.  
   - Specific preparations: ""suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done"" (explicit signs of planning).  
   - Past events: References prior posts/disappointments but no description of past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""killing myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Preparations include a suicide note and settling affairs (bills, testament), indicating concrete steps toward suicide. No specific method (e.g., tools/locations) is detailed, but preparations alone qualify under ""behavior"" (per rules: ""lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons [...] or preparations taken"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""this might be my final goodbye""). Past context describes emotional struggles, not attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire + concrete preparations (suicide note, testament) align with **Behavior** (expressions of suicidal thoughts **with** planning/preparation).  
   - No mention of past suicide attempts rules out ""Attempt"".  
   - Specific preparations elevate this beyond ""Ideation"" (which lacks plans).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kms"" (kill myself) used multiple times, ""I'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm not ok,"" ""I don't know what to do""), isolation, shame.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

223,"Family found out that I wanna kill myself and they tried to give me an intervention and failed embarrassingly. Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanna kill myself"", ""ruin their lives by killing myself"", ""wish I could shoot myself on the spot"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I shouldn’t have to stay alive for them""), anger (""They deserve to live... with the burden of my death"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: ""shoot myself"" (method) and reference to a ""suicide note"" (preparation).  
   - Past attempts: None described; the note is discarded evidence of intent, not a past act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct expressions like ""kill myself"" and ""shoot myself"" are unambiguous.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Shoot myself"" specifies a method (firearms).  
   - **Yes**: The discovered ""suicide note"" indicates concrete preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on *current* intent (""makes me wanna..."") and reactive urges (""shoot myself on the spot""). The note is discarded evidence but doesn’t describe a past *action* of attempting suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific method (""shoot myself"") + preparation (suicide note) = **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: Preparation (note) and method specification override ""ideation""; no past *action* rules out ""attempt"".

Nothing has happened that's making me want to do this. I've been thinking about suicide for a while now, had a few moderate days in between and now I'm back here.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""thinking about suicide"" and ""going to OD today"" (overdose), indicating suicidal intent. Specific medications are listed (venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolfresh, inderal), and the user describes a plan to take all of them at once. Emotional indicators include ""I can't feel anything right now"" and hopelessness. There is no reference to past attempts, only past thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while"").
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""thinking about suicide""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""going to OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" in the context of overdosing.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned: overdose using the listed medications. Preparations are indicated by possession of a ""month's prescription."" The user describes intent to act (""popping all of them at once"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""going to OD today""), not past events. No past attempts are described; only ongoing suicidal thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (ideation) and a specific plan with means (behavior). The method (overdose) and possession of medications align with the 'behavior' category. There is no description of a past attempt, so 'attempt' does not apply. Uncertainty about lethality (""probably not even lethal"") does not negate the explicit plan, so 'behavior' is appropriate over 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""nothing left,"" ""completely used up,"" apologies, gratitude, and ""the end is the only thing that feels right now.""
   - No explicit terms like ""suicide,"" ""die,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life.""
   - No references to methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations, or past attempts.
   - Emotional tone suggests hopelessness but lacks direct suicidal language.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is **not explicitly mentioned** (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will commit suicide"").  
   - ""The end"" implies finality but is vague and not a direct expression of wanting to die.  
   - *Leaning toward 'indicator'* due to ambiguity.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No methods, plans, or preparations** described (e.g., no weapons, notes, or timelines).  
   - Does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current despair (""feels right now""), with **no references to past attempts or actions**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Strong hopelessness and farewell themes align with distress, but **no explicit suicidal desire, plan, or attempt**.  
   - Falls under 'indicator' per rules: vague references to ""the end"" without explicit suicide intent, and uncertainty favors 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""I was already suicidal"" and ""all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat."" This indicates suicidal thoughts and a specific method of self-harm/suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of being ""so bad,"" ""terrible terrible,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed,"" and inability to cry, suggesting despair and hopelessness.
   - A specific method is identified: ""cutting my god damn throat,"" which is a direct reference to a lethal means.
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts; ""I was already suicidal"" refers to past ideation, not a concrete action.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools or writing notes) are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""suicidal"" is a direct term.
   - There is a direct expression of wanting to act: ""all I want to do is... cutting my god damn throat"" conveys a current desire to engage in life-threatening behavior.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""cutting my god damn throat"" describes a clear and lethal means (e.g., using a tool to cause fatal injury).
   - No explicit preparations are stated, but the method itself is detailed and actionable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I feel so bad"" and ""all I want to do"" are present tense). The phrase ""I was already suicidal"" refers to past ideation but does not describe a past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post moves beyond general distress (""indicator"") due to explicit suicidal expressions.
   - It includes a specific method (""cutting my god damn throat""), which aligns with the ""behavior"" category definition (mention of a plan or method, even briefly).
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, ruling out ""attempt.""
   - The presence of a method means it cannot be ""ideation,"" which requires no specific plan.
   - Rules clarification: Since a method is explicitly stated, ""behavior"" is chosen; there is no uncertainty here, so ""ideation"" is not favored.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post shares a quote about suicide (""if you want to kill yourself..."") and asks for its origin. The quote explicitly references suicide but is presented as a philosophical reflection. The user does not express personal emotions, plans, or experiences related to suicide; they merely inquire about the quote.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: The quote contains explicit suicide language (""kill yourself""), but this is **not** the user expressing their *own* desire to die. The user’s framing is neutral/inquisitive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No methods, preparations, or personal intentions are described. The quote is abstract and lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses a general quote, not past/current personal experiences. No references to attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The quote’s explicit mention of suicide does **not** equate to the user expressing ideation/behavior (rules specify classification applies only to the writer).  
   - The user shows no personal suicidal thoughts, plans, or history.  
   - General discussion of suicide without personal endorsement falls under **indicator** (per definition: lacks explicit expression *by the writer*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post includes phrases like ""i want to leave earth,"" ""end up wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog,"" and ""i can't do this anymore."" These express intense hopelessness and explicit desires to escape life/death. No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. References to past events (""since I was young"") are general struggles, not past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""kill myself"" or ""commit suicide""), but ""wanting to die"" and ""ready to join my dog"" (implying death) are direct expressions of a desire not to be alive → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (tools/substances), locations, or preparations described → **No**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes ongoing hopelessness and current desire to die (""now I'm ready""). No reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""wanting to die,"" ""ready to join my dog"") fits **ideation**.  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods rules out **behavior**.  
   - No description of past self-harm actions rules out **attempt**.

My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life.

I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses the user's past decision to ""kill myself before Christmas"" but explicitly states they now cannot do this due to their grandfather's recent death and concern for their mother's grief. Key elements include:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide (""kill myself"") and a timeframe (""before Christmas"").  
   - Emotional context (guilt, newfound appreciation for life).  
   - No specific methods, preparations, or tools described for suicide.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts; only past *intent*.  
   - Focus shifts to current perspective: ""his passing has saved my life,"" indicating discontinuation of the plan.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I was going to kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While a timeframe (""before Christmas"") is mentioned, there is no description of methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means). The reference to timing alone is insufficient for ""behavior.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **past intentions** (""had previously made up my mind,"" ""was going to"") that are explicitly canceled in the present (""Now, I know I can’t do that""). No description of a past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") confirms **ideation**, but absence of specific methods/preparations rules out ""behavior.""  
   - No past suicidal *action* (only intent), so not ""attempt.""  
   - Current discontinuation of the plan does not negate the past ideation but reinforces it as non-active.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""serious thoughts about suicide"", ""research for easy painless ways to kill myself"", ""actually want to commit suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (family conflicts, feeling unappreciated), despair (""adds to the fire"").
   - Methods/research: References researching suicide methods but no specific plan, timeline, or preparation described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Primarily describes recurring thoughts (e.g., ""for days"" in February, ""when we fight"") and current feelings. No past suicide attempts referenced.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicide"" explicitly and discusses death as preferable (""something better on the other side"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and idealizes a state without human suffering.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

   - **Yes**: Implies desire for an existence beyond life (""a life you live without thought or human Emotions"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific plans, methods, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on abstract concepts (normalizing suicide) and current feelings, not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (""suicide,"" longing for death-like state) but lacks actionable plans or methods. Rules out ""behavior"" (no plan) and ""attempt"" (no past action). ""Ideation"" fits best due to explicit desire to escape life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""death"" and describes it in a positive light (e.g., ""beautiful,"" ""to never feel pain anymore,"" ""to be nothing in a black sea of infinity""). However, there is no direct reference to suicide, self-harm, or killing oneself.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong themes of hopelessness, despair, and escapism are present (e.g., ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to let go after holding on so tight""), indicating distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post is philosophical and abstract, focusing on the concept of death rather than actionable steps.
   - References to past attempts: Absent. The post discusses current or hypothetical thoughts about death, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"").
   - There are no direct expressions of a personal desire to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, the post reflects on the abstract ""thought of death"" as beautiful and relieving.
   - Since it is unclear whether this constitutes a suicidal thought, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are described.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Uncertainty about planning does not apply, as there is no indication of intent; thus, 'ideation' is not triggered.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current or general thoughts about death, not past events or attempts. It is contemplative and forward-looking in a vague sense, but not tied to a specific time frame for action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and romanticization of death, but lacks explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or references to past attempts. Per the definitions:
     - **Indicator**: Fits because there is no explicit mention of suicide or personal desire to die, only vague feelings about death and escape from pain.
     - **Ideation**: Does not apply, as there is no explicit expression of wanting to end one's life (e.g., ""I don't want to be alive"").
     - **Behavior** or **Attempt**: Not relevant, as no plans, methods, or past actions are described.
   - Rules reinforcement: When in doubt about explicit suicide mentions, choose 'indicator'. The personal dissatisfaction here, while strong, does not cross into explicit suicidal territory.

   - Specific plans or methods: The user mentions a conditional plan based on COVID test results (""if i'm positive, i'll kill myself"") and states they will ""use any method,"" but this is vague and non-specific. No tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are detailed.
   - References to past attempts: The user refers to past suicidal thoughts (""i used to be afraid of death, the one thing that holds me back from committing suicide""), but no description of a concrete past attempt is present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""i'll kill myself""), and there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""as long as i don't see another day""). This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are described. The phrase ""use any method"" is generalized and lacks explicit details. The conditional nature (""if i'm positive"") also indicates intent rather than a concrete, actionable plan. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the rules dictate leaning toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The suicidal intent is future-oriented (dependent on COVID results) and includes references to past ideation, but no past attempts are described. The focus is on current/future intentions, not historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal desire (e.g., ""i'll kill myself""), qualifying it beyond 'indicator'. However, the lack of specific plans or methods means it does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'. With no mention of past attempts, 'attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation', as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide multiple times (""kill myself"", ""kill mslef"") and describes self-harm through a specific action: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (a sedative medication used in overdose attempts).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""failure,"" ""burden,"" ""disappoinment"") and despair (""I have nobody else"").
   - Specific method and preparation are indicated: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" shows a concrete action with a lethal means (overdose).
   - Reference to a past attempt is clear: ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone and nothing"" describes a prior suicide attempt that failed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""What shoul i do kill mslef"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned (zopiclone overdose), and there is evidence of preparation/action taken (""took an entire bottle"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The phrase ""took an entire bottle"" uses past tense, confirming a past suicide attempt. Current suicidal thoughts are also expressed (""What shoul i do kill mslef""), but the description of the past attempt is central.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (overdose on zopiclone) that failed, which aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition. Although current suicidal ideation is present, the rule specifies that if a past attempt is referenced, the category should be 'Attempt' regardless of current plans or thoughts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense distress, feelings of not belonging, and anger towards neurotypical individuals (""NTs"").
   - Explicitly states: ""I might kill myself.""
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""navigate through Hell"") and social alienation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""I might kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or timelines are mentioned.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The statement ""I might kill myself"" implies current/future intent (not past actions).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal intent (""kill myself"") qualifies for at least **ideation**.
   - Absence of methods/preparations rules out **behavior**.
   - No description of past actions rules out **attempt**.
   - **Indicator** is too low since suicide is explicitly mentioned.
   - The phrasing ""might"" suggests contemplation without concrete planning, fitting **ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""I'm going to end it"" and ""I will be non existent,"" indicating a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include struggling with long-term depression and a sense of finality (e.g., ""Goodbye world"").
   - Specific plans are detailed: taking ""a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another whole bottle of Advil"" as the method, with a timeline (""tonight"" and ""in about a few minutes"").
   - No references to past attempts or preparations beyond the described immediate action.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""end it"" and ""non existent,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned (overdosing on Tylenol and Advil), which qualifies as explicit planning under the 'behavior' definition.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes""), not past events.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it"") and includes a specific method (drug overdose), meeting the 'behavior' criteria. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable. The specificity of the plan rules out 'ideation', and the explicit suicide mentions rule out 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""i want to kill myself"" directly expresses a desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""physically uncomfortable,"" ""really miserable,"" frustration about memory gaps.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

   - No methods (tools/locations/substances), preparations, or timelines mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current distress (""makes me..."") and vague past misery. No description of past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die qualifies as **ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out ""behavior.""  
   - No past suicide actions described rules out ""attempt.""  
   - ""Indicator"" is inappropriate due to explicit suicidal intent.

And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"", ""end myself"", ""deserve to die"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life wants me to kill myself""), worthlessness (""not deserving of love"").
   - Specific plan: ""end myself on my birthday in two weeks"" (future timeline).
   - Past attempt: ""first failed attempt in October"".

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""kill myself"", ""end myself"", ""deserve to die"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific future date (""in two weeks"") but no explicit method/preparations described. Leans toward 'ideation' per uncertainty rule.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to past attempt (October) and current/future intent (birthday in two weeks).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire (ideation) with a timeline but no method/preparation details. Past attempt mentioned, but primary focus is future intent. Rules prioritize current state over past when both exist, and uncertainty about explicit planning defaults to 'ideation'.

Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""my last suicide attempt"" explicitly, referring to a past event.
   - It states that suicidal thoughts are gone (""My suicidal thoughts kinda left... they are gone""), and current thoughts about death are not actionable (""I think about death but not about doing it"").
   - Emotional indicators are positive (""I feel really good,"" ""it's a lot better,"" ""helped me almost completely""), showing recovery and reduced distress.
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations for current suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past depression and a past suicide attempt are clear, but no current intent or behavior is expressed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide attempt"" and ""suicidal thoughts""), but only in the context of the past. Current expressions lack explicit suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No current methods, plans, or preparations are described. The past attempt is not detailed, and current content has no planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on a past suicide attempt (one month ago) and past suicidal thoughts, with current content indicating absence of such thoughts and positive improvement.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt, which directly fits the ""Attempt"" category definition (""describes past attempts at suicide""). 
   - Although current suicidal thoughts are denied, and no current plans exist, the explicit reference to a past attempt overrides other categories per the rules. Current positive emotions do not change this classification, as ""Attempt"" is for historic actions.
   - It does not fit ""Behavior"" (no current plan), ""Ideation"" (no current suicidal thoughts), or ""Indicator"" (explicit suicide mention exists).

I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair (e.g., ""I can't take it anymore,"" ""I'm so tired,"" ""drowning in these awful thoughts"").
   - There is a mention of thoughts related to self-harm (""awful thoughts""), but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods.
   - The user explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" indicating no specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide.
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present; the only past action mentioned is going out of the house, which is unrelated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""kill myself"").
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive; the ""awful thoughts"" are vague and could imply distress without specifying suicidal intent.
   - Since it is unclear whether the thoughts are suicidal, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described; the user denies having a plan.
   - Uncertainty about explicit planning is not present, but the absence of any plan reinforces that this does not qualify for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings (e.g., ""I've been drowning,"" ""I'm so scared"") with no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions involving suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal expressions, plans, or past attempts. The phrase ""awful thoughts"" is ambiguous but not explicitly suicidal, and the denial of a plan further supports that this does not reach 'ideation'. According to the rules, general dissatisfaction and hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions should be classified as 'indicator'. When in doubt about explicit suicidal content, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense despair, self-loathing (""I fucking hate myself""), hopelessness (""I want to die""), and loss of interest in activities. Key elements include explicit statements about wanting to die (""I want to die""), persistent suicidal thoughts (""I think about dying every fucking day""), and intrusive violent ideation (imagining self-amputation/burning). No specific suicide methods, preparations, or timelines are mentioned. Self-harm thoughts are explicitly framed as hypothetical (""I've never purposely hurt myself""). Past hospitalization is noted but described as depression-related, not an attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day"" are direct expressions of a desire to die.  
   - **Yes**: Suicidal ideation is clearly and repeatedly stated.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific methods**: Mentions self-harm imagery (amputation/burning) but explicitly states no action was taken and emphasizes fear of pain.  
   - **No preparations**: No references to acquiring means, writing notes, or selecting locations.  
   - **No explicit plan**: Desires death passively (""Hopefully the roof collapses"") rather than planning active steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Current/future intentions**: Focuses on present/future suicidal thoughts (""I think about dying every day"").  
   - **Past events**: Hospitalization for depression is mentioned, but no description of past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (""want to die,"" ""think about dying every day""), meeting the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is described, ruling out **Behavior**.  
   - Violent fantasies are acknowledged as non-actionable due to pain aversion, reinforcing absence of behavioral intent.  
   - Past hospitalization lacks reference to attempts, ruling out **Attempt**.  
   - General distress alone would be **Indicator**, but explicit death wishes elevate it to **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional pain leading to physical symptoms (""hurt so bad emotionally that it starts to hurt physically,"" ""muscles ache"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness/exhaustion (""everything is so exhausting,"" ""my own body is giving up"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die (""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight"").  
   - No references to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" is absent).  
   - **Yes**, there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""hoping I will die in my sleep"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations described.  
   - ""Die in my sleep"" implies a passive wish, not an active plan or behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current despair and a future-oriented wish (""tonight""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit wish to die (""hoping I will die"") qualifies as suicidal ideation.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out ""behavior.""  
   - No description of past self-harm or attempts rules out ""attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly describes taking an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills, 300mg) with the stated intent that it ""wasn't enough to kill me,"" indicating a desire to die. There is a specific method mentioned (pills/overdose), and the action has been carried out. Emotional indicators include hopelessness implied by the suicide attempt. There is no reference to past attempts beyond this incident.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with the word ""suicide,"" but the act of overdosing to die is a direct expression of wanting not to be alive. This goes beyond vague feelings and shows explicit intent, so it is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (Zoloft overdose, 300mg) is mentioned, and preparations/actions are described (taking the pills at a specific time). However, since the action has already occurred, this is not just planning but an executed behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to a recent past event (""at 11:30 I took 6 pills"") and describes the aftermath (current symptoms and concern about hospital). It focuses on a concrete action that happened, not future intentions or vague thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content describes a concrete suicide attempt (overdose) that occurred in the past, as evidenced by the details of the action and the current physical effects. This fits the 'attempt' category, which is for past actions. It does not fit 'behavior' because 'behavior' is for current plans or preparations, not completed actions. The presence of a specific method and executed action rules out 'ideation' or 'indicator'.

At peace knowing it's soon. Hope my plan works though, there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes phrases like ""destined to do it,"" ""no way I'm living,"" and ""hope my plan works,"" which strongly imply suicidal intent, but suicide is not explicitly named (e.g., no direct use of words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""). Emotional indicators are present, such as hopelessness (""body that has clearly given up""), despair (""chronic stress,"" ""hellish trauma""), and a sense of calm/peace about the decision. There is a reference to a plan (""my plan""), but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. No references to past attempts are made; the focus is on current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no direct statements like ""I want to commit suicide""). However, there are direct expressions of not wanting to live (e.g., ""no way I'm living""). Since the explicit mention rule requires very clear wording, and ""no way I'm living"" constitutes an explicit desire to not be alive, this leans toward 'ideation'. But per the rule, if unclear about explicit mention, choose 'indicator'; here, the desire is explicit, so 'ideation' is more fitting.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A plan is hinted at (""my plan""), but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations are detailed. The statement ""Hope my plan works"" is vague and lacks explicit planning elements. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the rule states to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""destined to do it,"" ""it's soon""), with no mention of past suicide attempts. Thus, 'attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key elements show explicit expressions of not wanting to live (e.g., ""no way I'm living""), which meets the 'ideation' definition of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The vague reference to a ""plan"" lacks the explicit details required for 'behavior'. No explicit suicide mention (e.g., the word ""suicide"") creates some doubt, but the desire to not be alive is explicit, so 'ideation' is appropriate. The 'indicator' category is too low because there are explicit suicidal feelings, and 'behavior' or 'attempt' are not supported due to lack of specifics or past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions extreme hopelessness (""Hopeless"", ""realizing you're hopeless is too much"") and prolonged distress.  
   - Explicitly references seeking a ""suicide forum"".  
   - No direct statements about wanting to die, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""Suicide forum"" explicitly references suicide, but the post does **not** express a personal desire to die or commit suicide (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current hopelessness and a desire to find a forum; no past attempts mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - While ""suicide forum"" is an explicit reference to suicide, the post lacks expressions of personal suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want to live""). Seeking a forum suggests interest but not active ideation.  
   - Per rules: ""When in doubt whether suicide was explicitly mentioned or not, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'"".

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair (""disgusting to look at,"" ""how low my expectations,"" ""idc just want an end"").

   - Preparations/past attempts: No signs of preparation or past attempts described; focuses on current intent (""on the verge of trying"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""die"" and ""want an end"" directly express a desire to not be alive. Suicide is contextually explicit via ""slash my wrists.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method mentioned: ""slash my wrists"" clearly identifies a suicide method (tools/means).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone. ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""my life is not able to be fixed""), despair (""life will get better... is the most bullshit phrase""), and a direct desire for death (""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone""). It also mentions preparatory actions related to death (""ill fix all of the funeral costs"").
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""I cannot wait to die"" is a clear reference to dying, but ""suicide"" is not explicitly stated. However, the context links death to relief from pain, implying suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and rejection of reassurance are present.
   - Specific plans or methods: No mention of suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or immediate preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). ""Fixing funeral costs"" is a preparatory action for after death but does not specify a plan for committing suicide.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post focuses on current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no use of words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""). However, ""I cannot wait to die"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die, which aligns with suicidal ideation per the category definitions. Since the desire to die is clear, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide methods or plans are described (e.g., no tools, locations, or timelines). ""Fixing funeral costs"" indicates preparation for death but is not a direct plan for the act of suicide. It is an indirect sign but does not meet the threshold for explicit planning required for 'behavior'. Since there is uncertainty, 'ideation' is chosen over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I cannot wait to die,"" ""ill fix funeral costs""), not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression ""I cannot wait to die"" indicates suicidal thoughts, placing it beyond 'indicator'. However, the absence of a specific suicide plan or method means it does not qualify as 'behavior'. The mention of funeral costs is preparatory but not sufficient for 'behavior' as it lacks explicit planning for suicide. With no past attempts, 'attempt' is not applicable. Thus, the best fit is 'ideation', defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

(Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""i'm destined to live a depressed life,"" ""i can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past"") and distress about lost happiness. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""what's really the point?"" questions life's purpose but is not an explicit desire to end life). Due to this lack of explicitness, we lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are mentioned. This step is not applicable as there are no suicidal thoughts to evaluate.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on past happiness and current/future despair, with no references to past suicide attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows general distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. According to the rules, expressions of dissatisfaction or hopelessness without explicit suicide mentions fall under 'indicator'. Doubts about explicitness also favor 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

249,I doubt anyone will answer me but it's worth the shot. I live in NYC and I'm just here to find out what's the best bet if I where to jump from a bridge which one do I have the highest chance of death but even if no one answers I'm gonna pick one by the weekend so wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions jumping from a bridge to achieve death (""highest chance of death""), which is a method of suicide. It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") and a specific plan to choose a bridge by the weekend. There are no references to past attempts; the focus is on future action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but the intent to die by jumping from a bridge is clear and direct. The phrase ""highest chance of death"" and the context express a strong desire not to be alive. This goes beyond vague feelings, so it is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (jumping from a bridge) is mentioned, and the user is actively researching which bridge in NYC has the highest lethality. Preparations are indicated by the timeline (""pick one by the weekend""), showing intent to act imminently. This constitutes explicit planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (e.g., acting by the weekend) with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and specific planning (method and timeline), fitting the 'behavior' category. It does not describe a past attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable. The presence of a plan rules out 'ideation', and the explicitness of suicidal intent rules out 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""treat me like shit,"" ""suffer,"" ""live in pain,"" ""pain will never loosen its grip,"" ""destiny.""

   - **No explicit mentions of suicide, death, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No direct expressions** of wanting to die, not be alive, or commit suicide. Phrases like ""I will never die"" emphasize perceived eternal suffering, not a desire for death.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions sister's suicide and past attempts (irrelevant per rules).  
   - Explicitly references personal ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago.""  
   - Expresses ambivalence about living (""why bother going through all of it?""), weariness (""look forward to sleep""), and passive acceptance of death (""state lasting forever is hard to turn away from"").  
   - **No specific plans, methods, or preparations** for current suicide. Protective factor mentioned (parents' feelings).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: ""aborted attempt at suicide"" (past).  
   - Current expressions are passive (e.g., eternal sleep as relief) but **not explicit desire to die now**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current methods, tools, locations, or preparations** described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past attempt** explicitly detailed (""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"").  
   - Current feelings are abstract (questioning purpose, weariness) without actionable intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempt (""aborted attempt"") directly aligns with **Attempt** definition (historic action).  
   - Current content lacks explicit planning/behavior, ruling out ""behavior."" Passive thoughts without explicit desire to die now support ""attempt"" over ""ideation"" (per category rules: past attempts dominate classification).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness and despair: ""There's not hope anymore,"" ""no joy,"" ""no emotion,"" and ""the pain is numb.""
   - Explicit mention of suicidal intent: ""I plan on doing it"" implies suicide, as it's followed by an apology to loved ones and reasoning (""it's for the best"").
   - Specific method and location: ""in the tub"" is mentioned, with consideration for reducing mess, indicating planning.
   - No references to past attempts; the focus is on current/future intentions.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of worthlessness and numbness due to life disappointments.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""I plan on doing it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, especially in context. Direct expressions of intent to die are present (e.g., ""it's for the best"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method/location is mentioned (""in the tub""), showing explicit planning to minimize mess. This goes beyond general thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current/future intentions (""I plan on doing it""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific plan (""in the tub"") aligns with the ""behavior"" category. It is not ""indicator"" due to explicit suicide references, not ""ideation"" because a plan is specified, and not ""attempt"" as no past actions are described.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal intent, including ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT"" and ""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it."" It details extensive emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness, trauma, abandonment) and references self-harm behaviors: secret misuse of prescribed painkillers/antidepressants, paracetamol addiction causing liver damage, self-starvation, and a stated lack of success (""I didn't succeed""). No specific future suicide method or plan (e.g., tools, location) is mentioned, but active self-destructive behaviors are documented.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""End it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide, reinforced by ""wanting to end it"" and contextual despair. The phrase ""commit suicide"" isn't used, but the intent is unambiguous.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No explicit future plan (e.g., ""I will use X method""). However, the post describes **ongoing self-harm behaviors** (drug misuse, starvation) tied to suicidal intent. These are past/current actions, not future plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to current suicidal thoughts (""going to end it"") and documents **past/ongoing self-harm** (addiction, bodily damage). Mentions a prior attempt (""I didn't succeed""), but the focus is on persistent harmful behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""end it"") rules out *indicator*.  
   - Ongoing self-harm (substance abuse, starvation causing organ damage) and reference to a past attempt (""I didn't succeed"") indicate active harmful **behaviors**, not just thoughts.  
   - No specific *future* plan places it below *attempt*, but the documented behaviors align with **behavior** (self-harm with suicidal intent).  
   - *Attempt* isn't the best fit, as the post emphasizes current behaviors/thoughts over solely past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicit phrases include ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and ""let a train crush my head.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair and hopelessness are present (e.g., ""I have no one,"" ""Fuck my life,"" ""Fuck everything"").
   - Specific plans/methods: The user describes a specific method (""lay my head on the train tracks"") and location (""train station near my house"").
   - Preparations: No explicit signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), only ideation about actions.
   - References to past attempts: Mentions past suicidal thoughts (""I was finally getting over suicidal thoughts"") and self-harm urges (""I feel like cutting myself again""), but no description of a concrete past suicide attempt (e.g., overdose or action taken).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""let a train crush my head"").
   - Leaning toward 'ideation' or higher due to explicitness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes (train tracks as a means, train station as a location).
   - Signs of preparation: None described (only ""thinking about"" it).
   - Since a specific method and location are mentioned, this indicates a plan. However, the phrasing ""I'm thinking about"" suggests contemplation rather than imminent action. But per the definition, mentioning specific methods/locations qualifies as a plan, so 'behavior' applies unless uncertain.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Refers to past events: Past suicidal thoughts and self-harm urges are mentioned, but no past suicide attempts are described.
   - Current/future intentions: Current suicidal ideation and a specific plan (""thinking about running away..."") are expressed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I really want to fucking kill myself""), so it is not 'indicator'.
   - It mentions a specific plan with method (train tracks) and location (train station), which aligns with the 'behavior' definition: ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide"" with ""specific methods"" or ""suitable locations.""
   - There is no description of a past suicide attempt, only past thoughts and self-harm, so 'attempt' does not apply.
   - Although the plan is phrased as ""thinking about,"" the specificity of the method and location means it is not vague ideation. Per rules, if specific methods are mentioned, it should be 'behavior', and uncertainty would favor 'ideation', but here the plan is explicit enough for 'behavior'.
   - Final category: 'behavior' due to explicit suicidal thoughts combined with a specific plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly described, meeting the **Attempt** definition (""content describes past attempts at suicide"").  
   - While current ideation is present, the rules specify: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, there is no explicit *current plan*, only desire and past actions.

All I want is courage to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""It's over.""  
   - Explicit expression of suicidal intent: ""All I want is courage to end it.""  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - ""End it"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, directly expressing a desire to die. → **Yes**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No tools, locations, substances, or preparations mentioned. → **No plan**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings (""All I want...""), no past actions described. → **Current intentions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it"") but no plan or method → Fits **Ideation**.  
   - Not vague dissatisfaction (explicit wish to die) but no actionable steps → Not ""Behavior.""  
   - No past suicide attempts described → Not ""Attempt.""

259,"April 13, 2021. On that day, at 13:14 hours. I'm going out. I was born at that time 18 years ago and I'm going out of this world at that time. I'm not worth living and I'm offing myself then. Goodbye world.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""I'm offing myself"" and ""I'm going out of this world,"" indicating a direct desire to die. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm not worth living""). A specific plan is implied with the date and time (April 13, 2021, at 13:14 hours), but no details about methods, tools, locations, or preparations are provided. There are no references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""I'm offing myself""). Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (""I'm going out of this world,"" ""I'm not worth living"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are described. The mention of a specific time indicates intent but does not constitute a detailed plan or preparation as defined for 'behavior'. Since the method is vague (""offing myself""), and no explicit planning elements are present, this leans toward 'ideation' based on the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to a future intention (""I'm going out of this world at that time""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, placing it beyond 'indicator'. However, the lack of specific method details means it does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'. The specific time alone, without method or preparation, is insufficient for 'behavior' under the rules. With no past actions described, 'attempt' does not apply. Thus, 'ideation' is the best fit, as it captures explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness and despair about romantic rejection and societal issues. Key elements include:
   - Explicit statements: ""I want to kill myself so bad,"" ""I don't want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefully.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""I hate this world,"" ""I'm so fucking done,"" ""It will never be better,"" ""I can't take it anymore.""
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct expressions include: ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and ""I just want to die peacefully.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plans or methods**. Mentions of getting drunk are contextualized as coping (""All I can do is get drunk""), not as a suicide plan. No details about means, timing, or preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current/future intentions** (""I want to kill myself,"" ""It will never be better""). No references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die/kill oneself, meeting the threshold for **ideation**. However, it lacks any specific plans, methods, or preparations (e.g., no mention of tools, notes, or locations), ruling out **behavior**. No past actions are described, ruling out **attempt**. General distress alone would be **indicator**, but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to **ideation**.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""I just can't do this anymore""), despair (""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause""), and a sense of being a burden (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me""). 
   - It includes a desire to end suffering (""I have to make it stop"") but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. 
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, or actions) are described. 
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""kill myself""). 
   - The statement ""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me"" implies passive thoughts of absence but is not a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. 
   - Since it is unclear, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
   - Without explicit planning, this cannot be classified as 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and a general desire to end pain, with no references to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains strong emotional distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal expressions, plans, or references to attempts. 
   - According to the definitions, 'indicator' applies when there is no explicit mention of suicide, even with general dissatisfaction or hopelessness. 
   - The rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' in cases of doubt supports this classification.

I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I don't belong here,"" ""nothing is better than this""), self-loathing (""I hate myself""), and perceived burdensomeness (""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but their lives would be better""). Crucially, it includes:  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I would have done it already...""  
   - Fear of failed suicide attempt (""botching it"")  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described  
   - No references to past suicide attempts  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""I would have done it already"" directly implies suicidal intent (where ""it"" = suicide), confirming active desire to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. The fear of ""botching it"" implies consideration of methods but lacks concrete details (e.g., no tools, substances, locations).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to current suicidal thoughts (""I would have done it already..."") with no description of past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire confirms this exceeds *indicator* (general distress).  
   - Absence of methods/preparations rules out *behavior*.  
   - No description of past suicide actions rules out *attempt*.  
   - The expression of active suicidal intent without plans aligns with *ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""not wanting to live,"" ""comfortable with leaving this life,"" ""I would say I'm suicidal.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""glass being empty,"" ""no success,"" ""failure,"" ""waste of space,"" ""suffer""), despair (""can't get my life together,"" ""no motivation"").  
   - Plans/methods: Explicitly states ""I don't have the balls to actually do it"" and plans to wait until his son is an adult (future intent without specifics). No methods, tools, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Past attempts: None described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm suicidal"" and ""not wanting to live.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, locations, or preparations. Future intent (""wait till he's an adult"") lacks actionable details. Uncertainty resolved per rules: Leans toward ""ideation"" due to absence of explicit planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future suicidal thoughts, not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""I'm suicidal"") without plans/preparations fits **Ideation**. The future intent is vague (no method), and self-assessment (""don't have the balls to do it"") confirms absence of imminent behavior. Hopelessness supports ideation but isn't standalone.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""depressed and feeling like shit for years,"" ""struggling to hold on,"" and ""just want off this life."" There are expressions of hopelessness and a desire to escape life, but no explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past attempts.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is **not explicitly mentioned** (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"").  
   - ""Want off this life"" implies a desire to escape existence but **lacks direct phrasing** like ""I want to die.""  
   - *Conclusion*: Leans toward 'indicator' due to ambiguity.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific methods** (e.g., tools, locations) or **preparations** described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/persistent feelings (""years & years""), **no past attempts** referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong hopelessness and desire to escape life are present, but **no explicit suicidal intent, plan, or behavior**.  
   - Falls under 'indicator' per rules: vague dissatisfaction without explicit suicide mention, and ambiguity defaults to 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself"" and expresses hopelessness (""life just isn't worth it""), loss of interest (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), and distress about impacts on others. There are no references to specific methods, preparations, locations, or past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Kill myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal intent and desire to die.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The question about minimizing harm implies consideration of consequences but does not constitute a plan.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses current suicidal thoughts and future concerns, with no reference to past attempts.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""I'll be gone"" (which could imply death but is vague), expresses hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around,"" ""no point in trying,"" ""can't escape""), and references depression and fatigue. There are no explicit mentions of suicide, death, or self-harm terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die."" No specific methods, plans, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are described. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive are absent; ""I'll be gone"" is indirect and could be interpreted as leaving or disappearing without specifying death. Since it is unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are identified (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions). The future reference ""by this time next week"" suggests intent but lacks concrete details. With no explicit plan, this does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""I'll be gone"") and current distress, not past events. There is no description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and despair, which are general indicators of distress. However, it lacks explicit suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""suicide"") or any reference to plans, methods, or past attempts. Following the rules—especially ""when in doubt whether suicide was explicitly mentioned, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'""—the best fit is 'indicator'. The hopelessness described falls under ""very large general dissatisfaction about life"" without explicit suicide mention.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""die,"" ""survive another attempt,"" and ""I just want to die,"" indicating explicit references to death and a past suicide attempt.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair, such as not wanting to hear from parents again and expressing a desire to die.
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions).
   - There is a clear reference to a past attempt with ""another attempt,"" implying a concrete historical action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but ""die"" and ""attempt"" (in context) are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. Leaning toward 'ideation' or 'attempt' due to explicitness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is on the aftermath of a past attempt and a current desire to die, without details on how a future attempt might occur. Uncertain about planning, so lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to a past event (""another attempt"") and expresses current suicidal desires (""I just want to die""). Past attempts are specifically described through ""survive another attempt,"" confirming a historical action. No current plans are indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""), which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition (focused on historic actions). Although current suicidal ideation is present (""I just want to die""), the explicit reference to a past attempt takes precedence. The 'attempt' category also applies when past attempts are mentioned, even with current ideation, as per the rule: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, no current plans are mentioned, but the past attempt is central. 'Behavior' is not applicable due to lack of planning, and 'ideation' is overruled by the historical action description.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""vaguely suicidal stuff"" and two specific past events involving self-harm methods.  
   - Explicitly describes the second event: ""I went in with the intention of dying"" and used a method until near the ""point of no return.""  
   - Refers to past actions (""both happened long enough ago"") and current emotional reflection, but no current plans or preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""suicidal stuff,"" ""intention of dying,"" and testing a method explicitly reference suicide.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are implied (e.g., ""testing my method,"" ""point of no return"") but not detailed. Actions are past-focused, not active planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details **past suicide attempts** (testing a method with intent to die and stopping at the brink). This fits the ""Attempt"" category, which captures historical actions regardless of outcome. No current ideation/behavior is indicated.

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer.

But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family?

   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""contemplating suicide"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are named (car, stabbing).
   - Mentions ""looking up how to do it,"" indicating research/preliminary planning.
   - No evidence of immediate preparation (e.g., notes, acquired means), but methods are concrete.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Describes current suicidal urges during school hours (""6 hours of contemplating suicide"").
   - No reference to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts and specific methods (car/stabbing) move this beyond vague ideation.
   - ""Looking up how to do it"" supports planning, aligning with **Behavior** (explicit plan/method).
   - Rules: When methods are specified, choose **Behavior** over Ideation. No past attempts, so not Attempt.

You can't trust anyone because no matter what they say you know deep down at some point they're going to leave you.

If we all died at the same time no one would feel the pain of losing anyone and we could all Rest In Peace.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong emotions of hopelessness, despair, and dissatisfaction with life (e.g., ""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""I'm so fucking done with this shit,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I hate this so much"").
   - There is a desire to escape or not exist (e.g., ""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want to leave and never come back"").
   - There is a wish for collective death (e.g., ""I wish a nuclear bomb would just kill us all""), but no explicit mention of personal suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or specific plans/preparations for suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"").
   - While phrases like ""I don't want to be here anymore"" and ""I want out"" imply a desire to not be alive, they are not direct expressions of wanting to die by suicide. The wish for a nuclear bomb is external and collective, not personal. Since it's unclear, lean toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content is focused on emotional distress, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses past relationship issues but no past suicide attempts. The expressions of despair are current, but there is no indication of future intent to act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains general distress and hopelessness, with vague desires to escape life or for death, but no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. According to the rules, ""indicator"" applies when there is no explicit mention of suicide, and in cases of doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. The wish for collective death does not constitute personal suicidal ideation.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to die"" and ""pull the trigger"" (referencing suicide by firearm).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""so much pressure from my skin color"").
   - Specific methods: ""pull the trigger"" indicates a firearm as a suicide method. No explicit preparations or past attempts are described.
   - Temporal context: Refers to current/future intentions (""I’m just going to pull the trigger"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.
   - Yes: ""pull the trigger"" explicitly implies suicide.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes: ""pull the trigger"" specifies a method (firearm). This qualifies as an explicit plan under the ""behavior"" definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on future intent (""I’m just going to...""), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal desire (""I want to die"") and a specific method (""pull the trigger""). This meets the ""behavior"" criteria (explicit plan/method mentioned). The reference to police violence is contextual but does not alter the subject’s stated plan. No past attempts are described, ruling out ""attempt."" The specificity of the method prevents classification as ""ideation"" or ""indicator.""

And at work my forearms with my wounds are visible for everyone to notice but they just say thinks like work faster, go to bed earlier( sleeping is really hard and I'm tired all the time). I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness. Death seems like the only place where I can be free.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago""), emotional distress (e.g., ""No one cares for my Problems,"" ""I'm tired of putting a mask on for others happiness,"" and ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free""). There is no explicit mention of suicide, specific methods, plans, preparations, or references to past suicide attempts. The self-harm is described but not framed as a suicide attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life""). The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" implies a desire for escape but is vague and indirect about dying; it does not directly express a wish to die or not be alive. Per rules, if unclear, lean toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The self-harm reference is past and non-specific, not indicating current planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The self-harm (""hurt myself two months ago"") refers to a past event, but it is not described as a suicide attempt—only as self-injury. The emotional content (e.g., tiredness, hopelessness, and the death reference) appears current but lacks explicit suicidal intent or future plans.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness, but no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or past suicide attempts. The death reference is vague and falls under the 'indicator' definition (general dissatisfaction with life and vague feelings about death without explicit suicide mention). Past self-harm does not qualify as 'attempt' without suicidal intent, and there is no current 'behavior'. Doubt about explicit suicide mention defaults to 'indicator'.

I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get. I write detailed plans in my journal and almost every day have long conversations with myself about suicide in that journal. I think about suicide every day, but actually seriously consider it only once a week or so. But I know I would never do it- I'm really worried I would go to hell if I did. I really want to get help and to get better and at least tell someone about all of this. But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense loneliness, hopelessness, and ongoing sadness. Key elements include:
   - Explicit statements: ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""I think about suicide every day.""
   - Mentions writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal and daily internal conversations about suicide.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, or notes).
   - References persistent suicidal thoughts for seven years but no indication of past attempts.
   - Expresses fear of hospitalization and desire to get help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Direct phrases include ""suicidal,"" ""suicide,"" and ""think about suicide every day.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - ""Detailed plans"" are mentioned but lack specificity about methods/preparations. No tools, locations, or actions are described.
   - Uncertainty exists about whether ""plans"" imply actionable steps. Following rules: when unsure, default to 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current/persistent thoughts (""every day,"" ""once a week"").
   - No past attempts described (only enduring ideation for seven years).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire (ideation) is present.
   - No evidence of specific plans, methods, or preparations (rules: vague ""plans"" without details → ideation).
   - No past attempts or imminent actions described.
   - Fear of consequences (hell, hospitalization) reinforces lack of intent to act.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes a frowning emoticon "":("" indicating sadness or distress. Phrases like ""I cant take it anymore"" and ""The pain is unreal"" convey intense emotional suffering and hopelessness, but there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (No). The language reflects general despair without suicidal intent, so it leans toward 'indicator' due to lack of explicitness.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are identified. This rules out 'behavior'.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional state with no references to past events or attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or past actions. According to the rules, general dissatisfaction without explicit suicide mention falls under 'indicator', and any doubt favors 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide,"" which is a direct reference to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include a sense of capability or empowerment related to suicide in a sober state, but no explicit hopelessness or despair is expressed.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - There are no references to past attempts; the focus is on current capability.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**  
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commiting suicide"").  
   - There is a direct expression related to suicide (""capable of commiting suicide""), but it does not state a current desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). It focuses on ability rather than intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations are described. The word ""sober"" refers to a state of mind but not a suicide method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**  
   - The post discusses a current capability (""I think I'm capable"") with no reference to past events or future intentions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post contains an explicit mention of suicide, ruling out 'indicator'.  
   - There is no description of a specific plan, method, or preparation, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.  
   - No past attempt is described, so it is not 'attempt'.  
   - The expression ""capable of commiting suicide"" reflects suicidal thoughts or feelings (ideation) without a plan, fitting the 'ideation' category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of emotional distress (e.g., ""I'm a piece of shit,"" ""I hate every part of my life""), hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""I just want it to be over""), and a desire for relief (e.g., ""I'm sick and tired and I want to be done""). There is mention of being drunk, but no references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die""). The phrase ""I just want it to be over"" is vague and could imply a wish to end suffering rather than life itself. There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. Due to the lack of explicitness, this leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances for suicide) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. Being drunk is a current state but not presented as part of a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings (e.g., ""I don't want to be alone anymore,"" ""I hate every part of my life"") with no references to past attempts or future intentions involving suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains strong expressions of distress, self-loathing, and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. According to the rules, vague feelings like ""I just want it to be over"" without explicit suicidal intent fall under 'indicator'. Since there is no desire to die expressed directly, and no plan or past attempt, 'indicator' is the best fit. When in doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

   - Explicit mention of past suicide attempts (""attempted suicide 11 times"").  
   - Describes future intent to use suicide for disturbance (""I will use my suicide...""), but **no specific method, plan, or preparation** (e.g., tools, locations, notes).  
   - Strong emotional language (e.g., ""hate capitalism"") but no explicit hopelessness/despair tied to **current** suicidal planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""attempted suicide,"" ""use my suicide.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - **Past attempts explicitly stated** (""attempted suicide 11 times"").  
   - Future intent is vague (no actionable plan).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

   - Specific plans/methods: Detailed evaluation of firearms (caliber, placement in mouth) and overdose risks, including fear of failed attempts.  
   - Preparations: No explicit signs of active preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), but thorough research of methods.  
   - Past attempts: None described (only references to Mark Linkous's overdose as an example).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct expressions include ""accomplish death,"" ""End it now,"" and critiques of ""don’t kill yourself"" responses.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes the phrase ""wanna sleep and never ever wake up,"" which implies a desire for death, but it does not explicitly mention suicide, dying, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions like ""Can't do any of it"" and ""don't want this anymore"" indicate hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: None present; the post focuses on current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no use of words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life"").
   - There are direct expressions of not wanting to be alive (""never ever wake up""), but this is metaphorical and not explicit about suicide. Given the doubt, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""just don't want this anymore""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses hopelessness and a desire to not be alive through the metaphor of sleeping forever, but it lacks explicit suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die by suicide""). According to the 'indicator' definition, vague feelings about death without explicit suicide mentions fall under this category. The rules specify that when in doubt about explicitness, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There is no plan or behavior described, ruling out 'behavior' and 'attempt'.

   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times (e.g., ""I can't stop thinking about suicide,"" ""end it,"" ""attempt""). It also includes phrases like ""suffer till I end it,"" which directly relate to ending life.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I feel so hopeless, I will never be ok""), despair (""I am really suffering emotionally""), and distress (""I cry about it"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The user states ""I have a plan"" and provides details: ""I know where I'll attempt, I know how, I know what I need, I know how and when I can run away from home."" Specific timing is mentioned (""It must be a Tuesday""), indicating concrete planning.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts; all references are to current or future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""thinking about suicide""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""end it."" This is clear and unambiguous, so it leans beyond 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are implied (""I know how"") and preparations are detailed, including location (""where I'll attempt""), resources (""what I need""), and timing (""Tuesday to run away"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (e.g., ""I have a plan,"" ""I will just suffer till I end it""). There are no references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I can't stop thinking about suicide""), which rules out 'indicator'. 
   - It includes a specific plan (location, method, preparations, and timing), which exceeds the definition of 'ideation' (thoughts without a plan). 
   - The details align with the 'behavior' category (explicit expressions plus a plan). 
   - No past actions are described, so 'attempt' does not apply. 
   - There is no uncertainty about the plan being explicit, so 'behavior' is appropriate.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;. I've spent about three hours trying to think through everything going on in my life right now and I just can't see a solution or a way out? I want to be done, I want to be out of this and I wish I could just sleep for now but I can't. I want to disappear. I do not want to exist anymore. Sorry for the total drivel, I'm so angry/down right now and I needed to vent.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains multiple expressions of distress and suicidal thoughts. Key phrases include ""make me want to die,"" ""I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now,"" ""I almost hope something bad happens to me,"" ""spending time here makes me want to not exist,"" ""I want to be done,"" and ""I do not want to exist anymore."" There are also references to emotional abuse, isolation (""I have no one else""), and hopelessness (""I just can't see a solution or a way out""). No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""commit suicide"").  
   - However, there are **direct expressions of wanting to die or not exist** (e.g., ""want to die,"" ""not exist anymore""). This qualifies as explicit ideation.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. Mentions of ""wandering off into the night"" are vague and lack concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - All expressions refer to **current feelings** (e.g., ""right now,"" ""at this moment""). No references to past attempts or actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses a **strong, explicit desire to die or cease existing** (""want to die,"" ""not exist anymore""), meeting the threshold for *ideation*.  
   - Absence of plans/methods rules out *behavior*; lack of past suicide actions rules out *attempt*. General distress alone would be *indicator*, but explicit death wishes elevate it to *ideation*.

286,"I'm so tired of everything. Things have been so tough. The only thing I find comfort in these days is ideations of suicide. I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive. My family is concerned, especially my mom. All I do is confine myself to my room. I hardly have an appetite these days, my sleep schedule has been fucked and I haven't gone to the gym in two weeks. Leaving bed is a challenge. I'm a Black trans man and I have a therapist who is really great and also a person of color, but I often wonder if I'm even able to be helped. Though I confide in her about my issues, I don't tell her about my ideations because 1. I'm embarrassed to admit this and 2. I'm afraid that since she's a therapist she'd have to report it. Having police come to my house would only make everything worse for me. Most days I wish I wasn't alive. Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it. I try to imagine a future for myself but I just can't. Trying to love and forgive myself feels so impossible.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""ideations of suicide,"" ""most days I wish I wasn't alive,"" and ""Life is too painful and nothing seems to be worth it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I try to imagine a future... but I just can't""), despair, shame, isolation, and self-loathing.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts; all descriptions are current thoughts or feelings.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Suicide is explicitly referenced (""ideations of suicide,"" ""wish I wasn't alive"").

   - **No**: No details about methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The focus is solely on thoughts.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current** feelings and struggles. No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""ideations of suicide"") place this beyond ""indicator.""  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out ""behavior.""  
   - No description of past actions rules out ""attempt.""

I just want connection. I can't take this anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""killing myself"" directly references suicide.  
   - Strong emotional indicators: loneliness, despair (""I can't take this anymore""), hopelessness (""I never will [have friends]""), and self-loathing (""What the fuck is wrong with me?"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no mention of weapons, pills, notes, or plans).  
   - No references to past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""killing myself"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plans or methods**: The post expresses suicidal thoughts but lacks details about how, when, or where the act would occur.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **current** feelings and thoughts (""I wouldn’t be thinking about,"" ""I’m starting to believe""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit mention of suicidal intent (""killing myself"") rules out *indicator*.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out *behavior*.  
   - No description of past suicide actions rules out *attempt*.  
   - The post fits **ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""thinking about killing myself"") without specificity about plans or methods.

It feels like I'm strapped with heavy,ocked chains to the driver's seat of a car that has no brakes and is going at highway speed at night with weak lights and I have no idea where I'm going, and I want the constant anxiety and sadness of my pointles situation to stop by crashing into another car an frequently come close to doing it but never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact and that I'll just end up with pain that doesn't kill me and that I'll be restrapped into the car again.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post uses a metaphor of being strapped to a car with no brakes, going at high speed, expressing a desire to end ""constant anxiety and sadness"" by ""crashing into another car."" It explicitly mentions wanting to die to stop suffering and frequently coming close to acting on this desire but not doing so due to fear of surviving. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (""pointless situation"") and despair. A specific method (car crash) is mentioned, but no explicit preparations (e.g., planning a location or acquiring means) are described. References to past attempts are absent; ""frequently come close"" indicates urges or near-actions, not actual attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but there is a direct expression of wanting to die: ""I want the constant anxiety and sadness... to stop by crashing into another car."" This is an explicit desire to not be alive, so it goes beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""crashing into another car."" However, there is no indication of concrete planning, preparation (e.g., choosing a time, location, or gathering tools), or self-harming behavior. ""Frequently come close to doing it"" suggests recurrent urges but not actionable steps. Since the method is specified but planning is uncertain, the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when unsure applies.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and ongoing urges (""frequently come close""), not past events. No past attempts are referenced; ""never can"" confirms no action was taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die via car crash) and a specific method, which initially suggests 'behavior.' However, without evidence of a plan or preparations, and given the uncertainty rule (favor 'ideation' over 'behavior' when planning is unclear), 'ideation' fits best. The core is the expressed desire to end life with a method, but no actionable plan or behavior is detailed.

My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions feeling ""empty loneliness,"" abuse from job and parents, and frustration with a friend. Most critically, it explicitly states, ""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."" This indicates a direct expression of suicidal intent. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair, but no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""I'm going to kill myself"" is a direct statement of wanting to die.
   - Direct expressions of not wanting to be alive are present: ""I'm going to kill myself"" confirms a desire to end life.
   - Since suicide is explicitly stated, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are mentioned. The phrase ""Only a matter of when"" implies timing but does not detail a plan, method, or preparation (e.g., acquiring means or writing a note).
   - Without explicit planning, per the rules, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I'm going to kill myself""), not past events. There is no description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of suicide and desire to die rules out 'indicator'. The lack of specific plans or methods means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' (which requires explicit planning). No past attempts are described, so it is not 'attempt'. This aligns with 'ideation', defined as explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""death is an option"" and discusses a hypothetical scenario of dying in an accident, framing it as ""not the worst outcome."" However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, or a desire to die by one's own actions. The user explicitly states, ""I won't commit,"" indicating no intention to act. Emotional indicators include a resigned or passive acceptance of death, but no expressions of active despair, hopelessness, or intent. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned as a personal desire or action. The user questions whether thinking death is an option constitutes a ""suicidal thought"" but does not endorse it personally. There are no direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" Instead, the tone is speculative and avoidant of active suicide. Since it's unclear if this qualifies as explicit ideation, we lean toward 'indicator' per the rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are mentioned. The reference to an accident is external and not controllable by the user, so it does not indicate planning. Uncertainty would default to 'ideation' over 'behavior', but no plan exists here.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current thoughts in a hypothetical context (e.g., ""if somehow I got an accident""). There are no references to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows general distress or resignation about life/death but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. The user denies committing suicide, and the discussion is philosophical rather than actionable. This aligns with the 'indicator' category, which includes vague feelings about death without explicit suicide mentions, even with hopeless undertones. Rules emphasize choosing 'indicator' when suicide isn't explicitly stated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill me,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. It expresses emotional distress with ""I wish I didn't have to do this,"" showing reluctance and despair. Specific preparations are noted: ""I even have the stuff prepared and everything,"" implying means for suicide have been acquired. The phrase ""it's been a year since I planned this"" refers to past planning but no past attempt is described; the focus is on imminent action (""Tonight is the last chance"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""kill me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. Therefore, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods are not detailed, but preparations are explicitly stated (""have the stuff prepared""). This constitutes explicit planning, as ""stuff"" implies tools or means suitable for suicide. Thus, this meets the 'behavior' criteria.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post emphasizes current/future intentions (""Tonight is the last chance,"" ""I won't lose the opportunity""). Past events are limited to planning (""planned this""), not a described attempt, so it does not qualify as 'attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of suicide rules out 'indicator'. The presence of preparations (""stuff prepared"") elevates it beyond 'ideation' (which lacks a plan) to 'behavior'. Since no past attempt is described, 'attempt' is not applicable. The rules state that explicit planning or preparation indicates 'behavior', and there is no uncertainty here.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide/self-harm: Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and describes stopping eating to starve, hoping the body breaks down and life ends.
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""I see no reason to fuel it""), despair (""I hate my body""), and low self-worth.
   - Specific plans or methods: Describes a decision to stop eating altogether as a method to induce starvation, with the intent that it leads to death (""I hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"").
   - References to past attempts: None; the post focuses on current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive are present (""this just ends"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method mentioned: Stopping eating to starve, which is a form of self-harm with lethal potential.
   - Signs of preparation: The user states a clear decision (""I've decided to stop eating all together""), indicating intent to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current/future intentions (e.g., ""I've decided,"" ""I hope""), not past events. No description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned, ruling out 'indicator'.
   - A specific method (starvation) and preparation (decision to stop eating) are described, which aligns with the 'behavior' category (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts with a plan or method).
   - Not 'ideation' because there is a plan, not just thoughts.
   - Not 'attempt' as no past suicide actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains multiple explicit references to suicide (""Suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""take my own life,"" ""end myself"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly describes self-harm with suicidal intent, e.g., ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" and ""Goodbye.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and despair are present, e.g., ""I am not a good person,"" ""my death will only benefit people,"" and ""it took me years to decide this but now I just want to get it over with.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Detailed methods are described, including researching the radial artery location, marking it, and using a dremel with a saw attachment to slit wrists. This indicates concrete preparation and execution.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past attempts; the action is described as current or just completed (e.g., ""I just slit my wrists,"" ""if you are seeing this then its already too late"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through actions and statements (e.g., ""I just slit my wrists"" implies suicidal intent, and ""my death"" directly references dying). Therefore, it is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods are mentioned (radial artery, dremel with saw attachment) and preparations are detailed (researching, marking, using tools). This goes beyond mere thoughts and constitutes behavior with execution.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post describes a current or immediate action (""I just slit my wrists"") that has been completed by the time of posting, as indicated by ""if you are seeing this then its already too late."" It does not refer to a past attempt from a historical perspective but rather a recent, concrete action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content describes a concrete, executed action of self-harm with suicidal intent, including specific methods and preparations. This fits the 'attempt' category, which focuses on descriptions of past actions (relative to the posting time). It is not 'behavior' because 'behavior' is for plans or preparations without confirmed action, and 'ideation' is ruled out due to the explicit description of the act.

   - Key elements: The user explicitly states ""I'm suicidal myself"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" indicating a direct expression of suicidal thoughts. There are emotional indicators like hopelessness (e.g., feeling life isn't worth it). However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, notes), or references to past attempts. The focus is on the user's internal struggle and secrecy about their feelings, with no action described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""I'm suicidal myself"" is a clear and direct statement. There is also a direct expression of not wanting to be alive: ""I don't want to keep going myself."" This moves beyond vague distress to explicit ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The user only describes thoughts and feelings, not plans or behaviors.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The suicidal thoughts are described in the present tense (e.g., ""I'm suicidal myself,"" ""I don't want to keep going""), indicating current feelings. There is no reference to past attempts or actions; the user emphasizes they have ""never told anyone,"" which suggests no history of attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm suicidal myself"") and a desire not to be alive, fitting the definition of ""ideation."" There is no evidence of specific plans, methods, or preparations, so it does not qualify as ""behavior."" No past attempts are described, ruling out ""attempt."" Since suicide is explicitly mentioned, it cannot be ""indicator,"" which requires no explicit reference to suicide.

298,If I become worse it's other people's fault. If I become worse and do something bad or kill myself it's everyone else's fault for treating me different. It's not my fault. Everything is thier fault.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:** 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like blaming others (""it's everyone else's fault"") and a sense of hopelessness (""treating me different""), but the key element is the suicidal intent.
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The suicide reference is conditional (""if I become worse"") and not detailed.
   - There are no references to past attempts; the language is future-oriented and hypothetical.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:** 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned with the phrase ""kill myself."" This is a direct expression of wanting to die, even if conditional.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:** 
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations are described. The mention of suicide is general and lacks concrete details about how it would be carried out. Since there is no explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:** 
   - The post refers to potential future actions (""if I become worse and do something bad or kill myself""), not past events. There is no description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:** 
   - The explicit mention of suicide rules out 'indicator'. The absence of a specific plan or method means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. As there is no reference to a past attempt, 'attempt' is not applicable. The post expresses a desire to die (""kill myself"") without detailing how, fitting the 'ideation' definition: explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""I wanted to die when I made that post"", ""I just don't want to die"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""no hope"", ""meaningless torture"", ""desperate""), vulnerability, and despair.  
   - Plans/methods: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Past attempts: No references to past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes: Explicitly states ""I wanted to die"".  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, tools, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - ""Wanted to die"" refers to a past moment (when drafting the deleted post), but expresses ongoing hopelessness. No description of an actual attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""wanted to die"") meets the threshold for **ideation**.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation details → rules out *behavior*.  
   - No description of a past suicide attempt → rules out *attempt*.  
   - Emotional distress alone would be *indicator*, but explicit suicidal desire elevates it to **ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""trying to kill myself"" is a direct reference to suicide. ""I'm ready to say goodbye"" implies thoughts of ending life.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I feel like shit,"" ""I'm pretty much a failure,"" ""I'm so broken and lifeless""), despair, and self-worth issues.
   - Specific plans or preparations: No mention of methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The phrase ""trying to kill myself"" indicates intent but lacks concrete details.
   - References to past attempts: None present; all language is current or future-oriented (e.g., ""at this point"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""trying to kill myself""). This is a direct expression of wanting to die. Ambivalence (""I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not"") doesn't negate the explicitness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are described. The statement is general and lacks actionable details (e.g., how, when, where). Without explicit planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""at this point,"" ""now""). No references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""trying to kill myself"") without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This fits the 'ideation' category, defined as expressions of a desire to die without a concrete plan. Emotional distress alone would be 'indicator', but the explicit suicide mention rules that out. No plan or past attempt shifts it away from 'behavior' or 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: Explicit phrases include ""killing myself,"" ""fear of death,"" ""scared to die,"" and ""hope that I don't wake up"" (indicating a desire for death).
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""It's a neverending cycle. I'm done"") and despair (""all I can do is cry myself to sleep"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are described. The user states ""I could do it right now"" but this is vague and unsupported by details. Parents have ""taken any means,"" implying removed access, but no current preparations are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None present; the focus is on current feelings and barriers (fear of death).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes, ""killing myself"" is a direct reference.
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes, ""hope that I don't wake up"" conveys a desire to not be alive, despite conflicting feelings.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods mentioned: No details on tools, substances, or locations. The reference to parents removing means is indirect and not descriptive of a plan.
   - Signs of preparation: None indicated; the user explicitly states they haven't acted due to fear (""The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared"").
   - Uncertainty about planning: No explicit plan is outlined, so based on rules, lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions: The post discusses present struggles and hypothetical actions (""I could do it right now""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""killing myself,"" desire not to wake up) but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). Rules emphasize choosing 'ideation' if uncertain about planning, and no past attempts are described to warrant 'attempt'.

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating direct expressions of suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no one would miss me,"" ""nothing to live for,"" ""no point in me being alive""), despair (""I hate living with my family,"" ""friendships are kinda failing""), and ambivalence due to fear of death and uncertainty about the afterlife. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I want to kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (""I want to die"").
   - Clear and explicit, so not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances described).
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no notes, means acquisition, or concrete steps).
   - Uncertainty about planning: None evident, so 'ideation' is more appropriate than 'behavior' as per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (""I want to die,"" ""keeping me alive""), not past events.
   - No descriptions of past attempts; all content is present/future-oriented.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die,"" ""I want to kill myself"") but no plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition: explicit expressions of suicidal desires without a specific plan. Fear of death and uncertainty act as barriers but do not introduce planning. Rules state that if no plan is present, it should not be 'behavior', and past attempts are absent, so not 'attempt'. Explicit suicide mentions rule out 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes expressions of distress (""Nothing feels right,"" ""I feel like a broken human being""), hopelessness (""My being in itself is a prison""), guilt (""All I've done for the past few months is cause anguish and pain""), and a direct reference to death (""I'm better off dead""). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""I'm better off dead,"" which is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive. This is not vague; it clearly indicates a wish for death. Therefore, it is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The absence of any plan means this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""Can't stand this anymore""), not past events. There is no mention of past suicide attempts, so it is not 'attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression of a desire to be dead (""I'm better off dead"") fits the 'ideation' category, as it indicates suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method. The emotional distress supports this but does not elevate it to 'behavior' due to the lack of planning. Since there is no past attempt described, 'attempt' is not applicable.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself,"" which directly references suicide. It also describes past preparations: ""my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.""
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses past despair (""It was extraordinarily painful"") but current hope (""I made the decision to live,"" ""light at the end of the tunnel"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Preparations are mentioned, including written suicide letters and a ""set plan,"" though no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are detailed.
   - References to past attempts: The user describes being ""days away"" from acting on their plan but does not indicate a concrete past action (e.g., an actual self-harm incident). It emphasizes proximity to an attempt without stating it occurred.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing myself""), and there is a direct expression of past intent to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are not described (e.g., no mention of tools, substances, or locations), but there are clear signs of preparation: ""letters were written"" and a ""set plan."" This indicates preparatory behavior rather than mere thought.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The suicidal content is entirely in the past tense: ""I came extraordinarily close,"" ""I had a set plan,"" and ""was days away."" The current context is positive, with the user stating they have ""made the decision to live."" There is no description of a concrete past action (e.g., an overdose or injury), only planning and preparation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post cannot be ""indicator"" due to explicit suicide mentions.
   - It cannot be ""ideation"" because specific preparations (written letters, a set plan) are described, moving beyond thoughts alone.
   - It cannot be ""attempt"" because no concrete past action is indicated (e.g., the user was ""days away"" but did not act, and writing letters is preparation, not the attempt itself).
   - ""Behavior"" fits best, as the post includes explicit suicidal expressions and mentions preparatory actions (plan and written notes), even if historical. The definition of ""behavior"" includes preparations like suicide notes, and the temporal context does not exclude past behavior descriptions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive,"" ""wanted things to be over,"" and ""not doing it years ago,"" which strongly imply suicidal thoughts. It expresses anger about not acting on these thoughts in the past and ongoing distress since 2012. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness (e.g., ""wished I wasn't alive"") and despair (e.g., anger about enduring life). However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations. References to the past focus on thoughts and wishes (e.g., ""I thought about it""), not concrete actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly named (e.g., the word ""suicide"" isn't used), but phrases like ""wished I wasn't alive"" and ""wanted things to be over"" are direct expressions of a desire to not be alive. This leans toward 'ideation' rather than 'indicator' because the desire is explicit, even if the term ""suicide"" is absent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post discusses thoughts and regrets but lacks any indication of planning or imminent action. Since there is no explicit plan, this points to 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to past and ongoing feelings (since 2012), with phrases like ""not doing it years ago"" and ""wish that I had just done it"" indicating regret over not acting on past suicidal thoughts. However, there is no description of a past attempt (e.g., no mention of actions taken to harm oneself), only thoughts. Current expressions are about enduring life and anger, not active plans for the future.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit expressions of a desire to not be alive, fitting the 'ideation' category (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). It does not qualify as 'indicator' because the desire is explicit, not vague.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""ive never been more suicidal in my life,"" which explicitly references suicide and indicates high emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness and despair due to recent events (trespassing, family trouble).
   - There are no specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide described (e.g., no mention of plans, notes, weapons, or substances).
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present; the focus is on current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the word ""suicidal.""
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of a desire not to be alive (""suicidal in my life"" implies current suicidal thoughts).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans for suicide are identified. The post describes the consequences of past actions (trespassing) but not any suicidal behavior or preparation.
   - Since there is no indication of planning, this does not meet the threshold for 'behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal feelings are expressed in the present tense (""ive never been more suicidal""), indicating current ideation, not past actions. The post refers to a past event (trespassing yesterday) but not to any historical suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts without any plan or method aligns with the 'ideation' category. 'Ideation' covers explicit expressions of a desire to die or not be alive, as seen here. It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and it is not 'attempt' because no past suicide attempts are described. The explicit suicide reference rules out 'indicator.'

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses extreme dissatisfaction, hopelessness, and feelings of oppression (""prison colony,"" ""slaves,"" ""no freedom,"" ""controlled"").  
   - It uses historical analogies (Auschwitz, Hitler) to describe societal conditions but contains **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or personal desire to end life**.  
   - Emotional indicators include despair and powerlessness but focus on systemic issues, not personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post includes ""I just want to die and go to Heaven,"" which directly expresses a desire to die. It also references Heaven in a context that implies death as a relief.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I feel so alone in the world""), despair (""it just hurts so much""), and worthlessness (""nobody seems to think about me at all""). Fear about the future (""college... seems so terrifying"") is also present.
   - Specific plans or methods: No mention of any suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: None. The post focuses on current feelings and future anxieties, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""I just want to die,"" which is a direct expression of wanting not to be alive. The religious context (""go to Heaven and be with Jesus"") reinforces this as a desire for death. This is not vague; it is explicit, so it moves beyond the ""indicator"" category.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances). There are no signs of preparation or planning. The post expresses a desire but lacks concrete details about how the suicide would occur.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current feelings (""right now,"" ""I just want"") and future fears (going to college), with no references to past suicide attempts. The desire to die is presented as a present wish.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression ""I just want to die"" clearly indicates suicidal thoughts, placing this in at least the ""ideation"" category. However, there is no evidence of a specific plan or preparations, so it does not meet the criteria for ""behavior."" No past attempts are described, ruling out ""attempt."" The emotional distress alone would not qualify as ""indicator"" due to the explicit suicidal desire. Therefore, ""ideation"" is the best fit.

   - The explicit mention of suicidal thoughts without a plan or behavior aligns with the 'ideation' category. The definition of 'ideation' covers explicit expressions of a desire to die or commit suicide without specific plans. Since there is no evidence of planning or preparation, and the rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, 'ideation' is the best fit. This does not meet 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly stated, nor 'behavior' or 'attempt' due to the absence of plans or past actions.

311,"I want to help my suicidal online friend who has been through literal hell but I don't know how and I'm scared. I've only known this person for 2 weeks but we got really close in that amount of time and Jesus fucking Christ have they gone through a lot. I've tried to be a good friend and support them. They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""end my own life"", ""killing myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""numbers dwindle by the day""), utilitarian rationale for suicide, self-directed anger, feeling unable to counter suicidal logic.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).
   - No references to past attempts; focuses on current thoughts and future impact.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Direct expressions include ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself"".

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No. The post discusses philosophical justification (""utilitarian"") and emotional conflict but lacks any concrete plan, method, or preparatory actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""I haven't been able to convince myself recently""). Mentions past self-harm but explicitly states it was non-suicidal (""damage [...] my own when I was alone"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, satisfying criteria for **ideation**.
   - Absence of specific plans/methods/preparations rules out **behavior**.
   - No description of past suicide attempts rules out **attempt**.
   - Philosophical framing and emotional distress alone don’t override explicit suicidal intent.

I won't ever be happy in this world and how it is now. Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure. I'm from the UK, so i can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything. Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I won't ever be happy in this world""), despair (""Everything is a chore, everyday is pressure""), and recurring negative thoughts. 
   - It explicitly mentions a desire to ""end it all"" and not wanting ""to be here,"" which indicates suicidal intent.
   - A specific method is referenced: using a gun (""I can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything""). 
   - There is frustration about the lack of access to a ""good option"" for suicide, but no signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means) or concrete plans.
   - No references to past attempts or actions are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated with the word ""suicide,"" but phrases like ""end it all"" and ""solve everything"" (in context of not wanting to be alive) are direct expressions of wanting to die. Therefore, this is not just an indicator; explicit suicidal thoughts are present.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (gun) is mentioned, which aligns with the criteria for ""behavior"" as it involves a ""specific method"" (tools/weapons). 
   - However, the post states inability to access this method (""I can't get hold of a gun""), so there is no indication of active preparation or imminent action. Despite this, the mention of a specific method is sufficient to trigger the ""behavior"" category per the rules, which state that ""specific ideas of how to commit suicide"" should be classified as behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""end it all""), moving it beyond ""indicator."" 
   - It also includes a specific method (gun), which according to the rules (""If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide consider it 'behavior'"") and the behavior definition (mentioning ""specific methods"" like tools/weapons) qualifies as ""behavior."" 
   - Although the method is not accessible, the mention alone meets the threshold for behavior. There is no uncertainty here about the method being specified, so ""ideation"" does not apply. No past attempt is described.
   - Therefore, based on the explicit suicidal thoughts and specific method mention, the classification is ""behavior.""

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not.

So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes intense self-loathing, disgust, and feelings of worthlessness stemming from relationship betrayal and porn addiction.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide as a personal solution (""suicide is seen as a solution to the problem""), direct statements about ending one's life (""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life""), and personal identification with suicidal feelings (""myself included""). It discusses stigma and defends suicide as a rational choice but lacks references to specific methods, preparations, timelines, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I never wished to be born"") and isolation (""No one is really listening"").

A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself. Some day's i wonder if it's even worth it anymore i even got a story about a guy believing im not actually a lesbian. Btw theres about a dozen scars.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses self-harm (cutting) and emotional distress, including feelings of numbness, emptiness, and worthlessness (""i felt numb and empty inside,"" ""i wonder if it's even worth it anymore""). 
   - There is a description of past self-harm incidents (""I've had issues with self harm in the past,"" ""i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain,"" ""there's about a dozen scars""), but no explicit mention of death, dying, or suicide by the author. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair due to invalidation from others (e.g., being called an ""attention seeker,"" crying oneself to sleep). 
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are described; the self-harm is presented as a coping mechanism for emotional pain, not as a suicidal act. 
   - References to suicide involve other people (e.g., others encouraging the girlfriend to kill herself), but the suicide risk must focus solely on the author, per the rules.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned by the author. The phrase ""i wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" suggests general hopelessness but does not directly express a desire to die, end life, or commit suicide. 
   - There are no direct statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to be alive."" 
   - Since the expression is vague and not explicit, this leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned by the author. 
   - The self-harm (cutting) is described in the context of past behavior to relieve pain, not as part of a suicide plan or preparation. 
   - Without explicit planning or current intent, this does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. If uncertain, the rules advise choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior', but here there is no ideation to begin with.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post primarily references past events (self-harm incidents from months ago) and current emotional struggles, but no future intentions or plans are indicated. 
   - The self-harm is not described as a past suicide attempt; the author frames it as a way to ""relieve some of the pain,"" which lacks suicidal intent. Therefore, it does not qualify as 'attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The author expresses significant distress, invalidation, and hopelessness, but there is no explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. Self-harm alone, without suicidal intent, does not constitute suicide risk under the given definitions. 
   - The vague statement about life not being ""worth it"" is insufficient for 'ideation', as per the rules: ""If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'."" 
   - Given the lack of explicit suicide content, and leaning toward 'indicator' when unclear, this post fits the 'indicator' category.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""act on my suicidal thoughts"". 
   - Expresses hopelessness (""spiraling worse,"" ""hell of a depressive spell"") and barriers to care (insurance, job concerns). 
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or tools for suicide described. 
   - No references to past suicide attempts. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"".

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

They will pay for how they made me feel! Soon I will be finally dead.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains key elements such as explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""), emotional indicators of hopelessness and anger, and specific self-harming behavior (daily heroin use). The heroin use is presented in the context of causing death soon, implying it may be a method to achieve this. There is no mention of a specific suicide plan beyond the heroin use, and no references to past suicide attempts—only a past experience with antipsychotics.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead""). This is explicit suicidal ideation, moving beyond vague distress.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods are indirectly indicated through daily heroin use, which is a lethal substance that can cause death. The context ties this behavior to the expectation of death (""Soon I will be finally dead""), suggesting it is part of a plan or preparation. This meets the criteria for 'behavior' due to the explicit self-harming action combined with suicidal intent.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post focuses on current and future intentions (e.g., ""soon I will be finally dead"" and ongoing heroin use). There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit suicidal thoughts (ideation) are present, but the daily heroin use constitutes self-harming behavior with a clear method (substance abuse) tied to the desire to die. This aligns with the 'behavior' category, which includes expressions of suicidal thoughts combined with mentions of methods or harmful actions. There is no uncertainty about the method (heroin as a means), so 'ideation' is not chosen over 'behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions using a gun to target the brain stem, indicating a specific suicide method.
   - Emotional indicators include dismissing concerns about family, regret, or future opportunities, showing hopelessness and detachment.
   - Specific methods/preparations: The question about ""position of the gun"" implies planning for lethal self-harm.
   - No references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - While the word ""suicide"" isn’t used, phrases like ""hitting the brain stem"" (a lethal act) and dismissing reasons to live explicitly convey intent to die. Thus, it exceeds vague distress and indicates a desire to end life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (gun) and anatomical target (brain stem) are mentioned. The query about positioning shows active consideration of implementation, indicating preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Focuses on current/future intent (planning how to execute the act), not past events.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (gun) and planning (optimizing position) meets the **Behavior** criteria. Rules state mentioning tools (gun) and methods qualifies as Behavior, even if brief. Uncertainty would default to Ideation, but the specificity here is clear.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""thought about killing myself"" directly states suicidal ideation.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""everything just keeps getting worse"" signals hopelessness.  
   - Self-harm evidence: ""mum saw my self harm scars"" confirms past self-harm, but no active suicide plan.  
   - No specific methods, preparations, timelines, or future intentions mentioned.  
   - Reference to self-harm scars is past behavior, not a suicide attempt.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations, or future plans described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") qualify for **Ideation**.  
   - No plan/method moves it away from **Behavior**.  
   - Self-harm ≠ suicide attempt (**Attempt** requires past suicidal action).  
   - Distress/hopelessness alone would be **Indicator**, but explicit suicide mention overrides this.  
   - Rules: When no plan exists, choose **Ideation** over **Behavior**; past self-harm doesn’t change current classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""killing myself"" is explicit.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""feel like trash,"" ""sick of life,"" and hopelessness (""only way out"").  
   - Plan/method: No specific tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""killing myself"").  
   - Direct expressions: ""I’m convinced my only way out is killing myself"" and ""I’m sick of life"" show a desire to not be alive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods (e.g., tools/substances) or preparations (e.g., notes) mentioned. Phrases like ""Let’s just do it"" imply intent but lack specificity.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings/future intent (""way out,"" ""let’s just do it""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire confirms this is beyond ""indicator.""  
   - Absence of concrete plans/methods rules out ""behavior.""  
   - No description of past suicide actions rules out ""attempt.""  
   - Fits ""ideation"": Explicit wish to die without a defined plan.

324,"Just a few more hours. Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again. I'm just so tired. Not even sleep can fix this type of tired. My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better. I am not fighting anymore because I give up. I give up fighting for a body that I don't want to live in anymore. I am living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that wants to die. My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: Explicit references include ""I want to die,"" ""I'm going to attempt again,"" ""I've tried to overdose three times,"" and ""my mind wants to die.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (e.g., ""I give up,"" ""I don't want to get better""), despair (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and emotional exhaustion (""I'm just so tired"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Past methods are specified (""overdose""), but the future intent (""I'm going to attempt again"") lacks details on method, timing (beyond ""a few more hours""), or preparations. No current tools, locations, or actions like acquiring means are described.
   - References to past attempts: Explicitly stated with ""I've tried to overdose three times"" and ""after my first attempt.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""attempt again"" (contextually meaning suicide attempt), ""I want to die,"" and ""my mind wants to die.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods are mentioned only for past attempts (""overdose""). The future intent (""attempt again"") is vague and does not specify a new method, location, or preparation, so it relies on past context without explicit current planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Refers to past attempts (""overdose three times,"" ""first attempt"") and expresses current/future intentions (""I'm going to attempt again"" in a few hours).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and past attempts, but the future intent lacks a specific plan or preparation, leaning toward 'ideation' based on uncertainty about explicit planning. However, per the IMPORTANT RULES, if a post references past attempts and also mentions current plans, it must be classified as 'attempt' (as stated: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'""). Here, both elements are present, so 'attempt' overrides other categories.

My father is a pedophile,  my family on both sides wants nothing to do with me. And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post describes multiple life stressors, including family issues, relationship problems, grief from a friend's death, and alcoholism. Emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I've been fighting it but I can't anymore"") and despair (""I just want this pain to end"") are present.
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: There is no explicit mention of suicide, death, or self-harm. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" expresses a desire for relief but does not directly reference dying or suicide.
   - Specific plans or methods: None identified. No tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: None. The mention of the friend drowning and the mother's health issues relates to others, not the author's own actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). There are no direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or ""I want to kill myself."" The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is vague and could imply emotional relief rather than a desire to die. Since it is unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances for suicide) or preparations are described. The alcoholism is mentioned as a problem, not as a suicide method. With no explicit planning, 'ideation' is not applicable.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and ongoing struggles. There is no reference to past suicide attempts by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is general and does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' (which requires explicit desire to die). According to rules, vague feelings or high distress without explicit suicide mention fall under 'indicator'. When in doubt, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. Therefore, 'indicator' is the best fit.

326,Fuck this. I finally admitted to my mom that I'm suicidal and don't think I'll make is past this summer and she smirked and rolled her eyes. Maybe it is time for me to fucking go.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal"" and includes phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go,"" which directly reference suicidal intent and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: There are strong expressions of hopelessness and despair, such as the reaction from the mother (e.g., ""she smirked and rolled her eyes""), amplifying feelings of isolation and worthlessness.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No details about methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparatory actions (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The references to timing (""this summer"") and intent are vague.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts; the focus is on current feelings and future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""I'm suicidal"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (e.g., ""don't think I'll make it past this summer,"" ""time for me to fucking go"").
   - Since suicide is explicitly stated, this cannot be 'indicator' and leans toward 'ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods: None identified (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or substances).
   - Signs of preparation: None described (e.g., no notes, means acquisition).
   - Uncertainty about planning: The temporal reference (""this summer"") implies intent but lacks concrete details. Following the rule, if no explicit plan is present, this should default to 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions: The post discusses present suicidal feelings (""I'm suicidal"") and future expectations (""don't think I'll make it past this summer""), not past events.
   - Past attempts: Not described or implied.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'm suicidal"") and expressions of a desire to die, meeting the 'ideation' definition.
   - However, there is no specific plan, method, or preparation described. The statement about ""this summer"" is indicative of intent but is too vague to constitute a plan, so it does not qualify as 'behavior'.
   - No past attempts are mentioned, ruling out 'attempt'.
   - Rules applied: The risk is for the user (writer), and when uncertain about planning, 'ideation' is chosen over 'behavior'. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore. I cant do this. I have made so many mistakes. I am trash. I just wanted to say i am sorry to this world, for being born, for being a mentally disabled piece of shit who doesnt know how to act appropriately. I'm so sorry. I'm a disgrace to society and to my family. I have heard hanging is painless, at least I hope it is. Please. If you all hate me, i understand. I hate myself too. I just wanted to say im sorry. I'm so sorry. There is no putting me back together. Im broken. I'm damaged. I'm all fucked up. I should have killed myself a long time ago. Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn't work.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: ""I should have killed myself"", ""I tried"", ""I promise I won't fail this time"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness, self-hatred, worthlessness (""I am trash,"" ""broken,"" ""damaged"").  
   - Specific plans/methods: ""I have heard hanging is painless,"" ""gonna buy the right stuff,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""  
   - Preparation signs: Buying tools, saying goodbyes, setting a timeline (""after this weekend"").  
   - Past attempts: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""tried,"" ""won’t fail this time"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Hanging.  
   - Preparation: Buying materials (""the right stuff""), farewells, set deadline.  
   - Clear intent to act imminently.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past attempts referenced (""I tried""), but emphasis is on **current/future intent** with concrete plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicide desire + specific method (hanging) + active preparations (buying tools, timeline) = **Behavior**.  
   - Past attempts (""tried"") alone would suggest ""Attempt,"" but **active planning dominates** the narrative.  
   - Rules prioritize current plans over past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""killing myself"" with future timelines (25/30 years old).  
   - Expressions of hopelessness (""this life for me isn’t it""), gratitude/apology (common in suicidal notes), and ambivalence (""still have time to rethink"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Refers to a distant future intent (""8 yrs or so""), not past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""killing myself"" and implies intent to die (""Adios"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Mentions timelines (age 25/30) but lacks any details about *how* suicide would be carried out.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intentions**, not past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire qualifies beyond ""indicator.""  
   - Absence of specific methods/preparations rules out ""behavior.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses the user's distress about being perceived as male and a threat as a queer person, references suicide statistics (""suicide rate for men is four times as high""), and expresses respect for cismen. Key phrases: ""teetering on the edge"" (metaphorical distress), ""suicide rate"" (statistical reference). No explicit personal expressions of wanting to die, self-harm, methods, plans, or past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). Suicide is mentioned indirectly via statistics, not as a personal intention.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No mention of methods, tools, preparations, or locations related to self-harm/suicide.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to current feelings (""lately"") and general statistics, not past personal actions or future plans.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post shows distress and references suicide conceptually, it lacks explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. The mention of suicide rates is observational, not self-referential. Falls under vague distress without explicit suicidal intent.

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions suicide in the context of the user's mom's opinion (""suicide is a coward way to go out""), but this is not the user's direct expression. The user then states, ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours,"" which implies potential self-inflicted death, especially given the farewell tone (""Peace out all"") and emotional indicators like hopelessness (sad emoticon "":(.""). There are no specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or references to past attempts described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the post, but only as a quote from the user's mom. The user's own statement (""if I'm gone within 24 hours"") is an indirect reference to death or suicide, not an explicit expression like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself."" Since it is unclear whether this is an explicit expression of suicidal desire by the user, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The statement is vague about how the user might be ""gone,"" so there is no explicit plan. This supports classification as 'ideation' if suicidal thoughts were explicit, but since they are not, it remains in the 'indicator' or 'ideation' boundary.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to a potential future event (""within 24 hours"") and includes a farewell, but it does not describe any past attempts or actions. The focus is on current/future intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The user expresses hopelessness and a potential for self-harm through phrases like ""if I'm gone within 24 hours"" and the sad farewell. However, this does not meet the threshold for 'explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts' as defined for 'ideation' because the desire to die is implied rather than directly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or explicit suicide mention by the user about themselves). The mention of suicide is attributed to the mom, not the user's own intent. According to the rules, when in doubt about explicit mention, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There is no specific plan for 'behavior' and no description of past actions for 'attempt'. Thus, the best fit is 'indicator', as the post shows distress and indirect references but lacks explicit suicidal expression by the user.

My parents bullied and emotionally manipulated me into dropping accusations against them, and they successfully manipulated me into believing I'm their abuser and they're my innocent victims, and I tearfully apologized to them.

My parents are also trying to prevent me from moving out. I want so badly to get a restraining/no-contact order against them both, but I have no proof.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions severe emotional distress, hopelessness, and feeling trapped due to ongoing abuse and manipulation by parents. 
   - Uses the phrase ""it's killing me"" metaphorically to express emotional pain. 
   - No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or past attempts. 
   - No indications of plans, methods, preparations, or suicidal intent. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""self harm"" multiple times, including relapse after four months (""bloodying myself up now"").  
   - Explicitly states ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" and ""I should do it now and save time.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won’t end badly"") and failure to uphold promises to stop self-harm.  
   - No specific suicide method, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Focuses on current self-harm and suicidal intent, with no reference to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""kill myself"" and ""I should do it now.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) mentioned.  
   - Self-harm is described but is distinct from a suicide plan per category definitions.  
   - Uncertainty → Leans toward ""ideation"" over ""behavior"" (rules specify default to ""ideation"" without explicit plans).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses current self-harm relapse and imminent suicidal intent (""do it now"").  
   - No past suicide attempts referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") meets ""ideation"" criteria.  
   - Absence of specific plans/preparations excludes ""behavior.""  
   - Current self-harm alone does not override category rules; suicide intent lacks actionable details.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""someone blow my head off,"" ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me"" explicitly reference death and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair (""im fucking done,"" ""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people""), hopelessness, guilt (""before i hurt someone""), and self-loathing (""i always fucking wonder what people would think if they saw the real fucking me"").
   - Specific plans or preparations: ""Blow my head off"" implies a method (firearms), but it is phrased as a plea to others (""someone,"" ""please kill me""), not as a self-initiated plan. No details on tools, locations, or active preparations (e.g., acquiring means, setting a date).
   - Past attempts: No references to previous suicide attempts or self-harm actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through direct expressions like ""blow my head off"" and ""please kill me,"" which convey a clear desire to die or not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, but it is not framed as a personal plan. Instead, it is a request for someone else to act, with no evidence of user preparation or intent to self-initiate. Due to uncertainty about explicit personal planning, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings (""im fucking done,"" ""please kill me"") with no references to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) and a method, but the method is externalized (requesting others to act), not indicating personal planning or behavior. Since there is no clear evidence of a specific user-initiated plan or preparations, and based on the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain, the best fit is 'ideation'. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to explicit suicide mentions, and there is no description of past actions for 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life,"" which are direct references to suicide. It expresses hopelessness and despair about the future, including anxiety about graduation, inability to maintain employment, and fear of homelessness. However, there are no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) described. No past attempts are referenced; the focus is on current/future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life,"" which are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans are mentioned. The references to ending life are vague and hypothetical (e.g., ""if I ended my life right now""), with no details on how, where, or when it would occur. There are no signs of preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and future-oriented thoughts (e.g., ""if I ended my life right now""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end life) place this beyond 'indicator.' However, the absence of a specific plan or method means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.' Since it describes current ideation without past actions, it is not an 'attempt.' Therefore, it best fits 'ideation,' which covers explicit desires to die without concrete plans.

Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes explicit references to suicide, such as ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" and a detailed description of a suicide attempt (""Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"").
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, despair, self-hatred, and failure (e.g., ""My whole life I've been a failure,"" ""I despise myself,"" ""I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The method is explicitly described (overdosing on muscle relaxers and pain killers), and there is a reference to acquiring means (taking the pills).
   - References to past attempts: The post describes two failed suicide attempts in the last 4 days, including the specific pill overdose from yesterday.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes, through phrases like ""end it all"" and ""I want to die.""
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes, e.g., ""I want to die"" and ""honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning.""
   - No need to lean toward 'indicator' since the mentions are explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes, the use of ""2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" constitutes a specific method involving substances.
   - Signs of preparation: Yes, the act of taking the pills implies preparation and acquisition of means.
   - No uncertainty; this is explicit planning and action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to past events: The suicide attempts are described as having occurred in the recent past (e.g., ""failed twice in the last 4 days"" and ""yesterday"").
   - Past attempts specifically described: Yes, the pill overdose is a concrete past action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes past suicide attempts (e.g., taking pills with the intent to die), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category. Although there are expressions of current suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""), the focus is on the historical actions. Per the rules, when past attempts are described, even with current plans mentioned, the classification is 'Attempt'. This is not 'Behavior' because it involves an actual attempt, not just planning, and not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' due to the explicit description of actions.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

We are working longer and harder for less and less all to satisfy endless Billionaire greed. A factory worker in the 50s-70s had a higher standard of living than a young professional does now. Being a Man it is hard for me to find love and I am attacked for dating to have standards (just want a fair deal (and no I am not talking about looks); I am not asking for some blonde hair princess). Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite /s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life. My parents won't accept me for who I am because I do not believe the harsh faith I was raised and have no way out cause I don't have a loving partner to go to. And I have other issues with them. You try living through South Asian Muslim culture (even in the west). I have nothing but whenever I complain I'm attacked, victim blames, and some sociopath out here is going to kick me when I am down. 99% of your life is luck; that's one thing I'm sure off.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep dissatisfaction with life, hopelessness (""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse""), despair, and feelings of victimization.  
   - Mentions lifelong bullying, family rejection, loneliness, and societal injustice.  
   - **No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm**. Emotional distress is present but framed as external circumstances (luck, systemic issues) causing suffering.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No direct expressions** of wanting to die, end life, or commit suicide. Phrases like ""life sucks"" or ""total curse"" denote anguish but **not suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of methods (e.g., weapons, substances), locations, preparations, or self-harm actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **past/present suffering** (bullying, family strife) and societal critique. **No references to past suicide attempts or future plans**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - While the post shows severe hopelessness, it lacks **explicit suicidal ideation, plans, or behaviors**. General distress without direct suicide references falls under **indicator** per guidelines.  
   - Rules emphasize: ""When in doubt whether suicide was explicitly mentioned, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm feeling suicidal"", ""my suicidal thoughts are getting more and more"", ""the only escape to this situation is suicide"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I feel like a burden""), despair (""not able to deal""), panic attacks, insomnia.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - No references to past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times with direct expressions of wanting to die as an escape.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, notes) are mentioned.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers exclusively to current emotional state and future fears; no past attempts described.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present without any plan details or preparatory actions. Meets ""Ideation"" criteria (explicit desire to die without specific plans). Absence of methods/preparations rules out ""Behavior"". No past attempts mentioned, so ""Attempt"" doesn't apply. Emotional distress alone would be ""Indicator"", but explicit suicide references override this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""suicide ideation,"" ""end it,"" and references to past attempts (e.g., ""the times I have tried,"" ""the first time I actually attempted""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I am left wanting to jump,"" ""nobody would care,"" ""my heart is too tired and fragile"") and despair about life circumstances.
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink,"" with details about knowing the train schedule and proximity to the tracks. The user describes preparatory behavior, such as going to the tracks but jumping away due to panic, indicating repeated engagement with the method.
   - Past attempts are explicitly described: the user references multiple times they ""tried"" and one ""actually attempted"" where a friend called 911.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide ideation,"" ""attempted""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die, like ""I am left wanting to jump"" and ""this is all I have left.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned (jumping in front of a train), and there are signs of preparation, such as knowing the train schedule and repeatedly being at the tracks. This indicates explicit planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past attempts (e.g., ""the times I have tried"") and also discusses current intentions, such as ""wanting to jump"" and seeking advice on overcoming hesitation (""How do I stay on the tracks?"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Based on the rules, the post describes past suicide attempts (qualifying for 'attempt'). Additionally, the note states: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, current plans are mentioned alongside past attempts, so 'attempt' is the appropriate category. While current planning might suggest 'behavior', the explicit rule for mixed temporal context overrides this.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes feelings of being a burden, severe social isolation (not leaving home since age 14), unemployment, dependency (living at home), and inactivity (laying in bed all day). There are emotional indicators of hopelessness and distress, but no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific plans/methods, preparations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive (e.g., no terms like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die""). The content expresses general dissatisfaction and despair but lacks direct suicidal expressions. Leaning toward 'indicator' as per the rule for unclear cases.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are referenced. The focus is on life circumstances, not actionable plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses ongoing and past life situations (e.g., isolation since age 14), but no references to past suicide attempts or future suicidal intentions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows significant distress and hopelessness, but it does not include explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. According to the category definitions, ""indicator"" applies when there is no explicit mention of suicide, even with strong dissatisfaction. The rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned reinforces this classification.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire + specific method/timeframe qualifies as **behavior** (per definition: ""mentions a plan... specific method""). 
   - No ambiguity about planning; rules specify to choose 'behavior' when methods are named.

   - No references to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die, fitting 'ideation'.
   - However, it lacks a specific plan or method, and preparations are not explicit enough for 'behavior'. Rules state to choose 'ideation' when uncertain about planning.

Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present, e.g., ""It's all bullshit,"" ""People like me are sick,"" and ""I should be allowed assisted suicide."" However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, or substances), preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), or descriptions of past attempts. The reference to ""assisted suicide"" is a general statement about a desire for the option, not a personal plan or action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""I want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal""), confirming a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. The mention of ""assisted suicide"" is vague and not indicative of personal planning or imminent action; it reflects a wish rather than concrete steps. With no explicit plan, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and frustrations (e.g., ""when you're constantly suicidal,"" ""I want to kill myself""), with no references to past suicide attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) but no specific plan, method, or preparation, fitting the 'ideation' definition. The absence of actionable details or past attempts rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to explicit suicide mentions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The phrase ""end myself"" is a direct reference to suicide. ""OD on"" (overdose) specifies self-harm through drug use.
   - Emotional indicators: The tone conveys intent and immediacy (""soon""), but no explicit hopelessness or despair is described.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: The post details a method (overdosing) and specific means (1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac), including possession (""have"").
   - References to past attempts: None present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned via ""end myself,"" which is a clear expression of wanting to die or not be alive. Answer: Yes.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: Overdosing (OD) using Benadryl and Prozac, with quantities (1g each).
   - Signs of preparation are evident: The person states they ""have"" the drugs for this purpose, indicating acquisition of means.
   - This confirms explicit planning, so 'behavior' is more appropriate than 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to future intentions (""soon""), not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts (""end myself"") and a specific plan with preparations (possession of drugs for overdose), fitting the 'behavior' definition. It is not 'attempt' as no past action is described, and not 'ideation' due to the presence of a plan. The explicitness rules out 'indicator'.

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes explicit references to suicide (e.g., ""suicide is never the answer,"" ""people who kill themselves,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it""). It also describes self-harm behavior: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut."" Additionally, there is a vivid image of death: ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness, loneliness, and despair (e.g., ""I'm Lonely,"" ""I feel like an inconvenience,"" ""I feel like I just don't fit in,"" ""they would just be better off without me"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: A specific method is mentioned (knife to the wrist), and there are descriptions of preparatory actions: holding a knife to the wrist three times, though not completed.
   - References to past attempts: The user explicitly describes past concrete actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life,"" which indicates past suicide attempts or self-harm with suicidal intent, even though they ""couldn't cut.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide is never the answer,"" ""people who kill themselves"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I feel like I just need to do it,"" ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (knife to the wrist).
   - Yes, there are signs of preparation: The user engaged in behavior by holding a knife to their wrist three times, indicating concrete actions toward suicide, even if not completed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to both past events and current/future intentions. Past attempts are specifically described: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life"" constitutes past concrete actions. Current suicidal ideation is also present (e.g., ""I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead,"" ""I feel like I just need to do it"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post describes past suicide attempts (holding a knife to the wrist three times), which fits the ""Attempt"" category definition (""describes past attempts at suicide""). Even though the attempts were not completed, they represent concrete actions (not mere thoughts). 
   - Additionally, the rule states: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, current suicidal ideation is expressed (e.g., ""I feel like I just need to do it""), reinforcing the ""Attempt"" classification.
   - This is not ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly mentioned. It is not ""Ideation"" because specific methods and past behaviors are described, going beyond mere thoughts. It is not ""Behavior"" because the focus is on past actions (attempts) rather than current plans or preparations.

348,"To anyone that might read this. During lockdown here in Denmark, we had a long winter. I've always felt I've never done what I set out to do and never really connected with people. The lockdown and cold winter put everything that much more true. I've never felt as alone as I did there. I was very depressed, bored and lots of anxiety. Couldn't sleep, woke up multiple times at night. At some point my thoughts came to what if I wasn't in this world. Perhaps I would gain peace? These thoughts scared me. It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""end myself"" and ""end it,"" which are direct references to suicide. Emotional indicators include ""really depressed and sad,"" ""crying basically all night,"" and feelings of helplessness (""idk what to do""). Specific methods are mentioned (""trying to overdose""). The phrase ""again tonight"" indicates a reference to past attempts and a current/future intention.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes, through phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it.""
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes, ""end myself"" and ""end it"" clearly convey a desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods mentioned: Yes, ""trying to overdose"" identifies a concrete method (substance overdose).
   - Signs of preparation: Not explicitly stated (e.g., no mention of acquiring pills or writing a note), but the method is specified, and ""tonight"" implies immediacy.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to both past events and current/future intentions: ""again"" explicitly references past attempts (e.g., ""end myself again""), and ""tonight"" indicates a current/future plan for suicide.
   - Past attempts described: Indirectly, through the word ""again,"" which implies a history of attempts, though not detailed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal expressions and a specific method (overdose), which would typically suggest 'behavior'. However, the critical factor is the reference to past attempts (""again"") combined with current plans (""tonight""). Following the IMPORTANT RULES and category definitions: ""Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Thus, the presence of both elements overrides the 'behavior' classification, making 'attempt' the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""My death will release my pain.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""I can't fight anymore""), exhaustion (""eyelids feel as heavy as boulders""), and worthlessness (""Some people just aren’t meant for this world"").  
   - Plans/methods: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations described.  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life."" Death is framed metaphorically (e.g., cat analogy) or as an inevitability (""My death will release my pain""). Leans toward ""indicator"" due to lack of explicit suicidal terminology.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. Timeframe (""next month or two"") implies intent but lacks actionable specifics.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""next month or two"") with no references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses existential despair and acceptance of death but avoids explicit suicidal language (e.g., ""I want to die by suicide""). The metaphors and general hopelessness align with ""indicator,"" as per rules: ""When in doubt whether suicide was explicitly mentioned, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'."" Absence of plans/rules further rules out ""behavior"" or ""attempt.""

I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more.

I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post includes ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which implies a suicidal method, and explicit reference to ""suicide hotline.""
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of hopelessness (""I don't know what to do,"" ""I feel like I'm a fuck up,"" ""can never get anything right,"" feeling judged by mom) and fear of institutionalization.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""Driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a specific suicide method involving a means (car) and action (crashing into a tree).
   - References to past attempts: None; the post focuses on current thoughts and intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""suicide hotline,"" and ""driving 100 mph into a tree"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. (Yes)

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods mentioned: ""Driving 100 mph into a tree"" details a method (using a vehicle to cause fatal injury).
   - Signs of preparation: The user is ""sitting in my car right now,"" indicating proximity to means, but no explicit preparation (e.g., starting the car) is described.
   - Since a specific method is clearly mentioned, this qualifies as explicit planning. No uncertainty; do not default to 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of...""), not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., wanting to die via a method) and a specific plan (""driving 100 mph into a tree""), aligning with the 'behavior' category. Although it is a thought (""thinking of""), the mention of a concrete method meets the threshold for 'behavior' per the definition. It does not describe a past action, so 'attempt' is incorrect. 'Ideation' would apply if no plan was specified, but here a plan is evident. 'Indicator' is too low as suicide is explicitly referenced.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously"" (explicit past suicide attempt). It also expresses current suicidal intent: ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing."" Emotional indicators include intense regret, self-hatred, hopelessness (""I don't see any future ahead for me""), and overwhelming stress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Suicide is explicitly referenced (""struggled with suicide,"" ""joining her"" implies death, ""my passing""). Direct expressions of future intent to die are present.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned for current suicidal thoughts. The fear of ""joining her"" is unspecific.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Explicitly describes a past suicide attempt (""hospitalised for it previously""). Also expresses current/future suicidal intent but without concrete planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past hospitalization confirms a concrete **attempt** occurred historically.  
   - Current statements (""will be joining her,"" ""my passing"") indicate **ideation**, but no plan details elevate it to ""behavior.""  
   - Rules specify: If a post references past attempts *alongside* current suicidal thoughts, classify as **'attempt'**.  
   - ""Behavior"" is ruled out due to lack of method/preparation details.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and despair (e.g., ""My mind is hell,"" ""I feel so weak, so hopeless,"" ""Nothing makes it go away"").
   - There is a mention of being ""tired of living"" (""I wake up even more tired of living"") and a vague reference to ending something (""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it"").
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die"").
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or substances).
   - No references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on current mental struggles.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned. Phrases like ""tired of living"" and ""stop it"" imply deep distress but lack direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die""). Since it's unclear, this leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The phrase ""stop it"" is ambiguous and not linked to any actionable plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current and ongoing mental struggles since the breakup 6 months ago, with no references to past suicide attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains strong expressions of hopelessness and emotional pain but no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts. According to the definitions:
     - **Indicator** fits because there is no explicit mention of suicide; it includes general distress and vague feelings (like ""tired of living"") without direct suicidal intent.
     - **Ideation** is not applicable since there is no clear desire to die expressed.
     - **Behavior** and **Attempt** are not relevant due to the absence of plans, preparations, or past actions.
   - Per the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned (or unclear), default to 'indicator'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (""contemplate suicide,"" desire to ""not be here""), but no specific plans, methods, or behaviors are indicated. This aligns with **Ideation**, defined as expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

358,"When to know if suicide is better. I've lived for years with trauma, ocd, anhedonia, no friends, abuse, and more since I was 12 or 13. I'm 20 soon and all I have is that. I'm not looking for sympathy or compassion really I'm just looking to know if anyone else feels like the release is better as their life is a bust. To say hey jesus or whatever I had an impossible situation can I go back?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and questions if it is ""better,"" framing it as a potential ""release."" It describes severe emotional distress (trauma, OCD, anhedonia, abuse, isolation) and hopelessness (""life is a bust""). No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts are mentioned.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **Yes**. The phrase ""suicide is better"" directly expresses consideration of suicide, and ""the release"" implicitly refers to death as relief.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **No**. There is no reference to tools, locations, preparations, or concrete steps toward suicide. The focus is on abstract contemplation.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses current suffering and hypothetical consideration of suicide (""is better""), with no mention of past actions or attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit mention of suicide and desire for ""release"" aligns with **ideation** (expressing suicidal thoughts without a plan). Absence of methods/preparations rules out ""behavior,"" and no past actions rule out ""attempt."" While distress is severe, explicit suicide references disqualify ""indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions ""sleep forever"" as a metaphor for death, expresses extreme distress (""can't take this shit no more,"" ""sick and tired of my shitty life""), and lists specific medications and quantities (58 pills of 100mg Seroquel, Viepax 150mg/75mg).  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: ""Sleep forever"" implies a desire to die, though ""suicide"" isn't explicitly stated. The phrase is an unambiguous expression of not wanting to be alive.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods (overdosing on named medications) and exact quantities are provided, indicating preparation and access to lethal means.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The language (""wanna,"" ""can't take this now"") points to current/future intent. No past attempts are mentioned.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The combination of explicit desire to die (""sleep forever"") with concrete, actionable details about methods (medications/quantities) aligns with ""behavior.""

He has no motivation to get better, so I can't get better. My kids are growing to resent me. It's not fair to people to have to deal with me. I'm tired of being alive. It hurts.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive,"" which are direct expressions related to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and despair are evident, e.g., ""I'm depressed and I'm miserable,"" ""stuck in a loveless marriage with no way out,"" and ""It hurts.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: None; all statements are about current feelings and situations.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but ""I want to die"" and ""I'm tired of being alive"" are direct expressions of wanting to not be alive. This is explicit enough for 'ideation' rather than 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are described, and there are no signs of preparation. Since there is no plan, this cannot be classified as 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings (e.g., ""I want to die"" in present tense) with no reference to past suicide attempts or historical actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""I'm tired of being alive""), which fits the 'ideation' definition (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). There is no indication of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'behavior'. No past attempts are mentioned, ruling out 'attempt'. The explicit suicidal thoughts elevate it above 'indicator', which requires no explicit mention.

I want this to end but I am scared.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes mentions of past suicide attempts: ""I have tried and bailed out multiple times. I tried with a knife. It didn't work."" This indicates concrete past actions.
   - Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present: ""I hate myself so much,"" ""I want this to end,"" and ""I am scared.""
   - Specific methods and preparations are referenced: ""I have a rope"" (current possession of a means) and ""There's a building"" (consideration of a location), though uncertainty is noted with ""I never checked out the place.""
   - References to past attempts are explicit: ""tried with a knife"" is a described historic action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated with the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of wanting to die or end life, such as ""I want this to end,"" ""I have to do it,"" and ""I should've done it a long time ago."" The context of ""tried with a knife"" and ""bailed out"" confirms suicidal intent. Leaning toward 'ideation' or higher based on explicitness.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are mentioned (knife, rope), and there is preparation (""I have a rope""). However, the building location is not fully acted upon (""I never checked out the place""), and there is ambivalence (""What do I do?""). This suggests planning but not immediate action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to past attempts (""tried with a knife"") and expresses current/future intentions (""I don't want to bail out anymore,"" ""I have to do it""). Current preparations (e.g., having a rope) are also indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes past suicide attempts, which aligns with the 'attempt' category definition. Additionally, the note explicitly states: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, past attempts (""tried with a knife"") are combined with current plans (e.g., ""I have a rope"" and intent not to bail out). Therefore, despite current suicidal thoughts and preparations, the presence of described past attempts mandates classification as 'attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""tired of it,"" ""no point to anything,"" ""useless,"" extreme self-deprecation.
   - Explicit expression: ""I feel pain and i just want to end it"" directly references ending life.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - ""End it"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die (Yes). Though ""suicide"" isn’t used, the phrase is a clear substitute for ending one’s life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes) mentioned. Only a general desire to end life.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - All statements are in present tense (""feel,"" ""want""), indicating current intentions. No past attempts referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (""end it"") meets the threshold for **ideation**. 
   - Absence of plans/methods rules out ""behavior."" No past actions rule out ""attempt."" General hopelessness alone would be ""indicator,"" but the explicit death wish elevates it to ideation.

363,"Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow. But I will, as always. Christmas probably won't be happening this year, that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again. Tired of being alone.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses a desire not to wake up (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow""), indicating a wish to die. It mentions hopelessness (""But I will, as always"") and despair (""Tired of being alone""). It also references a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") and implies a potential future attempt linked to depression from Christmas. No specific methods, plans, or preparations are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is implicitly but clearly expressed through the desire not to wake up, which is a direct wish to not be alive. The phrase ""attempt properly again"" explicitly references suicidal behavior.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The reference to ""attempt properly again"" is vague about planning and focuses on past or potential future actions without details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to both current feelings (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") and a past attempt (""attempt properly again""). The future reference (""that'll probably get me depressed enough to attempt properly again"") is conditional and not a concrete current plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") triggers the 'attempt' category, as per the rule: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, the current suicidal ideation (""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"") is present, but the past attempt is the defining element. No specific plan for current behavior is described, so 'behavior' does not apply. The presence of past attempt takes precedence over 'ideation' due to the explicit rule.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly includes ""looking for someone to kill me,"" ""chop me up,"" and ""hide my body,"" which directly reference dying and violent death.
   - Emotional indicators: The desire for the body to never be found suggests hopelessness and despair about being discovered, but this is secondary to the explicit death-related content.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Methods like ""harvest my organs,"" ""chop me up,"" and ""hide my body"" are specific. The user is actively seeking someone to carry out the killing, indicating preparation.
   - References to past attempts: No mention of past suicide attempts; the focus is on current/future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""looking for someone to kill me"" is a direct expression of wanting to die, which qualifies as explicit under the ideation or behavior definitions. This is not vague; it clearly states a desire not to be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: organ harvesting, chopping up the body, and hiding it. This details how the death should occur, moving beyond mere thoughts to planning. The request for someone to perform the act shows preparation, as it involves arranging for the means (another person) to carry it out.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current intentions (""looking for someone"") and future outcomes (""so that my family will never find out""), not past events. There are no references to historical attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses explicit suicidal thoughts (wanting to die) and includes a specific plan (methods and preparations), so it cannot be 'indicator' or 'ideation'.
   - It does not describe a past suicide attempt, so 'attempt' is not applicable.
   - The presence of a plan (methods like organ harvesting, chopping up, and hiding the body) and preparation (seeking an accomplice) aligns with the 'behavior' category. There is no uncertainty about the plan being explicit, so 'behavior' is chosen over 'ideation' as per the rules.

Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm: The post explicitly includes ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""fantasizing about my death,"" which directly reference suicide and death.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions like ""fed up,"" ""rock bottom lows,"" and ""so fed up with fighting this crap"" convey hopelessness and despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or any concrete steps for suicide. The focus is on thoughts and fantasies.
   - References to past attempts: The user states, ""I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts"" for 10 years and ""I'm still here,"" but there is no description of actual suicide attempts. The phrase ""manageable"" and ""no desire to die"" further suggest no past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts""). 
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: The user says ""I have no desire to die,"" which contradicts explicit desire, but ""fantasizing about my death"" and ""consider it"" (referring to suicide) imply a fluctuating desire. Overall, suicide is explicitly referenced, so this leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are mentioned. 
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present. 
   - Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, 'ideation' is chosen over 'behavior' per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses ongoing struggles (""10 years,"" ""every fucking day"") and current thoughts (""some days I consider it""), not past attempts. The reference to ""fighting"" thoughts is about persistent ideation, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts without any plan or preparation, fitting the 'ideation' definition (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, without a specific plan). 
   - It does not qualify as 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned. 
   - It is not 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, and not 'attempt' as no past suicide actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I just really wish to end my life"" and ""to just end all this,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness (e.g., ""I feel like I'm unimportant,"" ""I just don't have any more options here""). However, there is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The user also states, ""I can't harm myself even in the slightest,"" which suggests an inability to act. There are no references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on current feelings and struggles, such as emotional neglect and inability to seek help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""wish to end my life."" This is a direct expression of wanting to die, so it cannot be classified as 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans are described. The user emphasizes an inability to self-harm, and there is no indication of concrete steps or preparations. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the rule dictates leaning toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current intentions and feelings (e.g., present struggles and wishes), not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts, only historical context about emotional neglect.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to end one's life without a specific plan or method aligns with the 'ideation' category. The absence of actionable plans or past attempts rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt'. Emotional distress alone, even with hopelessness, would not suffice for 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mentions.

   - The post expresses intense emotional distress with phrases like ""I lost control,"" ""I just want to cry,"" ""I can't breathe,"" ""I want to scream help please,"" and ""I don't want to live this again."" These indicate feelings of hopelessness and despair.
   - There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" refers to not wanting to experience a distressing situation again, but it does not explicitly state a desire to die or end one's life.
   - No specific suicide plans, methods, or preparations (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are mentioned.
   - There are no references to past suicide attempts; ""live this again"" is vague and could refer to a past emotional crisis, not necessarily an attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No).
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to live"" without context). The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" is situational, not absolute, so it does not qualify as explicit suicidal ideation. Since it is unclear, the rule is to lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans for suicide are described. The content focuses on emotional turmoil, not actionable steps toward self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post references a past or recurring experience (""live this again""), but it is ambiguous and not described as a suicide attempt. It emphasizes current distress rather than past actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, plans, methods, or past attempts. According to the rules, general dissatisfaction or despair without explicit suicidal content falls under 'indicator'. The ambiguous phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" does not meet the threshold for 'ideation' as it is not an explicit expression of wanting to end one's life. Therefore, 'indicator' is the most appropriate category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post contains explicit mentions of death or dying, such as ""my reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it."" There are strong emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""It's too hard,"" ""this fucking sickness god it's horrible,"" ""I'm tired,"" ""it just keeps getting worse""). Specific preparation is indicated by the line ""I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it,"" which suggests a suicide note. There are no references to specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""my reason to die"" and ""I decided this is it,"" which directly express a desire to not be alive. This is not vague; it is an explicit expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are described, the mention of leaving a suicide note (""I left a note"") constitutes a preparation, as defined under the behavior category (e.g., suicide note as a sign of preparation). This is not uncertain; it is explicit.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current or future intentions (e.g., ""I decided this is it"" in present context) and describes a past action of leaving the note. However, there is no description of a past suicide attempt (e.g., no mention of actions like overdosing). The note is a preparatory step, not an attempt itself.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts (""reason to die,"" ""this is it"") rules out 'indicator'. The lack of a specific method or past attempt rules out 'attempt' (as no concrete suicidal action is described). The mention of preparation (suicide note) moves this beyond 'ideation' (which is for thoughts without plans or preparations) to 'behavior', as the definition includes preparations like leaving a note. Since the preparation is explicit, there is no uncertainty to default to 'ideation'.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions intense hopelessness (""I can't keep doing this anymore""), despair (""I don't deserve anything""), and self-loathing (""I'm a creep"").
   - Explicitly states ""I just. Want. To die"" and references recurring suicidal thoughts since middle school.
   - Asks ""How do I kill myself without leaving a body my parents have to deal with?"" indicating consideration of suicide methods and logistical concerns.
   - Describes past suicidal ideation but no explicit description of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""I just. Want. To die"" and ""kill myself"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes: The question ""How do I kill myself..."" explicitly seeks a suicide method, with specific concern about concealing/disposing of the body to avoid burdening parents. This constitutes planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Primarily expresses current/future intentions (""How do I kill myself...""). References past ideation but no described past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire and active planning (seeking methods while considering consequences) meet the **Behavior** definition. The query about methods/preparations outweighs the absence of named tools/locations. Past ideation doesn't override current planning indicators.

The expressions used (""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" ""eternal void"") are metaphorical and suggestive of suicidal thoughts but not direct. While there is a clear desire to not be alive (e.g., ""I'll be free""), the wording is indirect and relies on idioms. Applying the rule—if unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'—this points to 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""Push me over the edge"" is vague and could imply a method (e.g., jumping), but it is not explicit. Since it is uncertain, the rule dictates choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior' if no plan is clear, but this step is contingent on explicit suicidal thoughts being present, which was not confirmed in the previous step.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""I need something to push me,"" ""One last push is all I need""), not past events. There are no descriptions of past suicide attempts; only general life actions are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains strong expressions of distress and hopelessness, with indirect allusions to death (e.g., ""eternal void""). However, suicide is not explicitly mentioned, and the language is metaphorical. Per the rules, very large general dissatisfaction or hopelessness without explicit suicide mention is 'indicator'. Additionally, the doubt rule applies: when unsure if suicide is explicit, choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'. There is no specific plan (so not 'behavior') and no past attempts (so not 'attempt'). Thus, 'indicator' is the best fit.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses suicide in a general sense (""people who commit suicide""), describing emotional processes (bottling up emotions, breaking down).  
   - No explicit mention of the author's personal suicidal thoughts, plans, methods, or past attempts.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""bottled everything up,"" ""painful emotions,"" ""break down""), but these are framed as a generalized explanation, not a self-report.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is mentioned but only in reference to *other people* (""people who commit suicide"").  
   - No direct expression of the author wanting to die, not wanting to be alive, or personal suicidal intent.  
   → **No explicit personal suicide mention**.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No methods, tools, locations, or preparations described for the author.  
   - No indication of personal planning or imminent action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Discusses a hypothetical/generalized scenario (""people get to that place,"" ""one day we snap"").  
   - No references to the author’s past suicide attempts or behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - While the post normalizes suicide and expresses distress, it lacks **any explicit personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or past attempt** by the author.  
   - General dissatisfaction/hopelessness without explicit suicidal intent falls under **indicator**.  
   - Key rules applied:  
     - Focus solely on the author (not ""people"" in general).  
     - When suicide isn’t explicitly self-referential, default to *indicator*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"" indicates direct suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: Anger (""fuck everyone""), defiance (""giant middle finger""), hopelessness (""I dont owe anybody shit"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""If I kill myself"" is an explicit statement of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No details about methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to hypothetical future actions (""If I kill myself,"" ""before I leave""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""leave this world forever"") meets the threshold for **ideation**.

I have exactly one friend, but I'm becoming extremely frustrated at him, though not through any fault of his own. He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time. I just can't deal with the constant feeling of dread and anxiety. I can't even get up in the morning anymore because being awake at that time just reminds me of getting up for college or school. I hate it. I can't think straight unless it's dark. My family aren't bad people and I had a regular if lonely childhood, but I feel no connection to them. It's horrible because my mum still cooks meals for me and washes my clothes but I feel nothing anymore. Just frustration. I can't motivate myself to stick to anything. I just wrote two stories and can't write anymore. It's gone. I can't get myself to read books consistently. I do it for a month and then stop for three months. How can I get a job when I can't even stick to the things I like doing?. I can't even motivate myself to shower regularly. I only do it when I have to go outside. It's regular for me not to shower for a week, sometimes two. My teeth are just shit. Why can't I get myself to brush? It's such a simple thing and I just can't fucking do it. They're fucked. Where do I see myself in five years? Dead. I can't fucking function in this world. I'm just in a constant state of anxiety and/or depression. It won't leave me alone. I feel like your whole life is just a series of lucky chances and mine weren't so lucky. You might say that I have control over those chances but I disagree. Where does the motivation to enact change come from? I can't just will myself some motivation, it has to come from somewhere external. It comes from favourable circumstances. Life isn't about making something happen, it's about taking opportunities that come to you, and I feel like none have come to me except one.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions extreme hopelessness, depression, and inability to function (""constant feeling of dread and anxiety,"" ""can't motivate myself,"" ""I can't fucking function"").
   - Explicitly states a future expectation of death: ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead.""
   - No references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts.
   - Focuses on emotional distress and perceived lack of control over life circumstances.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**. The statement ""Where do I see myself in five years? Dead"" explicitly expresses a desire/expectation to not be alive. While ""suicide"" isn't used, ""Dead"" in this context directly conveys a wish to end existence.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No specific methods or plans mentioned**. The post describes emotional struggles and functional impairment but lacks references to tools, locations, timelines, or preparations for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current despair and future hopelessness (""five years""). No mention of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression ""Dead"" (indicating a desire/expectation to die) qualifies as suicidal ideation. 
   - Absence of methods, plans, or preparations rules out ""behavior."" 
   - No description of past self-harm actions rules out ""attempt."" 
   - The intensity of hopelessness exceeds general distress but requires explicit suicidal desire for ""ideation,"" which is met here.

   - Emotional elements: References ""pain"" and seeks understanding of others' interventions.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal thought (drowning at 10/11 years old) and current suicidal thoughts (""suicide by a train is on my mind"").  
   - Explicitly references suicide (""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train"").  
   - Describes a specific method (""put neck on the train tracks"") and timing (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").  
   - No description of past suicide *attempts* (childhood incident was ideation, not action: ""thought jumping in"" but ""she convince me not to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes** (""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: Train tracks (""put neck on the train tracks"").  
   - **Preparations/timing**: Explicit future plan (""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Past: Childhood ideation (no attempt).  
   - Present/Future: Current suicidal ideation with explicit plan for future action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicide desire + specific method (train tracks) + concrete plan (18th birthday) = **Behavior**.  
   - Past event describes ideation only (not attempt), so ""attempt"" category does not apply.

I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" explicitly, emotional distress (""rougher weeks,"" ""don´t want to think like this anymore""), and being triggered by someone else's suicide attempt. There is no mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past attempts by the user. The focus is on recurring thoughts about suicide, framed as something that feels more ""real"" or accessible now, but without any actionable intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""end his life"" (referencing another person, but the user applies this to their own experience). There are direct expressions of thinking about suicide, such as ""it´s now ok to try,"" indicating current ideation.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The content is limited to thoughts and feelings, with no indication of planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to past suicidal thoughts (""through my life, but most of them are behind me"") and current resurgence (""I keep thinking about it""). There is no reference to past attempts by the user or future plans—only thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without any plan or behavior, fitting the 'ideation' definition. It lacks the specificity required for 'behavior' (no methods or preparations) and does not describe a past attempt by the user, ruling out 'attempt'. While there is distress, the explicit mention of suicidal thoughts means it cannot be 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The phrase ""just want my life to end"" indicates a desire for life to cease, which relates to suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses hopelessness (""I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated""), despair, and distress through references to ""intrusive thoughts,"" ""compulsions,"" ""rage outbursts,"" and ""depressive episodes.""
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of tools, locations, substances, notes, or other preparations for suicide.
   - References to past attempts: No description or mention of past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but there is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive (""just want my life to end""). This qualifies as an explicit expression of suicidal thoughts, so it is not 'indicator'. Leaning toward 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, drugs, locations) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).
   - Since there is no plan, this does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. If uncertain, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post describes current feelings (""constantly"" having thoughts, ""just want my life to end"") and does not refer to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains an explicit expression of a desire to die (""just want my life to end""), which falls under 'ideation' as it shows suicidal thoughts without a specific plan or method.
   - It does not qualify as 'indicator' because the desire to end life is explicit, nor as 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, nor as 'attempt' as it is not about past actions.
   - Based on the definitions, 'ideation' is the best fit for explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes dissociation, emotional numbness, and past experiences including ""nearly killing myself one night."" It ends with a hypothetical future scenario: ""it'll only take one day where I step off a building or over a bridge without thinking.""  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes – ""nearly killing myself"" explicitly references suicide.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods (""step off a building or over a bridge"") are mentioned as potential future actions. Though phrased hypothetically, the explicit detailing of methods qualifies as planning.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: ""Nearly killing myself"" refers to a past event (potentially an attempt, but ""nearly"" introduces ambiguity). The building/bridge scenario describes a current/future possibility.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention (""killing myself"") confirms beyond *indicator*.  
   - Specific methods (buildings/bridges) indicate planning, moving beyond *ideation*.  
   - No description of active preparations (e.g., seeking locations), but explicit methods align with *behavior*.  
   - ""Nearly killing myself"" is ambiguous (not clearly an actual attempt), so *attempt* doesn’t override the current/future planning.  
   **Conclusion**: Explicit methods mentioned for potential future action qualify as *behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/suicide: ""take myself out"" is a euphemism for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: ""shits not worth it anymore,"" ""disappoint and burden other people,"" ""need a way out,"" ""can't go to anyone,"" ""need it to stop"" convey hopelessness and despair.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations described.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""take myself out"" explicitly indicates suicide/ending life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No methods (tools, substances) mentioned.
   - No preparations described.
   - Fear of pain (""scared it'll be painful"") implies lack of concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current feelings/desires (""want to take myself out""), not past actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post contains explicit mentions of suicide, such as ""thought about killing myself"" and ""So many people commit suicide."" It expresses strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I hate every single day,"" ""My life is ruined"") and references to preparations for suicide, specifically ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" and concern about not ""wuss[ing] out."" There are no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) described, and no references to past suicide attempts—only ongoing thoughts (""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""thought about killing myself""). There are direct expressions of a desire to die, indicating suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are not mentioned (no tools, substances, etc.), but there are signs of preparation: sending emails to parents before ""do[ing] it"" is akin to a suicide note, which is an explicit preparation per the category definition. This goes beyond mere thoughts and indicates behavioral steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (e.g., ""before I do it"") and references ongoing thoughts for the past 5 years. There is no description of past suicide attempts—only ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'indicator'. The mention of preparing emails (a suicide note equivalent) constitutes a specific preparation, aligning with 'behavior'. Although no method is detailed, the brief reference to a plan (sending emails before acting) meets the 'behavior' threshold. Since preparations are explicit, 'ideation' is not appropriate, and 'attempt' does not apply as there are no past actions described. The rules state that if unsure about planning, choose 'ideation', but here the preparation is clear, so 'behavior' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""Ending it soon,"" which refers to suicide. It expresses emotional distress with phrases like ""I'm so fucking depressed,"" fear about the virus killing their mom, job loss, and hopelessness from a bad trip. There is a specific plan involving dextromethorphan, with details on ordering 14 grams and intending to take it all upon arrival. No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through ""Ending it soon,"" which directly indicates a desire to die. This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method is mentioned: using dextromethorphan (a substance that can be lethal in high doses) to overdose. Preparation is evident from ordering the drug and planning to consume it all when it arrives. This indicates explicit planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current and future intentions (""Ending it soon,"" ""taking it all as soon as it gets here""), not past events. No history of attempts is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicide and desire to die supports at least 'ideation'. However, the specific method (dextromethorphan) and preparations (ordering it) align with the 'behavior' category, which requires a plan. Since the plan is explicit and involves acquiring means, 'behavior' is the best fit. Rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if unsure about planning, but here the planning is clear.

So basically,I ""really lived"" 15 years , and it wasn't really good , so you guys are telling me I have to live 60 years more, so about 5times what I already lived? When did Human thought it would be cool living so much?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses general hopelessness and dissatisfaction with life, questioning the value of living (""how people can want to live?"", ""it wasn't really good""). It mentions the concept of death in a statistical context (""Human tend to die around 80"") and personal dread about the future (""I have 60 fucking years left""). However, there are no explicit references to suicide, self-harm, death wishes, or specific plans. Emotional indicators include despair and frustration, but they are framed as rhetorical questions rather than direct expressions of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No).
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to die"" or ""I don't want to live""). The language is philosophical and questioning life's purpose, not personal desire for death. Since it's unclear, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The post discusses the abstract burden of a long life but lacks any concrete plans or behaviors related to self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings of dissatisfaction and future dread (""I have to live 60 years more""), not past events. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content aligns with the 'indicator' category because it lacks explicit suicidal expressions. It shows general distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life, but no direct mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. The rules state that even ""very large general dissatisfaction"" is 'indicator' when suicide isn't explicitly mentioned, and to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' in cases of doubt.

Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses ""passive suicidal"" individuals and ""suicide by cop"" as a concept, but these are general statements about hypothetical others, not personal expressions from the author.
   - There are no mentions of the author's own death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators like hopelessness are implied in the hypothetical scenario, but not directly attributed to the author.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are made by the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicide by cop""), but this refers to a general behavior in others, not the author. The author does not express any personal desire to die or not be alive. Leaning toward 'indicator' since the suicide mentions are not self-referential.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific method (""suicide by cop"") is described, but it is attributed to hypothetical others, not the author. There are no signs of personal preparation or planning by the author. Since this is not about the author, it does not indicate behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post is a general commentary with no reference to past, current, or future personal events involving the author. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors from the author. It contains general discussion about suicide risk in others, which falls under vague or indirect references. According to the rules, suicide risk must correspond to the author, and when in doubt about explicit self-mention, choose 'indicator'. Thus, 'indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""think that might be the way I choose to go"" (explicit desire to die).  
   - Refers to a specific method: using an insulin pump to overdose (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"").  
   - Notes accessibility/ease of the method (""easiest and most accessible"").  
   - Describes past thoughts (""Thought about doing it a couple times"") but no past *actions* (dismissed as a ""hassle"").  
   - Emotional indicators: depression, feeling like a burden.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""choose to go"" implies ending life).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" and expresses a current desire to do so (""well I do and I have a chance right now""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""tired of everything"") and despair (""nobody told me happy birthday... they just walked past me like I was nothing"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to weapons, notes, or substances).
   - No references to past suicide attempts; the content focuses on current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill yourself"").
   - Yes, there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""ever wanted to kill yourself... well I do"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are described. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" is vague and does not indicate a concrete plan, method, or actionable steps.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""right now""), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but lacks any specific plan or method, ruling out ""behavior"". 
   - There is no description of past actions, ruling out ""attempt"". 
   - Due to the explicit suicide mentions, it does not fit ""indicator"". 
   - Therefore, it aligns with ""ideation"" (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan).

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses significant distress about academic pressures, feelings of isolation, and hopelessness. Key phrases include: ""I don't want to do this anymore,"" ""it's so hard,"" and crucially, ""I'm finally considering suicide."" There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. References to ""crying myself to sleep"" and emotional breakdowns indicate despair but no self-harm actions. The phrase ""We all die right?"" reflects nihilism but not an active plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **Yes**. The statement ""I'm finally considering suicide"" is an explicit, first-person acknowledgment of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **No specific plan or method**. No details about how, when, or where suicide might occur. No mention of acquiring means (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparatory steps (e.g., writing a note).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to **current** suicidal ideation (""finally considering suicide"") with no description of past attempts or behaviors. Mentions historical mental health struggles but not past suicide actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is present (""considering suicide""), ruling out *indicator*.  
   - No plan, method, or preparatory behavior described, ruling out *behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""attempted to end my life"", ""kill myself"", ""almost committed"".
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""Living life as a shell""), hopelessness (""I'm too much of a pussy""), and intense distress (""shaking and bawling"").
   - Specific methods/preparations: Use of a knife, self-inflicted bleeding on wrists/thighs.
   - References to past attempts: ""I just attempted"" (recent action) and detailed description of the act (holding knife, physical harm).
   - Temporal context: Focuses on a recent attempt (""just attempted"") and its immediate aftermath.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" ""committed"" (suicide).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific method: Knife, with evidence of action (bleeding wrists/thighs). Preparation is evident (holding knife, self-harm).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to a recent attempt (""just attempted"") and describes it in detail (past action).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post describes a concrete past suicide attempt (using a knife, causing injury). This meets the ""Attempt"" definition: *""describes past attempts at suicide""* and *""a concrete action need to have happened""*. Mentions of current despair (""I can’t even kill myself"") don’t override the primary focus on the recent attempt.  
   - *Not ""Behavior""*: While methods are mentioned, they are part of a described attempt, not just planning.  
   - *Not ""Ideation"" or ""Indicator""*: Explicit suicide intent and a described action rule these out.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to,"" ""when I do [talk to them] I feel like killing myself,"" ""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no point to [life]""), isolation, family conflict, and despair are present.
   - Plans/methods: No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. The user states attempting is ""harder than I want it to be"" and lacks ""guts,"" implying no actionable plan.
   - Past attempts: Explicitly denied (""I've never actually attempted"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Direct expressions include ""wanting to [commit suicide]"" and ""feel like killing myself.""

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire meets the threshold for **ideation**. No plan/preparation rules out ""behavior,"" and absence of past attempts rules out ""attempt."" General distress alone would be ""indicator,"" but explicit suicidal intent elevates it to ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""plan to kill myself,"" indicating suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include frustration and anger (""snitched,"" ""what the fuck"") and a sense of helplessness through the euthanasia analogy. No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. There are no references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - The word ""plan"" is mentioned, but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are detailed. Since the plan is not explicit, this falls under uncertainty, so 'ideation' is preferred over 'behavior' based on the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The plan is referenced as something that was disclosed (""snitched on me""), but there is no indication it is a past attempt or current action. The focus is on the aftermath (family watching), not on describing a completed suicide attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") and a general reference to a plan, but without specifics. According to the definitions, this aligns with 'ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). The rules state to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' when uncertain about explicit planning, and there is no evidence of past attempts for 'attempt'. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to the explicit suicide mention.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post contains explicit statements: ""im gonna kill myself"" and sets a specific timeframe (""3 weeks from now""). It mentions social withdrawal (""minimally interact with everyone except the kids"") and concern for a child's safety (""I hope my baby ends up safe"").  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: A timeframe (""3 weeks from now"") is specified, but no methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. The social withdrawal is behavioral but not inherently preparatory for suicide.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to a future intention (""gonna kill myself... 3 weeks from now""). No past attempts are described.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent confirms it is not ""indicator"".  
   - No specific method/preparation mentioned (e.g., pills, weapons, notes), so it does not meet ""behavior"" criteria.  
   - The timeframe alone does not constitute a plan; rules state ""behavior"" requires explicit methods/preparations.  
   - Absence of past actions rules out ""attempt"".  
   → Falls under **ideation** (explicit desire to die with temporal intent but no actionable plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post lists specific lethal substances (Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) in quantities that suggest a potential overdose. The question ""Would this kill me"" directly ties the substances to a fatal outcome. There is no explicit emotional language (e.g., hopelessness), but the query implies intent to die.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Suicide is not explicitly stated (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""), but the phrase ""Would this kill me"" combined with lethal means indicates a clear desire to end life.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Specific methods (overdosing on Midol, Prozac, Tylenol, alcohol) and exact quantities (""3 bottles,"" ""30 pills,"" ""bottle"") are provided, indicating concrete planning and preparation.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post discusses a hypothetical future action (""Would this kill me""), not a past attempt.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The explicit detailing of lethal methods/quantities qualifies as **behavior** (suicidal planning). While the phrasing is a question, the specificity of means/preparation overrides ambiguity.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and ""end it,"" indicating a desire to die. It discusses emotional concerns about affecting loved ones but reveals current suicidal planning. Specific methods like ""car accident or something"" are mentioned to disguise the suicide. There are no references to past attempts; the focus is on future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide"" and ""end it""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die (""I'll get what I want""). This is clear, so it cannot be 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""car accident or something"" as a way to make the suicide appear accidental. This constitutes a ""specific idea of how to commit suicide"" (methods/means). Although no explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described, the method is outlined, meeting the 'behavior' criteria. Since the method is specified, it is not 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""planning,"" ""recently I've been thinking""). There is no mention of past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**

The specific method (""car accident"") moves this beyond 'ideation' to 'behavior', as per the definition: ""mentions a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior"" and ""contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide."" There is no uncertainty here, so 'behavior' is appropriate. No past attempts are described, ruling out 'attempt'.

396,I'm a complete lost cause and nothing I do can change it. All I have ever done since I got back from uni was become constantly stuck. I've never had any skills that are useful to anyone. My family are giving up on me my dad hardly talks to me and I'm a constant burden on my sister and I'll never be able to help my mum in anyway. Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family. Hell I booked driving lesson but me being mentally dumb picked an expensive instructor and all it did was make my sister more stressed than she already was. She's right I'm a lost cause and I'm always going to fail everything I want to do,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""complete lost cause"", ""always going to fail""), worthlessness (""constant burden""), and perceived failure in multiple life areas (career, family, driving lessons). No explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations are present. Mentions of ""attempts"" refer to failed life improvements, not self-harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. Terms like ""lost cause"" imply distress but not suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: Absent. No tools, locations, preparations, or methods related to self-harm are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current/persistent struggles and past failures (e.g., job applications, driving lessons). No references to past suicide attempts or future plans for self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks explicit suicidal expressions, plans, or references to attempts. Falls under ""indicator"" due to the absence of direct suicidal ideation or behavior.

I feel like shit and I need to vent about it or just talk to someone about random basic things to feel a little less alone and depressed right now. To at least pretend that I have a friend. If you want to, PM me please. I'm 21, I'm not malicious I'm just fucking sad.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses feelings of sadness, loneliness, and depression (""I feel like shit,"" ""feel a little less alone and depressed,"" ""I'm just fucking sad"").
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include distress and a desire for connection to alleviate negative feelings, but no explicit hopelessness or despair about life itself.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No).
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (No).
   - Since it is unclear if there is any suicidal intent, the guidance is to lean toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations are described.
   - With no suicidal thoughts expressed, this step does not apply to 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings (""right now""), with no reference to past events or future intentions related to suicide.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and sadness but lacks any explicit mention of suicidal thoughts, plans, or past attempts.
   - According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there is no direct or explicit reference to suicide, only emotional distress. The presence of depression and loneliness does not escalate to 'ideation' without an expressed desire to die.

398,"I wrote a note today. I've been struggling with this my whole life. But always I felt that there was some light at the end of the tunnel if only i could just get to it. Lately It seems like that light has disappeared. I have severe anxiety on top of everything else so any friends I had are long gone or cut me out of their life's because they couldn't handle helping me with my stuff. I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try. Instead I end up in the ER all night followed by a transport to a different type of hospital. I was out of there within two hours. I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of. I just don't know how much longer I can keep going like this. Even my fear of non existence after death doesn't seem to deter me any more. I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions writing a note (""I wrote a note today""), which aligns with suicide note preparation.
   - Expresses extreme hopelessness (""light has disappeared,"" ""end of my rope,"" ""can't keep going""), despair, and isolation.
   - References failed help-seeking (ER visit, ineffective treatments) and feeling trapped.
   - Explicitly states fear of death no longer deters them, implying increased risk tolerance.
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die."" Indirect expressions of inability to continue (""can't keep going"") suggest ideation but lack explicit suicidal language. Leaning toward ""indicator"" per rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - ""Wrote a note"" is a recognized preparation step (suicide note) per the ""behavior"" definition, even without method details. This overrides indirect language.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The note was written ""today"" (current preparation). Past events (ER visit, treatments) are not described as suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The suicide note preparation qualifies as ""behavior,"" despite no explicit method. Hopelessness alone would be ""indicator,"" but concrete preparation shifts it to ""behavior"" per rules.

399,Tried didn't work. Tried to end my life again. Didn't work.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit references to suicide: ""Tried to end my life again"" directly indicates an attempt to die by suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration or hopelessness from ""Didn't work,"" but the key focus is on actions taken.
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or steps described).
   - There is a clear reference to past attempts: ""Tried didn't work"" and ""Tried to end my life again"" explicitly describe previous unsuccessful suicide actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""end my life,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to die.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are described for any current or future plan. The post only recounts past actions without detailing how the attempts were made.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers entirely to past events (""tried,"" ""didn't work,"" ""again""), with no indication of current or future intentions. It specifically describes multiple past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes concrete past actions (attempts to end life) that were unsuccessful, fitting the ""Attempt"" category definition: ""The content describes past attempts at suicide... A concrete action need to have happened in the past."" 
   - It does not fit ""Behavior"" because no current plan or preparation is mentioned. It goes beyond ""Ideation"" due to the explicit description of actions taken. It cannot be ""Indicator"" because suicide is explicitly referenced.

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post details a long medical history following a fall, with persistent symptoms and failed treatments. 
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""nothing has helped me"") and explicit hopelessness (""I feel hopeless""). 
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""I deserve to die,"" ""I deserve a fucking bullet in my head,"" ""I wish someone would... slit my fucking throat.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""there is no better""), self-loathing (""I'm a self-absorbed whiny piece of shit""), worthlessness (""I don't deserve to get better"").
   - No specific personal plans or preparations (user states: ""I have no plans"").
   - No references to past attempts.
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes** (""deserve to die,"" ""bullet in my head,"" ""slit my throat"" are explicit expressions of wanting to die).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Methods mentioned (""bullet,"" ""slit throat"") but framed as wishes (""I wish someone would"") rather than personal intent or preparation. User explicitly states ""I have no plans.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current feelings, no past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire qualifies for 'ideation' or 'behavior,' but the absence of personal planning/preparation and explicit denial of plans (""I have no plans"") rules out 'behavior.' No past actions indicate 'attempt.' Graphic language does not override the lack of personal intent to act; thus, 'ideation' fits best per rules (choose 'ideation' if uncertain about planning).

   - Focuses on **future intent** (""the second they're gone, so am I""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses avoiding disclosure of suicidal thoughts in therapy due to fear of stress and intrusive questioning. It explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but frames them as something the user lies about. There is no mention of death, dying, or self-harm beyond the reference to thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself""), but this is metaphorical. No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""suicidal thoughts,"" which directly references suicidal ideation. However, the user does not express a current desire to die or not be alive; instead, they discuss concealing these thoughts. Since the term ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicit, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on the avoidance of discussing thoughts, not on planning or acting on them.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to general or past suicidal thoughts in the context of therapy questionnaires, not current or future intentions. The phrase ""if I've had suicidal thoughts"" suggests reflection on past experiences. There is no description of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" qualifies as an expression of suicidal ideation under the definition, as it indicates a desire related to not being alive, even if not currently expressed. There is no specific plan or method, ruling out 'behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'attempt'. The metaphorical language about a ""grave"" indicates distress but, on its own, would be 'indicator'; however, combined with the explicit reference to suicidal thoughts, the post meets the criteria for 'ideation'. Since the content includes explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan, 'ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes ""nearly killing myself,"" which references suicide, and ""I fucking hate living,"" which expresses a desire not to be alive. ""Shooting up the school"" could imply harm to others, but the suicide risk focus is on the author (""killing myself"").
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair and hopelessness are present (e.g., ""rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" ""what the fuck did I do wrong?"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The reference to ""shooting up the school"" is tied to a past event and is not a current or future plan.
   - References to past attempts: ""Nearly killing myself"" describes a past situation involving serious suicidal consideration but not a concrete attempt (as ""nearly"" implies no actual action occurred).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""killing myself"").
   - There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""I fucking hate living"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific methods or preparations for current suicide are mentioned. The past reference to ""shooting up the school"" is historical and not indicative of current planning. Without evidence of explicit current planning, this does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post refers to a past event (""nearly killing myself"") but focuses on current feelings (""I fucking hate living""). ""Nearly killing myself"" does not describe a concrete past attempt (as per rules, mere thoughts or near-events without action are not 'attempt'). Current expressions of suicidal thoughts are present.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""killing myself,"" ""I fucking hate living"") without any current plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which includes explicit desires to die without a specific plan. The past reference (""nearly killing myself"") is not a described attempt and does not override the current ideation. No evidence of behavior or attempt based on the rules.

Sometimes all these thoughts just pop up and then I feel bad asking my boyfriend and saying these things because he's trying to heal,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly describes a past overdose event: ""Survived OD"" and details of swallowing ""120+ pills of ibuprofen"" while drinking ""hard liquor from the bottle."" This indicates a self-harm action with lethal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of stupidity, confusion (""why do I feel like that""), and ongoing distress (""still processing everything"").
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ibuprofen pills and alcohol as means for the overdose.
   - References to past attempts are clear: ""Survived OD"" and the detailed account of the overdose event confirm a concrete past action.
   - There is no indication of current or future plans; the focus is on reflecting on the past event.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly referenced through the phrase ""you can't kill yourself with ibuprofen"" (quoting the mother) and the user's statement ""I wanted to"" die, which is directly tied to the overdose.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are described (ibuprofen and alcohol), but this is in the context of a past attempt, not a current plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The entire post centers on a past suicide attempt (e.g., ""Survived OD,"" ""When I sat there and swallowed...""). Current elements like ""thoughts just pop up"" refer to processing the past event, not active planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt, with explicit details of the action taken (overdose) and survival. This fits the 'Attempt' category, defined as content focused on historic actions. The mention of current thoughts (""all these thoughts just pop up"") does not constitute a current plan, and the rule specifies that past attempts take precedence, even with current ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""I feel totally helpless and misunderstood""), despair (""the world is just so rotten to me""), and malice perceived in others (""Every action is malicious""). Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the final sentence: ""Suicide has become my quick solution."" There are no references to specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past suicide attempts. The user describes sharing feelings with others but receiving unhelpful responses, which reinforces their distress.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""Suicide has become my quick solution"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: The phrase ""quick solution"" implies a desire to escape life, but it is not a direct statement like ""I want to die."" However, the explicit mention of suicide means this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods are mentioned (e.g., no references to tools, locations, or substances).
   - No signs of preparation are indicated (e.g., no discussion of notes, acquiring means, or imminent actions).
   - Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the category should lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""has become"" in ""Suicide has become my quick solution"" suggests present ideation). There are no references to past suicide attempts—only past conversations about emotions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicide rules out 'indicator'. The absence of a specific plan or method means it does not qualify as 'behavior'. With no description of past attempts, 'attempt' is not applicable. The expression of suicidal thoughts without a concrete plan aligns with 'ideation' (explicit desires to end life but no specific plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses depression, daily struggles, feelings of isolation, and the persistent nature of mental illness. Key phrases include ""hard to keep going,"" ""hearing the voice in death stranding '*keep on keeping on*',"" feeling ""psychically mangled,"" and questioning the existence of a ""long-term cure."" There are **no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts**. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""never really goes away"") and despair, but these remain generalized.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **No**. The post lacks direct expressions like ""I want to die,"" ""suicide,"" or ""end my life."" The Death Stranding reference is metaphorical (a game about perseverance) and not a literal death wish.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **None**. No tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions are described.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on ongoing struggles, **not past attempts or future intentions**.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: While the post expresses significant distress and hopelessness, it stays within **general dissatisfaction with life** without crossing into explicit suicidal ideation. Per the rules:  
   - Vague references to death (e.g., the game quote) without explicit suicide intent fit ""indicator.""  
   - Hopelessness alone is insufficient for ""ideation"" without a stated desire to die.  
   - No ambiguity requiring escalation to ""ideation"" (per rule: ""When in doubt... choose 'indicator'"").

I'm 18 and my dad died when I was around 2 but I was never really told what happened or ever even seen his grave, finding out he committed suicide just makes it seem like it's inevitable for me and I can'tstop thinking about it. ive felt like shit for years now I feel like I'm reliving the same day everyday, I've even begun skipping classes it just takes so much energy, I get suicidal thoughts but im probably toouch of a pussy to ever do it. I keep saying to myself I'll see a doctor but deep down I know that's not true.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The user references their father's suicide, but this is about someone else. For themselves, they explicitly state ""I get suicidal thoughts,"" indicating personal suicidal ideation. They also express hopelessness (""it seems like it's inevitable for me"") and despair (""I've felt like shit for years,"" ""reliving the same day"").
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness and distress are present, but the key personal risk element is the explicit suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans or methods: No mention of any plan, method, preparation, or tools for suicide. The user adds, ""im probably too much of a pussy to ever do it,"" suggesting no intent or action.
   - Past attempts: No description of any past suicide attempts by the user. Only the father's suicide is mentioned, which is irrelevant to the user's current risk.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned for the user: ""I get suicidal thoughts"" is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, indicating a desire not to be alive. This is clear and explicit, so it leans toward 'ideation' over 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The user's self-doubt about acting (""too much of a pussy to ever do it"") reinforces the absence of a plan. Since there is uncertainty about planning, the rule is to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The suicidal thoughts are described in the present tense (""I get suicidal thoughts""), indicating current ideation. There are no references to past attempts by the user.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" without any plan or method aligns with the 'ideation' category (explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan). The distress and hopelessness support this but do not elevate it to 'behavior' due to the lack of planning. It is not 'attempt' as there are no past attempts described, and not 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned for the user.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""i wanna off myself, obviously"" and ""if i killed myself"" directly express a desire to die.

   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (supports **ideation** or higher).  
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out **behavior**.  
   - No description of past actions rules out **attempt**.  
   - Vague hopelessness alone would be ""indicator,"" but explicit suicidal intent elevates to **ideation**.

I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>

   - References to the user's past actions include: ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""cut your wrists again,"" and vomiting food (suggesting an eating disorder).  
   - Emotional context includes extreme hostility, invalidation of the user's depression, and blame.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific methods are referenced (gun, shooting, cutting wrists), but these are *suggested by the parents*, not stated as the user's own plan or preparation.  
   - The user's **past actions** are described: prior suicide attempts (""try to kill yourself again"") and self-harm (""cut your wrists again"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is the parents' descriptions of the user's **past suicide attempts** and self-harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with phrases like ""kill yourself"" and ""a way to Kim's"" (which appears to be a typo for ""kill myself"" based on context). It expresses a desire to die and seeks information on methods to commit suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration, hopelessness, and a direct request for a ""least painful way,"" indicating a strong intent to end life.
   - There is an inquiry about methods (""least painful way to kill yourself""), but no specific method, plan, location, or preparation is described (e.g., no mention of tools, substances, or actions taken).
   - No references to past attempts or events are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""kill yourself"").
   - Yes, there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""I just need a way to Kim's"" interpreted as ""kill myself"").
   - This rules out 'indicator' as the expressions are explicit.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - The user asks about methods but does not state a specific method, tool, location, or preparation. This is a general inquiry about ""least painful ways,"" not an explicit plan.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned.
   - Since no explicit plan is described, and based on the rule to choose 'ideation' over 'behavior' if uncertain about planning, this leans toward 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (seeking a way to die now), not past events.
   - No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which includes explicit expressions of suicidal feelings without a concrete plan. The query about methods indicates ideation but does not constitute a plan under the 'behavior' definition.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""write a suicidal note,"" which explicitly references suicide preparation. It also describes intense emotional distress with ""my stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside,"" indicating hopelessness or despair. The word ""again"" suggests past instances of similar behavior, but no specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations) are described, and no past suicide attempts are detailed.
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""suicidal note,"" confirming a direct reference to suicide. There is no explicit expression like ""I want to die,"" but ""suicidal note"" is an explicit indicator of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific preparation is mentioned: writing a suicide note. This is listed as an example of preparation under the behavior category definition. No methods (e.g., tools, substances) or locations are specified, but the note itself is a recognized preparatory step.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current/future intentions (""I think I'm going to write"") with a reference to past behavior (""again""). However, it does not describe a past suicide attempt (e.g., an actual act to end life), only past note-writing. The primary context is current preparation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of suicide via ""suicidal note"" rules out the indicator category.
   - While there is an expression of suicidal thoughts, the specific preparation (writing a suicide note) moves this beyond ideation. The behavior category explicitly includes preparations like a suicide note, even if no method is detailed.
   - This does not fit the attempt category, as no past suicide attempt is described; only preparatory actions are referenced.
   - Therefore, based on the behavior definition (preparations taken, e.g., suicide note), this post best fits the behavior category.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present (""slaying myself""), but no plan or preparation is described. This fits **ideation** (explicit desire to die without a specific plan).  
   - ""Committing a massacre"" implies harm to others but is irrelevant per rules (focus only on the writer's suicide risk).

I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

I just try to get through the day in hope my breathing will get back to normal. The doctors i go to dont really help. I feel so helpless, angry and sad. If my breathing doesnt go back to normal I cant see myself having a life worthliving. I wish there would be a God that could intervene and help. Sadly nothing happens for a higher reason. So much horrible things happen to so manny innocent people for no reason and just by bad luck. I hate this world. I hate how this world works. I hate the people in my country. My life wasnt good before getting sick, but now, it has become unbearable.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life due to long-term health issues (breathing problems from Covid), unemployment, and social isolation. Key phrases include ""my life isnt worth living anymore,"" ""I can't see myself having a life worthliving,"" and descriptions of unbearable suffering. No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit statements about suicide or wanting to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I wish I were dead""). The phrase ""life isn't worth living"" implies despair but does not explicitly express suicidal intent.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current suffering and future hopelessness (""if my breathing doesn't go back to normal""), with no reference to past suicide attempts.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows severe hopelessness and distress but lacks explicit suicidal expressions, plans, or references to attempts. Per the rules, vague expressions of life not being worth living fall under ""indicator"" when suicide is not explicitly mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""kill myself"" and ""I'll be gone"" directly reference suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""don't see the point anymore"").  
   - Specific plans/preparations: Mentions a timeline (""by February"") but no methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no notes, weapons, or substances).  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Kill myself"" is an explicit expression of wanting to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method**: While a timeframe (""by February"") is stated, there is no mention of *how* the user plans to act (e.g., tools, locations, or preparations).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **future intentions** (""going to kill myself soon""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, aligning with **ideation**.  
   - Absence of methods/preparations rules out **behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions death/dying/suicide: ""want to die,"" ""gonna end my life.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""too many problems,"" ""fucked up person"").
   - Specific plans/preparations: ""gonna end my life this month"" implies intent but lacks explicit methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means).
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""end my life"" and ""want to die"" are direct expressions of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. The timeframe (""this month"") suggests intent but falls short of explicit planning (e.g., ""using a gun"" or ""jumping from a bridge""). Uncertainty leans toward 'ideation' per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on future intentions (""gonna end""), not past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire qualifies as 'ideation'. Absence of concrete plans/preparations rules out 'behavior'. No past actions indicate 'attempt'. Vague timeframe alone doesn't constitute a plan.

I got called pessimistic and it's because I'm suffering I mean yes my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs helped me to understood the world and better solutions I got hate for being realistic and honest yes ofc. If you are mental ill or suicidal and still want kids go for it I won't judge, you may be a good parent",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicidal thoughs"" (likely a typo for ""thoughts""), which is an explicit reference to suicide. It also includes emotional indicators like suffering, mental illnesses, pessimism, and hopelessness about the world. However, there are no specific plans, methods, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or references to past suicide attempts. The author discusses their mental state but does not describe any actions or intentions beyond having thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through the phrase ""suicidal thoughs."" This is a direct expression of suicidal thoughts, indicating a desire related to not wanting to be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The reference to suicidal thoughts lacks any detail on how, when, or where suicide might be carried out. Since there is no evidence of planning, this points away from 'behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The suicidal thoughts are described in a general or ongoing context (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughs""), not tied to a specific past event. There are no mentions of past attempts, so this does not qualify as 'attempt.'

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughs"" places this beyond 'indicator,' as it directly expresses suicidal ideation. However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior.' There is also no description of past suicide actions, ruling out 'attempt.' Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation,' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan.

424,"As much as I hate it, suicide genuinely seems like the only solution. I feel like I've tried everything at this point. It just feels like nothings gonna work.

I'm done being this sad fucked up person. If I kill myself it'll be on my birthday, giving me plenty of time to plan it out. It feels like only viable solution",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution"", ""If I kill myself"", ""only viable solution"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothings gonna work"", ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life"") and despair (""I'm done being this sad fucked up person"").
   - There is a reference to a future time (""on my birthday"") and planning (""giving me plenty of time to plan it out""), but no specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described.
   - No past suicide attempts are mentioned; the hospital consideration is about seeking help, not an attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""suicide"", ""kill myself""), and there are direct expressions of wanting to die (e.g., ""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution""). This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While a future time (birthday) is specified for potential action, no explicit method, tools, locations, or immediate preparations are detailed. The phrase ""plan it out"" is vague and does not constitute a specific plan. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the rule states to lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions, not past events. There are no references to past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content expresses a strong desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, but without a concrete plan or method. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which includes explicit expressions of wanting to end one's life without specific plans. It does not meet the threshold for 'behavior' due to the lack of explicit planning details, and 'attempt' is not applicable as no past actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense feelings of worthlessness (""I'm a failure"", ""Burden on my family""), hopelessness (""all I deserve is pain and loneliness""), and isolation (""fighting this battle alone"").  
   - Explicitly states suicidal ideation: ""I've been thinking of ending it all"".  
   - No references to specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  
   - No description of past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:

I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The post includes phrases like ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend,"" and ""my death will be following very soon,"" which strongly imply suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators: There is hopelessness and guilt (e.g., feeling sorry for the mother), but the focus is on action.
   - Specific plans or preparations: The user explicitly mentions ""attempt this weekend"" (indicating a timeframe) and discusses preparing a will (""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents""), which is a concrete step in planning for death.
   - References to past attempts: None; all references are to future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but phrases like ""attempt this weekend"" and ""my death will be following very soon"" are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive. Given the context, this leans toward explicit intent, so it exceeds 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are mentioned, but there is a clear timeframe (""this weekend"") and explicit preparation (creating a will). This constitutes planning behavior, as the will is a preparation step directly tied to impending death.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to future intentions (""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"") and preparations, not past events. There are no descriptions of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to end life) and mentions preparations (will), which fits the 'behavior' category. It does not describe a past attempt (so not 'attempt'), and the presence of planning rules out 'ideation'. While the word ""suicide"" isn't used, the intent is clear, and preparations elevate it beyond 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicit references to living/dying (""whether or not I'll live till October,"" ""cannot live if I fail""), methods (jumping, overdosing via meds, cutting with blades), and barriers to acting (no access to meds, no location, ineffective tools).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I really cannot live if I fail""), ambivalence (""not like I wanna live either""), but also temporary hope (""almost happy,"" ""decent place"").  
   - Plans/preparations: Discusses specific methods (jumping, blades, meds) but explicitly states inability to act due to lack of means/access. No active preparation described.  
   - Past attempts: References past self-harm (""blades I used to cut"") but no explicit mention of past suicide attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct expressions like ""whether or not I'll live"" and ""cannot live if I fail"" explicitly tie survival to an external event, indicating active suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods are mentioned (jumping, blades, meds), but the writer emphasizes current inability to act (""no access,"" ""no place,"" ""blades won't go deep""). No active planning or preparation is described; barriers prevent execution.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future contingency (""if I fail"" the test) and current state (barriers to acting). Past self-harm is noted, but no past suicide attempts are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (ideation), and methods are specified. However, the writer details concrete barriers preventing action and concludes with uncertainty about future capability (""don’t even know how I’ll do it""). Rules state: If uncertain about explicit planning, choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'. Here, methods are acknowledged but explicitly non-actionable, aligning with **ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep hopelessness, despair, and disillusionment with life systems (school, work, family). Key elements include feeling drained of motivation, perceiving efforts as useless, losing the will to strive, and feeling trapped in an exploitative cycle.

   - Emotional indicators: ""depression, fear, regret and worthlessness"", ""net gain for the world if I die"", ""I fucking hate myself"", ""I'm sad"", ""I want help"".
   - Specific methods: Slitting wrists, shooting with a gun, cutting. Preparations implied through isolation (""body wouldn't be found"", ""cut off enough"").

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself"" (direct expression), ""wanted to do this for over a decade"" (persistent desire).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""i'm not cut out for life,"" ""can't even imagine mine being worth living"" (hopelessness).  
   - Plans/preparations: ""the day i chose is very soon"" (timing) but **no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** described.  
   - Past attempts: Not mentioned.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself"").  
   - Yes (""wanted to do this for over a decade"").  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, tools, or preparations. Timing (""very soon"") implies intent but lacks actionable details.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""day i chose is very soon"").  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method qualifies as ""behavior."" Timing alone is insufficient without concrete details. Falls under **ideation** (explicit wish to die without specific plan).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""suicidal"" explicitly: ""This the most suicidal I've been In a couple months""
   - Expresses desire to end suffering: ""I Just want to be out of my misery""
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described
   - No references to past attempts or self-harm actions
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""cba anymore""), isolation (""Not going to contact anyone"")

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: Directly states feeling ""suicidal"" and wanting to ""be out of my misery""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods (tools/substances/locations)
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means)

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to current feelings (""most suicidal I've been... months"") with no past attempts described

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire confirms this exceeds 'indicator'
   - Absence of specific plans/preparations rules out 'behavior'
   - No description of past concrete actions rules out 'attempt'
   - Matches 'ideation': Explicit desire to end life without plans or methods

434,I just want to die. Why is it so hard to die. I just want to kill myself but I can't find a suitable way to go,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""die"" multiple times and ""kill myself,"" indicating direct expressions of suicidal thoughts.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration and hopelessness (e.g., ""Why is it so hard to die"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""can't find a suitable way to go"" suggests consideration of methods but no explicit plan.
   - No references to past attempts; the focus is on current feelings.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. (Yes)
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""I just want to die"" confirms a desire to not be alive. (Yes)

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) are identified. The user expresses difficulty finding a way but does not describe a concrete plan.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means). Since no explicit plan is present, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The language (""I just want"") indicates current intentions, not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself"") but no specific plan or preparation, fitting the 'ideation' definition. The absence of methods or behaviors rules out 'behavior'. No past actions are described, so 'attempt' does not apply. General distress is present, but the explicit suicide mention excludes 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes feelings of being at a ""low point,"" having zero social skills, low self-esteem, loneliness, and worries about developing language skills. It asks for advice on moving to another country. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or hopelessness beyond general dissatisfaction.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mentions of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No references to methods, tools, preparations, or locations related to self-harm/suicide.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current struggles and future uncertainties (moving countries), with no references to past attempts or self-harm actions.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The distress expressed is general and lacks explicit suicidal ideation, planning, or references to attempts. Mentions of a ""low point"" and loneliness are indicators of distress but do not meet the threshold for ""ideation.""

436,To the guy who reported my post which lead to my acc getting banned. I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains mentions of death (""I hope you die a horrible painful death ASAP""), but this is directed at another person (the reporter), not the writer themselves.
   - Emotional indicators include anger and hostility, but no expressions of hopelessness, despair, or personal distress from the writer.
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for self-harm or suicide by the writer are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicide attempts by the writer.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned; the death wish is about someone else.
   - There are no direct expressions from the writer about wanting to die or not be alive.
   - Since no suicidal intent is expressed by the writer, this leans toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No methods or plans for suicide by the writer are identified.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post references a past event (account being banned) but focuses on a current/future wish for harm to another person, not the writer's own suicidal intentions.
   - No past suicide attempts by the writer are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses anger and a death wish toward another individual, but it contains no explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors from the writer.
   - According to the rules, suicide risk must pertain only to the writer, not others mentioned. General dissatisfaction (like anger) without explicit suicidal content falls under 'indicator'.
   - The 'indicator' category includes general distress without direct mention of suicide, which fits here.

437,"I will kill my bullie. Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill  only yourself, but others. I have a problem, this women is bullying me and other people with her for couple of years now. I will kill her. I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post primarily discusses the author's intent to kill their bully, with statements like ""I will kill my bullie"" and ""I will kill her."" It includes a reference to a type of suicide that involves killing others (""for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), but this is a general comment, not a personal expression of suicidal intent. The author expresses anger and frustration toward the bully but no explicit personal desire for self-harm or suicide. There is no mention of the author wanting to die, specific suicide methods, preparations for suicide, or past suicide attempts. The focus is on homicide (killing the bully) to achieve peace, not on self-inflicted harm.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:
   - Suicide is mentioned indirectly in the context of a ""type of suicide"" involving killing others, but the author does not explicitly state a desire to die or commit suicide themselves. Phrases like ""I will kill her"" and ""live my life in peace"" indicate an intent to survive after the act. No direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive are present for the author. Since it's unclear if the suicide reference applies personally, lean toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The author seeks suggestions for how to murder the bully (e.g., ""how to murder her""), which relates to homicidal planning, not suicidal behavior. There are no mentions of suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, means for self-harm). The planning is entirely external, focused on another person.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:
   - The post discusses future intentions to kill the bully, with no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm by the author. The line ""I tried every possible thing to make her stop"" refers to efforts to stop bullying, not suicide-related actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors from the author. While it contains general distress and a passing reference to suicide in a third-person context, there is no indication that the author personally desires or plans suicide. The homicidal content does not fall under the suicide risk categories. Per the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned for the author, and there is doubt, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: Explicitly includes ""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""end it all.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair (""cannot do this anymore""), hopelessness (""disappointment and failure""), and distress due to mental health and college stress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: ""I know exactly what to do"" suggests awareness of a potential method, but no explicit details (e.g., tools, locations, substances) are provided.
   - References to past attempts: None present; all statements are current or future-oriented.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself""). Direct expressions of wanting to die are also clear (e.g., ""end it all""). Thus, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, drugs) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. ""I know exactly what to do"" implies intent but lacks explicit planning details. Since it is uncertain, the rule dictates choosing 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all""), with no reference to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., desire to die) but no explicit plan or method, fitting the 'ideation' definition. The vague implication of a plan (""know exactly what to do"") does not meet the threshold for 'behavior', which requires explicit details. No past attempts are mentioned, ruling out 'attempt'. Given the explicit suicidal expressions, it cannot be 'indicator'.

439,Someone kill me dude. I just wanna die you know,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains phrases like ""Someone kill me"" and ""I just wanna die,"" which explicitly mention death and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, but the key focus is on the explicit wish for death.
   - There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, or substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - No mention of past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but ""I just wanna die"" is a direct expression of wanting not to be alive, which qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought under the 'ideation' definition.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or plans are described. The statement is a general expression of wanting to die without details on how or when.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post expresses current feelings (""I just wanna die"") and does not refer to past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (desire to die) but lacks any plan or method. This fits the 'ideation' category, which covers explicit desires to end one's life without specific plans. It does not meet the criteria for 'behavior' (no plan), 'attempt' (no past action), or 'indicator' (the desire to die is explicit).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness, depression, and a desire to change fundamental aspects of identity (sexual orientation, gender dysphoria). It references past trauma (molestation) and chronic unhappiness. Key phrases include ""am tired of being unhappy,"" ""tired of being depressed,"" and pleas for divine intervention to remove negative feelings. No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, plans, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: **No**. The post focuses on emotional pain and a wish to ""be normal,"" but never explicitly states a desire to die, end life, or commit suicide.  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: **None**. No tools, locations, preparations, or methods related to self-harm/suicide are mentioned.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Refers to past experiences (e.g., molestation, lifelong unhappiness) but **no references to past or current suicidal actions**.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The distress, depression, and hopelessness align with general expressions of suffering. However, the absence of *any explicit suicidal desire, plan, or behavior* means it does not meet the threshold for ""ideation,"" ""behavior,"" or ""attempt."" Per rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned, classify as ""indicator.""

441,"Anyone suicidal from knee pain?. Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts. MRI says mild ACL sprain. But all the stretching in the world makes no difference. It's been 8 months, with no change in sight.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post includes the word ""suicidal"" in the question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"", but this is a general inquiry about others, not a direct statement from the writer about themselves. There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, or self-harm related to the writer.
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""Doesn't matter what you do, it hurts,"" ""no change in sight""), indicating distress about chronic pain.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of any suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations by the writer.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post discusses ongoing pain over 8 months but no history of suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned in the word ""suicidal,"" but it is used in a question directed at others (""Anyone suicidal...""), not as a direct expression of the writer's own thoughts or feelings. There are no statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I am suicidal"" from the writer. Since this is unclear and indirect, the analysis leans toward 'indicator' over 'ideation' as per the rules.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are described. The content focuses solely on the experience of pain and frustration.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to the current and ongoing situation (8 months of pain with no improvement), with no references to past suicide attempts or future intentions related to self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains general expressions of distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit, first-person expression of suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors by the writer. The question ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" does not constitute a personal expression of ideation; it is an indirect or general reference. According to the rules, when suicide is not explicitly mentioned in relation to the writer or when unclear, 'indicator' is chosen over 'ideation'. There is no evidence of behavior (planning) or attempt (past actions).
   - Therefore, based on the strict definitions, the post fits the 'indicator' category, which includes general distress without explicit suicidal content from the writer.

I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need. The damage that caused me has been irreparable. Fuck polyamory and open relationships too. I hate now this is normalized now.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: ""give in to the nothingness that is death,"" ""finally over,"" references someone who ""took their own life.""
   - Emotional indicators: ""destroyed me mentally,"" ""don't think I can go on much longer,"" ""road filled with pain,"" ""irreparable"" damage, ""over life,"" extreme hopelessness.
   - Plans/preparations: ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies intent but lacks specificity about method/timing.
   - Past attempts: None described by the author.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated (e.g., ""I will kill myself""). 
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes (""looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death""). 

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""looking forward to... death""). 
   - Past attempt by another person is referenced, but not by the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die pushes this beyond general distress (indicator). 
   - Absence of concrete plans/methods rules out behavior. 
   - No description of the author’s past suicide attempt. 
   - Strong suicidal ideation is present without actionable plans, fitting the ""ideation"" definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I want to die"" explicitly, indicating a desire to end life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and hurt from the mother's belittling behavior. There is no specific method, plan, or preparation described (e.g., ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" is vague and non-specific). No references to past attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly implied through ""I want to die,"" which is a direct expression of wanting to not be alive.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""wherever it is"" is ambiguous and does not constitute a plan, so it does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (""I want to die"") with no mention of past events or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression ""I want to die"" aligns with 'ideation' (suicidal thoughts without a plan). The vagueness of ""wherever it is"" does not indicate a specific plan, so 'ideation' is more appropriate than 'behavior'. It is not 'indicator' due to the explicit desire to die, and not 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses extreme hopelessness (""I can't do anything right"", ""I'm truly useless"") and explicitly mentions multiple suicide methods: starving oneself, hanging, and using a gun. It describes an active self-harm behavior (""I've started to try and starve myself"") and includes specific details about method preferences (slower starvation vs. quicker gun). References to heaven and seeing a deceased parent indicate preoccupation with death.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. Direct statements include:  
   - ""starve myself""

   - ""having access to a gun""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on current/future intentions (""started to try"", ""I'll be dead""). No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide and self-harm, such as ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck,"" ""I've been suicidal all my life,"" and descriptions of past actions like cutting wrists, laying on a road, and jumping in front of a train.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't go on like this""), despair, and references to trauma (e.g., rape, abuse).
   - Specific methods are mentioned: rope (hanging), cutting wrists, being run over, and jumping in front of a train. Preparations are indicated, like standing on a chair with a rope.
   - Past attempts are explicitly described: at age 11 (cutting wrists), 19 (laying on a road), and 24 (jumping in front of a train). The recent event with the rope is framed as a failed attempt (""Today I failed"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (e.g., ""suicidal,"" ""do it"" referring to suicide).
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die are present, such as ""I can't go on like this"" and ""I just can't pull myself together and just do it.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods are identified: rope for hanging, cutting wrists, etc. The recent event (""stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"") shows preparation and action.
   - A future plan is implied: ""I thought I could still grab some dinner and then do it.""

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post describes multiple past suicide attempts (ages 11, 19, 24).
   - It also references a recent, failed attempt (""I just stood on a chair..."" and ""Today I failed"") and current/future intentions (""do it"" after dinner).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and descriptions of past attempts, which align with the ""Attempt"" category (focused on historic actions).
   - Per the IMPORTANT RULES note: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" Here, past attempts are detailed, and current plans (e.g., ""do it"" after dinner) are mentioned, so ""Attempt"" applies.
   - Although current behavior (e.g., rope incident) is present, the rule prioritizes ""Attempt"" when past attempts and current plans coexist. The recent rope event is also described as a failed attempt, reinforcing the historic focus.

As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions discontinuing medical care (""stopped visiting the doctor's"") and passive acceptance of death (""if I die then I die,"" ""willing to accept when my time has come"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""future is really grim"") and devaluation of life (""not worth pushing my life further"").  
   - Explicitly states ""I don’t have any plans to end it.""  
   - No references to suicide methods, preparations, or past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - The post questions whether avoiding doctors is suicidal but never explicitly states a desire to die by suicide. Phrases like ""if I die then I die"" imply resignation, not active suicidal intent.  
   - **Answer**: No explicit mention of suicide or desire to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned. Avoiding doctors is a passive neglect, not an active plan.  
   - **Answer**: No plan identified.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes current feelings and behaviors (e.g., ongoing avoidance of doctors). No reference to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows hopelessness and risk-accepting behavior (neglecting health) but lacks explicit expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or methods. The statement ""no plans to end it"" directly rules out active intent. Passive acceptance of death aligns with the ""indicator"" category, which covers distress without explicit suicidal ideation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense self-hatred, depression, and feelings of worthlessness. Key elements include:  
   - Explicit mention: ""too much of a coward to **kill myself**"".  
   - Emotional indicators: ""hate myself"", ""depressed"", hopelessness about relationships/weight.  
   - No specific suicide methods, preparations, or timelines described.  
   - Starvation is mentioned in the context of weight loss, not as a suicide plan.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""kill myself"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotions/thoughts. No past attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") places this beyond *indicator*.  
   - Absence of methods/preparation rules out *behavior*. No past actions for *attempt*.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses helping a friend who is ""thinking about suicide"" but focuses on general advice (hugs, support) for assisting others. The author does not express personal distress, suicidal thoughts, self-harm, plans, or past attempts. Mentions of suicide are solely in the context of a hypothetical friend's struggles.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit expression from the **author** about wanting to die or not be alive. Suicide is mentioned only as a third-party reference.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No description of methods, preparations, or plans by the author. 
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: No references to the author's past or current suicidal actions or intentions.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The author shares general advice without personal expressions of suicidality. Mentions of suicide pertain to others, violating the rule to focus solely on the writer. The post lacks explicit suicidal ideation, planning, behavior, or attempts by the author, fitting the **indicator** category (general distress/sadness absent direct suicidal expression).

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""becoming content with that,"" ""drive me further to killing myself,"" and ""nature is telling me it's time to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no reason to live,"" ""waste of life""), isolation (""no one""), and despair (""end to me"").  
   - Methods/preparations: No specific plans, methods, locations, or tools described. Mentions stopping medication and drinking but not as a suicide method.  
   - Past attempts: None referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases include ""killing myself"" and ""suicide is their life's purpose.""

   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances for suicide), locations, or preparations described. Stopping medication/drinking is framed as coping, not suicide planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings/thoughts (""finally becoming content"") without references to past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire is present (ideation), but no actionable plan or preparation (behavior). References to medication/drinking lack suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide method: ""drowning yourself"" and detailed description of the process.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness implied by ""best option for me"" tied to a hypothetical trigger (getting kicked out).  
   - Specific method: Drowning in the ocean, framed as ""guaranteed death"" and ""peaceful.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" ""transition to death.""

We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements.

   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - No references to past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct statements like ""suicide is appropriate now"" and ""Death seems a better option"" explicitly express a desire to die/end life.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: While the post expresses a wish to escape life, it lacks any reference to concrete plans (e.g., means, timeline, or preparations).

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Emotional context is mixed; the user expresses hope due to Star Wars content, but the underlying discussion involves suicidal thoughts.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no mention of how, where, or when beyond a vague timeframe of ""next decade"").
   - There are no references to past attempts; the focus is on postponing future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned with phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts."" This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods or preparations are identified. The mention of ""suicide attempts"" is general and hypothetical, lacking details like means or plans. Since it's uncertain and vague, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to future intentions (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade"") with no indication of past actions. This is not 'attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit suicidal thoughts (desire not to be alive) but no concrete plan or behavior. This fits 'ideation' per the definition: expressions of suicidal feelings without specific plans. The vague reference to future ""attempts"" doesn't meet the threshold for 'behavior' due to lack of specificity.

I have no skills, no talents, nothing, I'm such a fucking worthless loser with nothing to contribute to this world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I just want to end it all,"" which implies a desire for death or suicide, and expresses strong hopelessness (e.g., ""no will to live anymore,"" ""tired of living,"" ""worthless loser"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, or notes).
   - No references to past suicide attempts; the focus is on current feelings and future dread (e.g., ""thought of having to trudge on for another 50-60 years"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly stated with words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it all"" is a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. This qualifies as an explicit suicidal thought under the ideation definition.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations are mentioned. The expression is general, lacking details on how the person would act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current and future intentions (e.g., despair about continuing life) with no indication of past actions or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to ""end it all"" and not be alive aligns with suicidal ideation, as there is no plan or behavior described. This rules out 'behavior' (no plan) and 'attempt' (no past actions). While hopelessness is present, the direct expression of wanting to die means it does not fit 'indicator,' which requires no explicit suicidal thoughts. Therefore, 'ideation' is the best fit.

   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide/self-harm: The post includes phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me,"" which are explicit references to death and a desire to die. There are emotional indicators of hopelessness (""There's no end to anything"") and despair (""back to feeling like shit,"" ""endless misery of depression"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or any preparations (e.g., no notes, means, or methods described).
   - References to past attempts: The phrase ""Feel like dying again"" suggests a recurrence of suicidal feelings but does not explicitly describe a past suicide attempt (e.g., no action like an overdose is mentioned). It indicates past ideation, not an actual attempt.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned using the word ""suicide,"" but there are direct expressions of wanting to die: ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" clearly convey a desire to not be alive. This is explicit enough for ideation per the category definition (e.g., ""a desire to not be alive any longer""). Since it is explicit, it is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. The content expresses a general desire to die without actionable details. Uncertainty about planning is not present, so 'ideation' is appropriate over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current feelings (e.g., ""Until now,"" ""I'm back to feeling like shit,"" ""Just kill me"") and a recurring pattern (""again""), but there is no description of past suicide attempts. The temporal focus is on present ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""Just kill me""), which aligns with the 'ideation' category definition: explicit suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as 'indicator' due to the direct desire expressed, nor 'behavior' due to the absence of planning, nor 'attempt' as no past actions are described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes extreme distress, including sleep deprivation (only one hour of sleep per night), feelings of persecution (landlord and neighbors conspiring against them), a recent MS diagnosis, financial helplessness (""I have no money to just walk out""), and existential despair (""I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me""). 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present, but they are framed around escaping the current situation (""I just wanna leave this place"") rather than ending life. 
   - No specific suicide plans, methods, preparations, or references to past attempts are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (No). 
   - There are no direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent). The desire to ""leave"" refers to the physical or situational context, not death. 
   - Since suicide is not mentioned, this leans strongly toward 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations for suicide are described. 
   - The post focuses on external stressors (e.g., landlord issues, sleep deprivation) without any indication of suicidal planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and ongoing situations (e.g., sleep issues, MS diagnosis), with no references to past suicide attempts or self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows severe distress and hopelessness but lacks any explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. 
   - According to the rules, 'indicator' includes general distress without explicit suicide mentions, and 'ideation' requires explicit expressions of wanting to die. Here, there is no suicidal intent, so 'indicator' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: The phrase ""Possible suicide date is in July"" explicitly references suicide and sets a potential timeframe. ""I'm fucking debating it"" directly refers to considering suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of hopelessness (""I have nobody"", ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope'"", ""I'll never be a real woman""), despair, and identity crisis (""I don't even know who I am anymore"").
   - Specific plans or preparations: A date (July) is mentioned, but no specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The use of ""possible"" and ""debating"" indicates uncertainty, not a concrete plan.
   - References to past attempts: None present; all content is current or future-oriented.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicide date""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive (""debating it"" refers to debating suicide).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, locations, substances) or explicit preparations are mentioned. The reference to a date suggests intent but lacks detail on how the suicide would be carried out. Due to the uncertainty (""possible"" and ""debating""), and the absence of method details, this does not constitute an explicit plan for behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post focuses on current feelings and future intentions (""suicide date is in July""). There is no description of past suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""suicide date"" and ""debating it""), which rules out ""indicator.""
   - No specific methods or preparations are described, so it does not meet the threshold for ""behavior.""
   - There are no references to past suicide actions, so ""attempt"" does not apply.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends. It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly uses the word ""suicidal"" and phrases like ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of hopelessness (""I will always be a loser who will never make friends"") and despair (""It hurts so much"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No mention of any methods, tools, locations, or preparations. The user explicitly states they ""probably never kill myself"" due to religious reasons, indicating no intent or plan to act.
   - References to past attempts: None; the post discusses current thoughts and feelings, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive: Yes (e.g., ""have suicidal thoughts"" and ""kill myself"" convey a desire to not be alive, albeit with a stated barrier).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) are mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described; instead, the user denies acting due to religious beliefs.
   - Uncertainty about planning: Since no plan is indicated and the user explicitly rules out action, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to current feelings and thoughts (e.g., ""Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts""), not past events. No description of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal ideation (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""kill myself"") without any mention of a plan, method, or preparation. The denial of action (""I will probably never kill myself"") reinforces the absence of intent or behavior. This aligns with the 'ideation' category, which covers explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. It does not qualify as 'behavior' due to the lack of planning, 'attempt' due to no past actions, or 'indicator' because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" directly references suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm just so tired of failing everyone""), isolation (""No one from my real life""), and despair (""I can't fucking do another year"").  
   - Plans/preparations: Specific timeframe (""new year's eve"") and references to **suicide notes** (""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one"").  
   - Past attempts: Mentions past suicide notes but **no description of actual past suicide attempts**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Ending it all"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, reinforced by ""suicide notes.""  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: References concrete **preparations (suicide notes)** and a **specific timeframe (New Year's Eve)**.  
   - No explicit method (e.g., tools/locations), but preparations (notes) qualify as planning under the ""behavior"" definition.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intent** (""ending it all on new year's eve"") and **past preparations** (notes), but **no past suicide attempts described**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific preparations (notes) + timeframe = **Behavior**.  
   - Suicide notes are explicit preparations (rule: ""preparations taken (e.g. suicide note)"").  
   - Not ""attempt"" because no past suicidal actions are described (only notes written).  
   - Not ""ideation"" due to clear planning elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions self-harm (""tried to cut myself last night"") during a breakdown.  
   - Emotional indicators: distress (""very bad night""), dissociation (""wanted to feel something real"").  
   - No explicit mention of death, suicide, or wanting to die.  
   - No specific suicide plans, methods, or preparations described.  
   - Refers to a past action (self-harm) but clarifies no prior history or desire to self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **No explicit mention of suicide, dying, or wanting to end life.** The focus is on self-harm as a coping mechanism.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Self-cutting is mentioned, but **no indication it was intended as a suicide method**. The stated goal was to ""feel something real,"" not to die.  
   - No evidence of planning for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Describes **a past event** (""last night"") of self-harm without suicidal intent.  
   - No current/future suicidal plans expressed.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post lacks any explicit reference to suicide, desire to die, or suicide planning.  
   - Self-harm occurred but is framed as an isolated incident driven by emotional distress, not suicidal intent.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress and self-harm without explicit suicidal ideation/plan.

   - Emotional indicators: ""i have nothing and no one,"" ""no purpose to live""  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is explicitly stated (""kill myself"").  
   - Direct expression of desire to die (""Why shouldn’t I?"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Uses the word ""plan"" but no concrete details (e.g., method, time, means).  
   - No evidence of preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""plan to kill myself""), not past actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire meets **Ideation** criteria.  
   - Absence of specific plans/methods rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past actions described, so not **Attempt**.  
   - Strong hopelessness but explicit suicide mention overrides **Indicator**.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself soon"" and discusses logistics (notification vs. surprise).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nobodyll do shit""), detachment from consequences.  
   - Specific plans/preparations: References timing (""soon"") and considers practical aspects (impact on others).  
   - No past attempts described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing yourself"" and ""being stopped"" explicitly reference suicide.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., tools/locations) is mentioned.  
   - **Preparation signs**: Actively debating notification strategies implies concrete planning for imminent action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""will be killing yourself soon"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicide mention and operational planning (timing, notification) align with **behavior**, as the post demonstrates actionable intent beyond mere ideation.  
   - Falls short of **attempt** (no past action described).  
   - Rules: When planning is evident (even without methods), choose 'behavior' over 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself tonight"", ""want to kill myself so bad"", ""hang myself"".  
   - Emotional indicators: ""tired of everything"", frustration (""god damn it"").  
   - Specific plan/method: ""hang myself at the woods"" (method: hanging; location: woods).  
   - Preparation: Mentions playing music beforehand, implying intent.  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself"", ""hang myself"").  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (hanging) and location (woods) are explicitly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to future intent (""tonight""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire + specific plan (method/location) → **Behavior** (per definition: mentions explicit planning).  
   - Rules: ""Brief mention of a plan"" qualifies as behavior; uncertainty favors 'ideation' only if planning is unclear (here, it is explicit).

I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way. I want to kill myself, already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching. Already started to cancel friendships.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I want to kill myself,"" which is an explicit reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of loneliness, hopelessness (e.g., ""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily with loneliness,"" ""What a joke"").
   - Specific plans or preparations are indicated: ""already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching"" and ""Already started to cancel friendships,"" which show planning and preparation for suicide.
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""I want to kill myself"" is a direct expression of wanting to die. (Yes)

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While no specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is detailed, setting a date (""set a date 2 weeks ago"") and taking preparatory actions (""started to cancel friendships"") constitute explicit planning. This aligns with the 'behavior' category's inclusion of ""preparations taken"" or a brief mention of a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (e.g., ""I'm approaching"" the set date), not past events. No past attempts are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit suicide mention rules out 'indicator'. The presence of a plan (date setting and preparations) elevates it beyond 'ideation' (which lacks specific plans). With no past attempts described, 'attempt' does not apply. The planning elements fit the 'behavior' definition, which includes ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan"" or ""preparations taken."" There is no uncertainty about the plan (date setting is explicit), so 'behavior' is appropriate over 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly includes ""so i dont kill myself"" and ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death."" This directly references suicide and death.
   - Emotional indicators: The post expresses hopelessness (""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""i dont like this shithole i live in but i cant change it"") and despair, indicating distress.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The references to suicide are general and lack concrete details about how or when.
   - References to past attempts: None. The post discusses current feelings and hypothetical questions about suicide, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: Yes (""kill myself,"" ""suicide"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: Yes, ""so i dont kill myself"" implies a desire to avoid suicide through current actions, and questioning whether suicide is ""bad"" suggests contemplation of death.
   - Since suicide is explicit, this is not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods are described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or substances).
   - No signs of preparation are present (e.g., no notes, acquired means, or timelines).
   - Uncertainty about planning: There is no explicit plan, so per rules, this leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions: The post focuses on present feelings (e.g., ""i have to so i dont kill myself"") and a general question about suicide, with no reference to past events.
   - No past attempts described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""kill myself,"" questioning the perception of suicide) without any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'Ideation' definition, which includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, but no concrete plan. It does not meet 'behavior' due to the absence of planning details, and it is not 'attempt' as there are no descriptions of past actions. 'Indicator' is ruled out because suicide is explicitly mentioned.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" twice, indicating a direct desire to not be alive. It also mentions the user feels like a ""coward"" for not acting on this desire, suggesting internal conflict and hopelessness. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or past attempts.
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes, ""I want to die"" is an explicit expression of wanting to not be alive, falling under suicidal ideation.
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific methods, plans, or preparations are mentioned. The user only expresses an inability to act due to fear, with no details on how they would attempt suicide.
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The language is present-tense (""I want""), referring to current feelings. No past suicide attempts are described.
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") but no plan or behavior. This aligns with the ""Ideation"" category, as there is a clear desire to die without specifics on execution. It does not fit ""Behavior"" (no plan), ""Attempt"" (no past action), or ""Indicator"" (suicidal thoughts are explicit).

Ive planned it all out, this is just a way of dying, knowing somebody noticed, and i feel cared about and worth it for the last few seconds i can ever memorize.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""suicidal since i was 9"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""this is just a way of dying"".
   - Emotional indicators: ""I cant take it"", ""hated myself"", ""tired of everything"".
   - Specific method: ""throw myself off a bridge"" (bridge as a location/method).
   - Preparation: ""Ive planned it all out"", ""locked in the bathroom"".
   - Past events: Self-harm history and suicidal feelings since childhood.
   - Current/future intent: ""before i littitimatly decide"", ""last few seconds i can ever memorize"".

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Direct expressions: ""suicidal"", ""throw myself off a bridge"", ""dying"".

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method/location: ""throw myself off a bridge"".
   - Preparation stated: ""Ive planned it all out"".
   - Clear intent for imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Primarily focuses on current plans (""decide to throw myself"", ""last few seconds"") alongside past struggles.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicide mentions and specific plan/method (bridge) override past references.
   - ""Planned it all out"" and method details meet the 'behavior' threshold.

   - Explicit mentions: ""commit suicide"", ""die of blood loss"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress about inability to get a boner.  
   - Specific plans/methods: ""twist my dick off"" (method), ""wait it off and die of blood loss"" (preparation/outcome).  
   - No references to past attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes, ""I'm gonna commit suicide"" is a direct expression of intent to die.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Self-harm via genital mutilation leading to blood loss.  
   - Preparation: ""I'm gonna try here"" implies imminent action.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Uses future tense (""gonna""), indicating current/future intent, not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions death and dying (""I will eventually die in a much painful way""), but it attributes this to the progression of a disease, not self-inflicted harm. It expresses emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I have no reason to live""), loneliness, and enduring physical and mental pain. There are no references to suicide, self-harm, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past suicide attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life""). The phrase ""I have no reason to live"" indicates hopelessness but is not a direct expression of wanting to die or not be alive. Since this is unclear, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The death referenced is due to disease, not planned action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current suffering and a future expectation of dying from illness, with no mention of past suicide attempts or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post contains general expressions of distress, hopelessness, and anticipated death from disease, but lacks any explicit suicidal thoughts, plans, or behaviors. According to the definitions, this fits 'indicator' because there is no direct mention of suicide, and strong hopelessness without explicit suicidal intent falls under this category. The rule to choose 'indicator' over 'ideation' when suicide is not explicitly mentioned applies.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide: The post includes explicit references like ""committing suicide successfully,"" ""killing yourself,"" and ""I'll still be suicidal."" It expresses envy of others who have died and rhetorical questions like ""Why can't that be me?"" which indicate a desire not to be alive.
   - Emotional indicators: The user describes feelings of envy, self-disgust (""bad person""), and hopelessness, but these are tied to explicit suicidal thoughts.
   - Specific plans or methods: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations for suicide. The focus is on thoughts and feelings, not actionable plans.
   - References to past attempts: None. The post discusses current thoughts, not past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""committing suicide,"" ""killing yourself,"" ""suicidal""). Direct expressions of wanting to die are present (e.g., ""Why can't that be me?""). This clearly moves beyond 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described. The user's statements about suicide are general and lack concrete planning. Without explicit planning, this aligns more with 'ideation' than 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current thoughts and feelings (e.g., ""I'm starting to get envious,"" ""I'll still be suicidal""), not past events or attempts. There is no mention of any prior suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I'll still be suicidal"") and a desire not to be alive, but no specific plans or methods. This matches the 'ideation' category, which covers explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan. It does not fit 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mentions, nor 'behavior' or 'attempt' due to the absence of planning or past actions.

The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious.

I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly states ""wants to die"" and discusses barriers (fear of hell, religious guilt) preventing action. It expresses hopelessness (""I'm probably going there anyways"") and isolation but contains:
   - Explicit expressions of suicidal desire (""wants to die"")
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned
   - No references to past suicide attempts
   - Emotional indicators of despair and internal conflict

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Wants to die"" is a direct expression of suicidal desire. The religious context clarifies this refers to self-inflicted death.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No. The post focuses on ideological/religious conflicts as barriers, with no mention of means, methods, or concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Current feelings/intentions are discussed. References to past actions (""done some bad shit"") are unrelated to suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal desire meets the threshold for **ideation**.
   - Absence of plans/preparations rules out **behavior**.
   - No description of past suicide actions rules out **attempt**.

The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions of suicide: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times"" (explicit).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't know how long I can cope""), despair (""crushed by stress,"" ""crippled by stress and anxiety""), isolation, and lack of support.
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.
   - No references to past attempts (only thoughts).
   - Temporal context: Suicidal thoughts occurred in the past (""for the past 2 years""), while current struggles focus on worsening stress/anxiety without new suicidal planning.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""killing myself"" is an explicit expression of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No mention of methods, plans, or preparations. Only historical thoughts are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed in the past (""thought of killing myself multiple times"" during prior years). Current content emphasizes emotional distress but lacks active planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit suicidal ideation is confirmed (""killing myself""), but no plan, method, or behavior is indicated. Past thoughts without actionable steps align with **Ideation**. Current distress lacks suicidal specificity, maintaining this category. Rules prioritize ""ideation"" over ""behavior"" when plans are absent and ""ideation"" over ""indicator"" when suicide is explicitly mentioned.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions a desire to die (""I just want to definitely die"") and seeks information on methods (""Where can I find out how to die"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both"").  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), preparations (e.g., acquiring means), or past attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned, but phrases like ""how to die"" and ""definitely die"" are direct expressions of wanting to die. **Yes** to explicit desire not to be alive.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - While the user asks ""where to find"" methods, no concrete plan, tools, locations, or preparations are specified. Uncertainty about explicit planning requires leaning toward 'ideation'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Focuses on current/future intentions (""want to definitely die""), not past events or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die qualifies as suicidal ideation. Lack of specific methods/preparations rules out 'behavior'. No past actions indicate 'attempt'. General distress isn't applicable due to explicit death wish.

I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty. Maybe it's that 'indifference toward other people' that they were talking about when I got diagnosed with PTSD (still reeling from that one, it never seemed bad enough to me. Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""will to die"" and ""if I do attempt again"" indicating past suicide attempt(s).
   - Expresses hopelessness (""don't want a future""), emotional exhaustion, and detachment from loved ones.
   - References a PTSD diagnosis and persistent distress.
   - States ""I'm not in immediate danger"" but implies future intent (""if I do it, it'll be at least a few months out"").
   - Notes having ""made enough plans"" for future events, delaying action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""will to die"", ""if I do attempt again"", ""if I do it"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described. General timeline (""few months out"") and ""made enough plans"" refer to life obligations, not suicide methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Explicitly references past suicide attempt (""attempt again""). Also discusses current/future suicidal thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Past suicide attempt (""attempt again"") definitively places this in **Attempt** per rules (""content describes past attempts""). Current ideation (""if I do it"") doesn't override this, as rules specify: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'"".

I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday.""
   - Specific method/plan: ""Bridge"" indicates a location-based method.
   - Temporal context: Future intent (""on Monday"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""No future""), worthlessness (""unemployed""), isolation (""mute,"" ""Nothing to say ever"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""kms"" (kill myself) appears twice, ""hangman's noose"" wallpaper as a suicide symbol, ""when I do it"" referring to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Being non religious... is HARDDD""), fixation (""can't get this girl out of my head""), internal conflict (""hardest decisions"").
   - Plans/preparations: Setting noose wallpaper ""to stay on track"", overcoming ""a big hurdle to kms"", ensuring mother ""won't be on the street"".
   - Past attempts: None mentioned (""tried to sleep"" is unrelated to suicide).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""kms"" x2, suicidal imagery of noose).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., drugs, location) described. The noose wallpaper symbolizes intent but isn't a concrete plan. ""Overcame a big hurdle"" implies preparation but lacks actionable details (e.g., acquiring tools/setting date).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post contains explicit expressions of wanting to die (""I want to die"") and strong emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born,"" ""my adulthood is all downhill from here""), despair (""I haven't been happy in 2 years""), and feelings of failure. There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or references to past suicide attempts.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS: Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned through direct statements like ""I want to die,"" which clearly expresses a desire not to be alive. The later phrase ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore"" introduces ambivalence but does not negate the explicit suicidal ideation expressed earlier.
3. PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION: No specific methods, plans, or preparations for suicide are described. The post focuses on emotional pain and a desire to escape life but lacks concrete details about how suicide might be carried out.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT: The post discusses current feelings and future-oriented hopelessness (e.g., ""I feel like I've seen enough of my future to want to continue""). There are no references to past suicide attempts or actions.
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The explicit expression of wanting to die (""I want to die"") meets the criteria for 'ideation,' as it indicates suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The absence of methods, preparations, or past attempts rules out 'behavior' and 'attempt,' while the explicit suicidal desire prevents classification as 'indicator.'

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions multiple explicit suicide methods: overdose (120 aspirin pills), firearm (purchased gun, researched headshot placement), hanging (purchased rope, attempted partial suspension), and current preparation of an exit bag with gas.
   - Describes past suicide attempts (aspirin overdose leading to hospitalization, firearm malfunction during attempt, failed hanging attempt with physical injuries).
   - Expresses current suicidal planning: ""Today, I have an exit bag set up,"" including testing the gas valve. 
   - Emotional indicators: Despair, numbness, loneliness, fear of pain/failure, and regret over pushing people away.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes. Direct statements include ""committing suicide,"" ""desire to die,"" and detailed accounts of attempts.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific current method: Exit bag with gas, including preparation (""I've done it perfectly"") and partial execution (""I turned that gas valve""). 
   - Past methods are explicitly described (aspirin, firearm, hanging). 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to three past attempts (ages 15, 21, and recent hanging). 
   - Describes current/preparatory behavior (exit bag setup and gas test). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post details **past suicide attempts** (aspirin overdose, firearm incident, hanging), meeting the ""Attempt"" definition. 
   - Though current plans (exit bag) are mentioned, the rules specify: ""when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'."" 
   - Current preparations alone would fit ""Behavior,"" but the explicit recounting of historical actions prioritizes ""Attempt.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""should just end my life"" directly references self-inflicted death.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile"") and despair (""I'm a garbage person,"" ""I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to weapons, substances, or plans).
   - No references to past suicide attempts are present; the language is focused on current feelings and future intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned: ""end my life"" is a clear and direct expression of wanting to die. This rules out 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide methods or preparations are described. The post expresses a desire but lacks details on how, when, or where the suicide would occur. Since there is no evidence of planning, this does not qualify as 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current and future intentions (""should just end my life"") rather than past events. There is no mention of previous attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""end my life"") with a stated desire to die, placing it beyond 'indicator'. However, the absence of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'behavior'. There is also no description of past actions, so 'attempt' is not applicable. Therefore, the best fit is 'ideation', as it involves explicit suicidal ideation without a plan.

   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""I don't see a reason to live"") and despair (""Life sucks"").
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No details on methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - References to past attempts: None; the language is focused on current/future intentions (""about to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die: ""I don't see a reason to live"" indicates a desire not to be alive. Clear, so no need to default to 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, locations) are described.
   - No indications of preparation. The phrase ""about to"" suggests intent but lacks concrete planning details. Uncertain about explicit planning, so lean toward 'ideation' over 'behavior' as per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""about to""), not past events. No mention of past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post contains explicit suicidal thoughts (""kill myself,"" ""don't see a reason to live"") but no specific plan or method. This aligns with the 'ideation' definition, which covers explicit desires to die without a plan. It does not meet the threshold for 'behavior' (requires explicit planning) or 'attempt' (past actions). It cannot be 'indicator' due to the explicit suicide mention.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""face death"" and working out ""until i die"" indicate acceptance/willingness toward death. 
   - Emotional indicators: ""pissed,"" ""embrace the pain,"" hopelessness (""don't even want to feel good anymore"").
   - Specific plan: Working out excessively for 12 hours with explicit intent to risk death (""if not, well, you know what happened"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - No explicit use of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""die"" is directly tied to the user’s planned actions. Leans toward 'ideation' or 'behavior' due to intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method: Self-destructive overexertion (""working out until i die"") with a 12-hour timeframe.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post asks ""Can duloxetine kill you?"" and mentions having pills saved ""for later.""
   - Duloxetine is an antidepressant, and inquiring about its lethality combined with hoarding pills suggests potential suicidal intent.
   - No explicit emotional descriptors (e.g., hopelessness) or past attempts are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - No direct expressions like ""I want to die"" or explicit suicide references. The phrasing is indirect (lethality question + pill stockpiling).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method (duloxetine overdose) is implied by questioning lethality.  
   - ""Saving pills for later"" indicates preparation (acquiring/stockpiling means). This qualifies as explicit planning under the ""behavior"" definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""saving for later""), not past actions. No mention of prior attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The combination of method inquiry (duloxetine lethality) and concrete preparation (hoarding pills) aligns with ""behavior."" While suicide isn’t explicitly stated, the lethal method and active preparation meet the threshold for ""behavior"" per the rules.

   - Emotional indicators: Strong expressions of distress are present, such as ""It's hell,"" ""I feel so empire"" (likely a typo for ""empty""), ""out of place,"" and ""Not anymore"" (suggesting hopelessness and despair).
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. There is no reference to tools, locations, substances, or any suicide preparations.
   - References to past attempts: No description of past suicide attempts. The phrase ""haven't yet"" indicates no action has been taken, focusing on current feelings rather than past events.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"").
   - Direct expressions of wanting to die or not be alive are absent. The statement ""I just want to end"" is ambiguous and could mean ending suffering rather than life. Since it is unclear, the rule dictates leaning toward 'indicator' over 'ideation'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) are discussed.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are evident.
   - As there is no explicit planning, this does not meet the threshold for 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post describes current emotions (e.g., ""Today's a great day. It's hell,"" ""I feel so empire"") and a present desire (""I just want to end""), not past actions. The phrase ""haven't yet"" reinforces this is about current intentions, not history.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a vague desire to ""end,"" but it lacks explicit suicidal intent or references to suicide. Per the rules, general dissatisfaction or hopelessness without explicit suicide mention falls under 'indicator'. The ambiguity in ""I just want to end"" does not rise to 'ideation' because it is not clearly a desire to die, and the instruction is to choose 'indicator' when in doubt about explicit mention.
   - It does not qualify for 'behavior' (no plan) or 'attempt' (no past actions described).

489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself"" directly express a desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""My brain is my body's worst enemy""), fatigue as a ""defense mechanism.""  
   - Specific method: Mentions buying gas as a means to ""off myself.""  
   - Preparation: None described; procrastination delays action.  
   - Past attempts: Not referenced.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Dead by the end of the day"" and ""off myself"" are explicit expressions of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method mentioned**: Gas is explicitly named as a means (""go buy the gas"").  
   - **No preparation described**: Procrastination prevents action, but the method is clearly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to **current/future intentions** (""could be dead by... today""). No past attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (ideation) + specific method (gas) = **Behavior**.  
   - Rules: Mentioning a method (even without acting) triggers ""behavior"" classification.

490,"I should stop being a pussy and do it. I post about suicide constantly, I should just suck it up and do it already.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains phrases like ""do it"" and ""suck it up and do it already,"" directly referencing acting on suicidal thoughts.  
   - Explicit mention: ""I post about suicide constantly"" confirms the context of ""do it"" as referring to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: Frustration (""stop being a pussy,"" ""should just suck it up"") and urgency (""do it already"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No references to past attempts; focuses on current intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**:  
   - Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly stated, and ""do it"" contextually means committing suicide.  
   - Direct expression: ""I should just suck it up and do it already"" conveys a desire to act.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**:  
   - Refers to current/future intentions (""do it already""), not past events.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""do it"") and mention of suicide, but no plan, method, or preparation details.  
   - Falls under **Ideation** (explicit suicidal thoughts without specific plans).  
   - Rules applied: No ambiguity about suicide mention → not *indicator*. No plan → not *behavior*. Not past action → not *attempt*.

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The post explicitly states ""I planned to kill myself in the forest in January"" and ""I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe."" It also describes self-harm: ""I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down.""
   - Emotional indicators: The user expresses being overwhelmed, unmotivated, and ""done with everything,"" but also claims not to be sad or depressed and feels ""happy"" in a detached way. This includes hopelessness about continuing life.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Methods like hanging and using an axe are detailed. Preparations are explicitly mentioned: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car.""
   - References to past attempts: The user mentions a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") but clarifies it was not carried out (""But I didn't""). There is no description of a past suicide attempt; only self-harm (cutting) is referenced as a past behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned multiple times (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""hang myself""). There are direct expressions of wanting to die, such as ""end it.""

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods are mentioned: hanging with a rope and cutting off a finger with an axe.
   - Signs of preparation are clear: ""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car."" This indicates the means have been acquired.
   - Since methods and preparations are explicit, this points to 'behavior' rather than 'ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post refers to a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") that was not acted upon, so it is not a past attempt. The primary focus is on current intentions: ""I plan to hang myself..."" and the preparations are present-tense. No actual past suicide attempt is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes explicit suicidal thoughts and a specific, actionable plan with methods and preparations, fitting the 'behavior' category. The past self-harm and unacted plan do not override the current evidence of planning. There is no uncertainty about the plan or preparations, so 'ideation' is not appropriate. 'Attempt' does not apply as no past suicide attempt occurred. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit suicide mentions.
   - IMPORTANT RULES applied: The risk is for the person writing the post, and all elements (e.g., self-harm, plans) refer to them.

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses existential themes, such as the pointlessness of life (""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""there still is no point for us being here"") and expresses hopelessness (""It's the dumbest shit ever"", ""I feel like... there still is no point""). 
   - There is a mention of not wanting to exist (""I wish I was never born"") but it is countered by an explicit statement against wanting to die (""but at the same time don't really want to die""). 
   - No references to suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past attempts are present. The content is philosophical and focuses on general dissatisfaction with life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Suicide is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no words like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""end my life""). 
   - While ""I wish I was never born"" implies a passive desire not to exist, it is not a direct expression of wanting to die, especially since it is qualified by ""don't really want to die."" Thus, there is no clear expression of suicidal thoughts. Leaning toward 'indicator' as per rules for unclear cases.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The post is entirely reflective, with no indication of planning or intent to act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post discusses current feelings and philosophical views, with no references to past events or suicide attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows general distress, hopelessness, and dissatisfaction with life but lacks any explicit mention of suicide, desire to die, or plans. The statement ""don't really want to die"" directly negates active suicidal intent. This aligns with the 'indicator' category, which includes vague feelings about death or existential despair without explicit suicidal expressions. Rules emphasize that when suicide is not explicitly mentioned or desired, it should be classified as 'indicator'.

I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep shame, embarrassment, and anxiety about social judgment due to purchasing a sex toy. Key elements include fear of being perceived as ""disgusting"" at a new school, regret over past actions, and hopelessness about first impressions. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past attempts. Emotional indicators include shame and distress, but not despair tied to ending life.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit references to suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""end my life,"" ""want to die"" are absent).  
3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No discussion of methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations for self-harm/suicide.  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Focuses on past actions (buying the item) and future fears (starting school), with no references to past suicide attempts or current suicidal plans.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post shows emotional distress but lacks any explicit suicidal ideation, planning, behavior, or references to attempts. General expressions of shame/hopelessness without suicidal intent align with ""indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm: The phrase ""kill yourself"" is a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Expressions of hopelessness (""sick of it""), suffering, and anger (""selfish,"" ""asshole move,"" ""why do you want me to suffer"") indicate despair.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: No specific methods (e.g., tools, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - References to past attempts: No description of past suicide attempts; the focus is on current feelings and family阻拦.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS:**
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill yourself""), and there is a direct expression of wanting to die (""they dont let you kill yourself"" implies a desire to act). Leaning toward 'ideation' or higher, not 'indicator'.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific methods (e.g., weapons, substances) or preparations are described. The mention of suicide is general, without details on how, when, or where. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, this points to 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT:**
   - The post discusses current feelings (""you suddenly get sick of it"") and frustrations about being prevented from acting, not past events. No reference to past attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post explicitly expresses suicidal thoughts (""kill yourself"") and a desire to die, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with the 'ideation' category (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan). It does not fit 'behavior' (requires explicit planning), 'attempt' (requires past actions), or 'indicator' (suicide is explicitly mentioned).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense loneliness (""am i lonely""), perceived lack of care (""nobody fucking cares""), self-loathing (""spoiled piece of shit""), and a direct plea to die (""pls fucking end me before the day. pls""). It also references coercive statements (""nobody cares till i say im going to do it""), implying prior threats of self-harm/suicide to elicit concern.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: Yes. ""Pls fucking end me"" is an explicit, first-person desire to die. ""Say im going to do it"" contextually implies suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No specific method (e.g., tools, locations) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is described. The plea ""end me"" is a wish for external action, not a self-initiated plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: The post describes current emotional distress (""before the day"") and references past coercive statements (""till i say""), but no description of past suicide attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end me"") confirms suicidal intent, ruling out *Indicator*.  
   - No mention of methods, preparations, or active steps toward suicide, ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past self-harm actions, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under *Ideation*: explicit expression of suicidal desire without a specific plan or preparatory behavior.

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" explicitly in the phrase ""with a suicide,"" and expresses a desire to die with ""I hope it'll be me next"" (referring to being a victim of stabbing). This indicates a wish not to be alive. There are emotional indicators of shame and hopelessness (e.g., ""bring shame in the family""). However, the stabbing is framed as an external event hoped for, not a self-inflicted act. No specific method or preparation for suicide is described (e.g., no tools, locations, or plans for self-harm), and there are no references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes, suicide is explicitly mentioned (""with a suicide""). There is also a direct expression of wanting to die (""I hope it'll be me next"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide method or plan is identified. The stabbing is not presented as a self-harm method but as a hoped-for external incident. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described. Since there is uncertainty about explicit planning, the analysis leans toward 'ideation' over 'behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - The post refers to current/future intentions (e.g., ""I hope it'll be me next""), not past events. No past attempts are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit mention of suicide and the desire to die align with the 'ideation' category, which includes expressions of suicidal thoughts without a specific plan. The absence of a detailed method or preparation rules out 'behavior', and the lack of past actions rules out 'attempt'. The presence of explicit suicidal thoughts means it is not 'indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""killmyself"", ""put an end to it all"", ""kill myself"".
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (e.g., ""0 friends... no skills no job no money""), despair.
   - Specific plans/methods: Mentions relocating (""go to another country""), changing identity, and framing suicide as an accident.
   - No references to past attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes (""killmyself"", ""kill myself"", ""put an end to it all"").

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific methods/preparations: Planning to disappear, change identity, and stage death as an accident. This constitutes explicit planning (concealment strategy and outcome design).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Focuses on future intentions (""how can I just disappear?"", ""so I can just kill myself"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""I tried to kill myself last night"", ""ALMOST FUCKING DIED"", ""WANTED TO [die]"".
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme frustration (""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), hopelessness (""I had enough""), and determination to end life.
   - Specific plans/methods: Describes a past attempt via suffocation (mask/plastic bag/blankets) and mentions a future attempt tonight with a backup ""Plan B"".
   - Preparation: References tools (mask, plastic bag) and implies readiness for another attempt.
   - Past attempts: Explicitly states ""I tried to kill myself last night"".

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: 
   - Yes: ""kill myself"", ""die"", ""take me to Heaven"" (implies death).

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes: Specific suffocation method described for the past attempt, and explicit intent to reattempt (""gonna try again tonight"") with a backup plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: 
   - Refers to a past attempt (""last night"") and current/future intentions (""tonight"", ""Plan B"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post details a **past suicide attempt** with a specific method and outcome (""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED""). It also mentions imminent plans for another attempt. Per the rules, when a post references past attempts **and** current plans, it must be classified as **'attempt'**. The description of the method (""suffocation using a mask..."") and stated intent (""I FUCKING WANTED TO"") further confirms this category over 'behavior' or 'ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post describes feelings of extreme tiredness (""soooo tierd""), emptiness, and worry about causing harm to friendships due to a depressive episode. Positive life aspects (rugby, uni, relationships, HRT progress) are acknowledged. No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, preparations, or past attempts are present. Emotional indicators are limited to fatigue and depressive emptiness without expressions of hopelessness or despair about life itself.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE MENTIONS**: No explicit mention of suicide, wanting to die, or not wanting to be alive. Statements like ""want to sleep 24/7"" indicate avoidance/exhaustion, not death-seeking intent.

3. **PLAN OR METHOD IDENTIFICATION**: No references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm/suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT**: Concerns are current (e.g., ""worried about ruining my friendships""). No allusions to past events or actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post reflects general distress and depressive symptoms but lacks any explicit suicidal expressions or plans. Vague dissatisfaction (e.g., feeling ""empty"") without suicidal intent falls under 'indicator' per the definition. Positive acknowledgments further support this as non-ideation.
