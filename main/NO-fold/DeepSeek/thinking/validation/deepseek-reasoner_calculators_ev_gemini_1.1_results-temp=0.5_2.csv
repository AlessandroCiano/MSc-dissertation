0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of suicide: ""thinking about ending my life again"" (explicit suicidal thought) and ""I want to go to a bridge and jump off"" (specific method/location).
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Never will find love,"" ""everything in my life is crap""), self-loathing (""I hate being myself,"" ""I wish I was attractive""), despair (""mental breakdown"").
   - Specific plan/method: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" indicates a concrete method (jumping) and location (bridge).
   - Temporal context: ""again"" implies past ideation/behavior, but no description of a *past initiated action* (e.g., ""I tried to jump""). Current desire is future-oriented (""I want to go"").
   - Desire to die: Explicit (""ending my life,"" ""jump off"") with no negation (e.g., no ""but I won’t"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes: ""ending my life"" and ""jump off"" are direct expressions of suicidal desire. No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes: ""go to a bridge and jump off"" specifies both a method (jumping) and a location (bridge). No preparations mentioned (e.g., note, travel plans), but the method/location detail suffices for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes *future* intent (""I want to go"") and references past thoughts (""again""), but **no description of a past/current initiated action** (e.g., ""I went to the bridge yesterday""). Thus, not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Clear desire to die (suicidal ideation) + specific method/location (plan) = **Behavior**.  
   - Past reference (""again"") is vague and lacks concrete action, so it doesn’t qualify as 'Attempt'.  
   - Method is explicit (""jump off a bridge""), so not 'Ideation'.

1,I'm inconsolable. I'm going to die soon,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains emotional indicators: ""I'm inconsolable"" suggests despair and hopelessness.
   - It mentions death: ""I'm going to die soon"" implies a belief in imminent death, but it does not specify suicide, self-harm, a method, or any preparations (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).
   - There is no reference to past actions, plans, or methods. The temporal context (""soon"") indicates imminence but lacks specificity about intent or action.
   - The writer's stated desire is not explicitly suicidal (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself""). Instead, ""I'm going to die soon"" could reflect a sense of hopelessness or a prediction, not necessarily a personal desire to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - It expresses a belief about dying soon in a context of despair, but this is not a clear, personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., it lacks phrases like ""I want to be gone""). The absence of explicit suicidal desire or intent leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation is mentioned. Without these elements, it cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future-oriented belief (""soon"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt). Thus, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The phrase ""I'm going to die soon"" in despair could be ambiguous, but it lacks a clear expression of personal suicidal desire or intent. Per the guidelines, if there is doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, 'Indicator' should be chosen. The primary sentiment is distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal thoughts or plans, fitting 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' because no desire to die is personally expressed, and it does not include suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I want to die""). There is no plan or action for 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

2,I hate living. sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night. fuck,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong negative emotions: ""I hate living"" indicates despair and hopelessness. The phrase ""sometime i think about why i have to live until now just because two person fucked in a night"" reflects existential distress, questioning the purpose of life, but it does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. There are no emotional indicators like being a burden or anhedonia beyond general dissatisfaction. No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. The temporal context is vague (""sometime""), with no imminence indicated. The writer's stated desire is focused on hating life, not explicitly wanting to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The expression ""I hate living"" conveys distress but does not clearly state a desire to die (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly mentioned; instead, the thoughts are about the futility of life. Since there is no explicit suicidal desire and the thoughts are not framed as unwanted suicidal ideation, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. Without any indication of planning, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current feelings and occasional thoughts (""sometime i think""), with no reference to past or recent actions. No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness without a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire. ""I hate living"" is a strong indicator of emotional pain but lacks explicit suicidal intent. The absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Given the ambiguity in suicidal desire and the focus on life dissatisfaction, the post aligns with 'Indicator' (as per the rule: if in doubt between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator).

3,Help me kill myself. Please somebody help me find some trustworthy barbiturates/Nembutal,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. It also specifies a method: ""barbiturates/Nembutal,"" which are substances used for lethal overdose. The emotional tone is one of desperation and urgency, with a plea for help in obtaining these means. There are no references to past actions or attempts, but the request for ""trustworthy barbiturates"" shows active preparation to acquire suicide means. The imminence is implied by the urgent ""Help me"" and ""Please,"" but no specific timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated. The writer's desire to die is clear and not negated as unwanted; it is a direct call to action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly says ""kill myself,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, the writer is actively seeking means to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal for overdose) is mentioned. The request for help in finding these substances indicates active preparation to acquire the means for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current intention and preparation but no past or recent initiated action (e.g., no description of taking pills or being interrupted). The focus is on planning and obtaining means, not on an action that has already occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (barbiturates/Nembutal) and active preparation (seeking to acquire them) elevates it beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). Since no past or recent initiated lethal action is described, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, it fits 'Behavior', which includes suicidal thoughts with a plan, method, or preparation.

4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions death/dying: ""Is there a painless way to die,"" ""I want to sleep forever,"" ""I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm struggling,"" ""I feel worthless,"" ""I'm tired""), self-blame (""selfish,"" ""lazy""), anhedonia (""unmotivated""), isolation.
   - No specific plan/method/preparation: Asks about painless methods but doesn’t name tools, locations, or describe preparatory actions.
   - No past actions: No reference to initiated suicide attempts.
   - Imminence: No temporal cues (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"").
   - Desire: Expresses fatigue and a wish to ""sleep forever,"" implying a desire to escape life, but no explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Explicit phrases: ""die"" (repeatedly) and ""sleep forever"" (common metaphor for death). 
   - Desire to die: ""I want to sleep forever"" signals a personal wish to not be alive. No statement negating this desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act"").
   - **Conclusion**: Explicit desire to die is present → Leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or tools mentioned. 
   - No preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means). 
   - Only abstract inquiry (""painless way"") without commitment to a plan. 
   - **Conclusion**: No plan/method/preparation → Not 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes current feelings and thoughts, no past/ongoing suicidal actions. 
   - **Conclusion**: No initiated lethal action → Not 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Clear personal desire to die (""sleep forever"") → Not 'Indicator'.
   - No method, plan, or preparation → Not 'Behavior'.
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions → Not 'Attempt'.
   - Explicit suicidal ideation without actionable steps → **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""want to kill myself"" explicitly and repeatedly questions the purpose of life, expressing deep hopelessness (""life is all pointless,"" ""huge waste of time"").  
   - Emotional indicators include despair, anhedonia (loss of meaning), and persistent thoughts about death and futility.  
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned.  
   - The writer references *past* suicidal thoughts (""for a year straight"") but no concrete past actions (e.g., attempts).  
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (""I still want to die,"" ""why shouldn’t we just kill ourselves""). There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""want to kill myself"" and ""why shouldn’t we just kill ourselves"" confirm explicit personal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal desire is clear, there is no mention of a method, plan, or preparation. The discussion is philosophical (e.g., ""none of it will matter when you're dead"") without actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *past* ideation (""for a year straight... thinking about how nothing matters"") but **no initiated actions**. Current statements are contemplative (""should do it anyways"") without reference to imminent or recent acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and direct references to suicide (""kill myself"") rule out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned (e.g., pills, locations, notes), so *Behavior* does not apply.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  
   - **Conclusion**: The post expresses current/persistent suicidal desire without plans or actions → **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense mental pain, hopelessness, and a desire for relief, with key phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight,"" ""I want it to be over tonight,"" and ""I don't wanna survive it."" These indicate a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include despair (""I'm in so much mental pain""), anhedonia (""I hate everything""), and a need for peace. There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or references to past actions. The temporal context is imminent (""tonight""), emphasizing a current desire for death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I want to be gone tonight"" and ""I don't wanna survive it,"" which convey a clear, personal wish not to be alive. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to die"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. While ""I want this pain to turn into physical"" could imply self-harm, it is vague and not linked to a concrete suicide method or actionable plan. Without explicit details (e.g., ""I have pills"" or ""I'm going to jump""), this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""tonight"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was started or completed). It expresses desire and ideation, not behavior that has been acted upon.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear personal suicidal intent). The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (as per rules: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation'""). No past or recent action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The content fits 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal thoughts and desire to die without a stated plan.

It's the best for me."" There are no mentions of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or locations. No past or recent suicidal actions are described. The focus is on current despair and a stated desire to die.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - The writer does not negate or express unwanted thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  
   → **Yes**, explicit desire to die is present.

I just feel tired and lonely because of these thoughts.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" directly, indicating suicidal thoughts. However, it explicitly states ""I don't actually want to,"" showing the thoughts are unwanted. Emotional indicators include feelings of being ""ugly,"" ""stupid,"" ""not good enough,"" ""tired,"" and ""lonely,"" with distress about internal struggles. No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., notes), or references to past actions are present. The focus is on enduring unwanted thoughts without any imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" but the writer negates this with ""I don't actually want to,"" indicating no personal desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are framed as intrusive and unwanted, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The content is limited to thoughts and emotional distress, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing thoughts (e.g., ""keeps telling me"") with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. No initiated or potentially lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The key distinction is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation': The writer expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they do not want to die, making the thoughts unwanted and not reflective of a current personal desire. This aligns with the 'Indicator' definition (general distress with unwanted suicidal thoughts, no genuine desire to die). No plan or action elements are present, so 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' do not apply. Per the rules, if there's ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness, stagnation, and feelings of being damaged (""im stuck, stagnant,"" ""Im damaged,"" ""falling down this void"").  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I want to call it a day and kill myself,"" ""Honestly I want to die now, right now.""  
   - Specific methods mentioned: ""run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids.""  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) described—only hypothetical or future-oriented statements (""if there was a button,"" ""either I run..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""I want to die now,"" and ""erase all traces of my existence."" The desire is personal and current, with no negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (knife, opioids) are proposed as potential actions (""either I run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer""). Though tentative (""I don’t know""), the explicit naming of lethal methods qualifies as planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""if there was a button,"" ""I would go for it"") and hypothetical scenarios. No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: While suicidal thoughts are present, the mention of specific methods (knife/opioids) moves this beyond desire-only.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No concrete past/recent initiated lethal action described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions severe distress: schizo-affective disorder, paranoia (""people are going to hurt me""), deterioration, insomnia.
   - Expresses desire to end suffering: ""I just want to get it over with.""
   - Fear of pain related to acting on suicidal thoughts: ""The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it.""

   - **Yes**, explicit desire to die is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions feelings of abandonment (""everyone leaves""), self-blame (""maybe it's me?""), and emotional detachment (""I push people away"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""it starts to hurt less. but... it still hurts"") and self-directed frustration (""I'd leave myself if I could"").  
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.**

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Core themes are **hopelessness, isolation, and self-criticism** without personal suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors.  
   - The phrase ""I'd leave myself if I could"" is metaphorical distress, not suicidal ideation (e.g., differs from ""I want to disappear forever"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feelings of inadequacy (""failed all development stages""), codependency, lack of identity, anxiety, self-doubt, anhedonia, dissociation, hopelessness (""not fixable, no hope""), and loneliness.  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is stated: ""i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not."" This indicates a future plan tied to a specific age (21).  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""whether i want to or not"" suggests internal conflict but affirms a concrete plan.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states ""i plan to kill myself,"" confirming a personal desire to die. The ambivalence (""whether i want to or not"") does not negate the stated plan.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A **future timeline** is specified (""at 21""), but no method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The lack of these details means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal plan is future-oriented (""i'm 18 now... plan to kill myself at 21""). No past/current actions (e.g., initiating self-harm) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die (""plan to kill myself"") places this beyond 'Indicator'.  
   - The absence of a specific method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No concrete past/recent suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
   - The core is a stated future plan to die by suicide without actionable details, fitting 'Ideation'.

Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?I have prolly stopped making sense at this point. But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""I want to die,"" ""I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence,"" ""I am not going to kill myself at least not any time soon.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""Nobody is getting anything out of this""), isolation (""haven’t spoken to anyone in months""), anhedonia (""don't like anything about myself""), and distress (""sick and tired of crying myself to sleep"").  
   - Plan/method: Explicitly negates imminent action (""not any time soon,"" ""given myself 5 more years""). No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - Temporal context: Refers to ongoing distress and future contemplation (5-year timeframe), but no past or recent suicidal actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""I want to die"" is a direct expression of desire. However, this is partially countered by ""I am not going to kill myself... not any time soon,"" which explicitly rejects imminent intent. The desire to die is present but deferred.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The vague 5-year timeframe lacks concrete details (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""gun,"" ""note"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). Focus is on current emotional pain and future contemplation without initiation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Strong desire to die (""I want to die"") leans toward *Ideation*, but the explicit rejection of imminent action and lack of a plan complicates this. However, the core expression (""I want to die"") is a personal, current desire to not be alive, aligning with *Ideation*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned (e.g., ""pills,"" ""bridge,"" ""note""), so *Behavior* is ruled out.  
   - **Attempt**: No past/recent potentially lethal actions described.  
   - Final decision: *Ideation* fits best due to explicit personal desire to die, despite the deferred timeline. The absence of a plan/preparation and rejection of imminent action keeps it in *Ideation* (desire present, no plan).

I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing.

I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions death/suicide: Explicitly states ""the only way out is suicide"" and ""I've considered hanging.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""things are crushing,"" ""overwhelmed,"" ""stuck in this rat race""), worthlessness (""never good enough,"" ""not smart enough""), isolation (""no friends,"" ""belittled"").
   - Method: Specifically references ""hanging.""
   - Desire vs. unwanted thoughts: Expresses genuine desire (""I feel like the only way out is suicide"") but explicitly negates ability to act (""I don't have the guts to do it,"" ""I can't seem to go through with it"").
   - Plans/preparations: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or setting a timeline.  
   - Past actions: None described (only consideration of hanging, not initiation).
   - Imminence: No time frame (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit phrases: ""suicide"" and ""hanging"" are directly mentioned.  
   - Clear desire: States ""the only way out is suicide,"" indicating a wish to escape via death.  
   - Unwanted thoughts? While distress is present, the desire to escape via suicide is affirmed, not rejected as unwanted. The hesitation (""no guts"") relates to capability, not desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - Method identified: ""Hanging"" is mentioned as a considered method.  
   - Preparation? No evidence of gathering tools, choosing a location, or rehearsing. The phrase ""considered hanging"" implies contemplation, not actionable planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Describes current/future thoughts (""I feel like...""), not past actions.  
   - No initiated action: References considering hanging but *not* attempting it (""can't go through with it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Explicit desire to die (""only way out is suicide"") and method mention (""hanging"") rule out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** While a method (""hanging"") is named, there is no indication of active planning (e.g., acquiring rope, selecting location) or preparation. The language (""considered"") suggests contemplation, not commitment to a plan.  
   - **Attempt:** No description of past/current initiated lethal actions.  
   - Conclusion: Suicidal desire is explicit, and a method is considered, but no plan/preparation exists. Fits **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""suicidal notes ready.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""ain't no way i'm doing this shit for another year"").  
   - Specific plans/preparations: ""decided on it,"" ""matter of when and how,"" and ""got my suicidal notes ready.""  
   - No past actions described; focuses on future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""decided on it,"" confirming a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**: Explicit preparation (""got my suicidal notes ready"") and contemplation of timing/method (""matter of when and how"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes future intent (""going to kill myself"") and current preparations (notes ready).  
   - **No past or recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no mention of trying a method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Specific preparation (suicide notes) and method/timing consideration** → Rules out 'Ideation'.  
   - **No initiated action** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"") → Rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits **'Behavior'** due to stated desire + explicit preparations (notes) + planning (""when and how"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing, body dysmorphia, and a desire to escape one's identity (""wish I could press a button and be someone else""). 
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i still look disgusting""), despair, and low self-worth. 
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions. Actions described (dying hair, changing clothes, diet) are attempts at self-improvement, not self-harm. 
   - No temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"") or stated desire to die. The core desire is transformation (""be someone else""), not cessation of life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct expressions of a wish to die. 
   - The closest statement (""wish I could press a button and be someone else"") implies escapism/change, not death. 
   - **No suicidal thoughts are mentioned at all**, wanted or unwanted. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No references** to methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes ongoing distress and past efforts to alter appearance, but **no past or recent suicidal actions**. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe emotional distress and hopelessness but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior**. 
   - Wishing to ""be someone else"" does not equate to a desire to die. 
   - Falls under **Indicator** (general distress without explicit suicidal intent).

17,"What are you hoping to gain?. For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves or are in the process of doing so, what do you hope to gain by posting that information here? In my opinion everyone that does so is looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses people who post about intending to kill themselves or being in the process, questioning their motivations (e.g., ""what do you hope to gain by posting that information here?""). 
   - The author expresses an opinion that such posters are ""looking for help and isn't really wanting to hurt themselves."" 
   - No personal mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness, despair) from the author themselves. 
   - No references to personal plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. 
   - The focus is on abstract commentary about others' behavior, not the author's own state.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post references suicide indirectly through discussion of others (e.g., ""they are going to kill themselves""), but there is **no explicit mention of suicide or desire to die from the author personally**. 
   - The author does not express any personal suicidal thoughts, desire to not be alive, or struggle with unwanted thoughts. Instead, they speculate about others' intentions. 
   - This leans strongly toward 'Indicator' as there is no personal expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No personal plan, method, or preparation is mentioned by the author. The discussion is solely about hypothetical or general behaviors of others. 
   - Since there is no personal suicidal desire expressed, this step does not apply to the author.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes no past, current, or future personal actions by the author. It is a general inquiry and opinion about social media behavior. 
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described for the author.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or attempt. It is an abstract discussion about suicide, focusing on others' posts and motivations. 
   - This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes general or abstract discussions of suicide without a clear, current, personal desire to die from the author. 
   - Rules emphasize that suicide risk corresponds only to the author, not others mentioned, and there is no ambiguity here about personal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains multiple expressions of hopelessness (""No point in existing,"" ""no point in being alive,"" ""tired of being alive"") and self-perceived burden (""every word... hurts the people you love"").  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I want to be brave enough to kill myself.""  
   - Past actions are disclosed: ""the past two times ive tried ive failed,"" indicating concrete suicide attempts.  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, ""kill myself"" is directly stated. The desire to die is clear (""I want to be brave enough...""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** current plan, method, tools, or preparations are mentioned. References to past attempts lack specifics about methods.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **past actions**: ""the past two times ive tried."" The phrase ""tried"" implies initiated, potentially lethal acts (attempts) that failed.  
   - Current expressions (""tired of being alive"") reflect ongoing ideation but no imminent plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The disclosure of past suicide attempts (""tried"") meets the **Attempt** definition: self-initiated, potentially lethal actions, even if failed.  
   - Current suicidal desire (""I want to be brave enough to kill myself"") is present but secondary to the confirmed past attempts.  
   - Rules state: **Attempt takes precedence** when past concrete actions are described.  
   - No current plan/method rules out 'Behavior'; past actions elevate this beyond 'Ideation'.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""My desire to kill myself has not,"" ""Killing myself,"" references to overdose attempts (""I've attempted an overdose twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""why bother?""), despair (""I don’t care anymore""), feeling efforts are futile (""it’s meant literally nothing"").  
   - Plan/method: No *current* plan/method described, but **specific past actions** (overdose attempts) are detailed.  
   - Past actions: Clearly describes **multiple initiated suicidal acts** (overdoses) in the past two weeks/six months.  
   - Imminence: Desires are current, but no immediate timeline for future action stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""My desire to kill myself,"" ""Killing myself.""  
   - Yes. Clear desire to die: ""I just want out... I’d honestly choose that."" No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No *current* plan/method/preparation mentioned.  
   - Past method (overdose) is referenced but is historical.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past concrete actions**: Overdose attempts (twice in two weeks, three times in six months). These were *initiated, potentially lethal acts* (even if survived).  
   - Current suicidal desire is present but lacks plan/preparation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** applies because the post documents **specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal past actions** (overdoses).  
   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - Current ideation/desire exists but does not override the precedence of described past attempts.  
   - No *current* plan/method, so not 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense distress, fear, panic attacks, and feeling overwhelmed by health concerns (possible diabetes) and DIY HRT risks.  
   - Mentions ""I can't live without estrogen"" and ""it's just too much,"" but **no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or methods**.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""what the fuck do I do?""), fear of parental judgment, and feeling ""weak.""  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or past suicidal actions** described.  
   - Focus is on desperation about health/gender dysphoria, not ending life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No** phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die.  
   - ""I can't live without estrogen"" implies dependency on HRT for quality of life, **not a wish to die**.  
   - Distress stems from fear of consequences (health/parental reaction), **not suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION:**  
   - **None** mentioned. No tools, locations, preparations, or references to suicide plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**

     - Expresses severe distress, hopelessness, and fear about health/gender dysphoria.  
     - **Lacks personal desire to die**, suicidal thoughts, or any plan/behavior.  
     - ""I can't live without estrogen"" is contextualized as fear of losing HRT access, not a death wish.

Now it's time to end it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""There is NO hope left"") and despair about failed treatments (medications, biofeedback, therapy, EMDR, TMS). 
   - Financial hardship is emphasized (""live on $786 a month,"" ""some days don't even eat""), eliminating a potential treatment option (Ketamine). 
   - The phrase ""end it"" is a direct reference to suicide. 
   - Repetition of ""I tried"" refers to treatment efforts, not suicidal actions (confirmed by context: ""I tried [treatments]... Now it’s time to end it""). 
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline is mentioned (e.g., tools, location, note-writing). 
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions exists—only a future intention.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: ""end it"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal intent without negation (e.g., no language like ""but I don’t want to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., buying means, writing a note) are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is nonspecific.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past attempts at treatment (""I tried [treatments]""), not suicidal acts. 
   - ""Now it’s time to end it"" signals future intent, not an initiated action. No past/current suicidal behavior is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly expresses a desire to die (""end it"") with no plan/method/preparation. The phrase ""I tried"" refers to treatments, not suicide attempts (ruling out 'Attempt'). The absence of method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. Strong suicidal desire distinguishes this from 'Indicator'.

   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no notes, acquired means, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - References past coping (""tried to hide this by saying 'I am misanthrope'"") but **no past suicidal actions or attempts**.  
   - Stated desire: Expresses persistent suicidal thoughts without indicating they are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""thinking about suicide"" in a personal, present-tense context of despair.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts** (""Everyday I am thinking about suicide"").  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** initiated; past reference is to emotional coping, not an attempt.

24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""What's the use,"" ""I've given up in life""), despair, and a sense of being a burden (""only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family""). It explicitly mentions a lack of fear of death (""There is no hell so I'm not scared to die"") and includes specific suicidal preparations: ""I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April."" There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., tools or substances), but the ""plan"" and ""note"" indicate clear preparation. The temporal context is future-oriented (""early April""), with no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was started or completed). The desire to die is implied through the context of having a plan and not fearing death, but it is not explicitly negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it expresses a clear, personal desire to die through statements like ""I'm not scared to die"" in a context of despair and the mention of a suicide plan. The writer does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted; instead, the plan and note suggest acceptance and intent. Therefore, explicit intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific preparations are mentioned: ""plan, note and date."" While no method (e.g., pills, gun) is detailed, the existence of a ""plan"" and a suicide ""note"" constitutes clear preparation for suicide. This indicates concrete steps toward action, moving beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references past life events (dropping out of college, cutting off friends) but no past suicidal actions. The suicidal elements (""plan, note and date"") are described as future intentions (""will be in early April""), with no indication that any action has been initiated (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). Thus, this is not a past or recent attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (not abstract or unwanted thoughts), so it is not 'Indicator'.
   - It includes suicidal thoughts with specific preparations (plan, note, date), so it is not 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (past or recent), so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of preparations (plan and note) with a future timeframe fits 'Behavior', as per the definition: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions... preparations being taken.""

Final decision: 'Behavior' is the best fit due to the stated plan, note, and date, indicating active preparation for suicide.

25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""tell them I'm going to kill myself,"" ""actually do go through with it and kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one would care,"" ""end up dead in a gutter""), despair (""I don't care""), self-harm (""cuts all over myself""), and feeling like a burden (""best for society if I just stay inside"").  
   - Plans/preparations: Considering self-admission to a psychiatric ward *or* acting on suicidal thoughts. No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned for suicide, and no physical preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are described.  
   - Imminence: ""I'm still debating,"" ""haven't even left home yet"" – no immediate timeframe.  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly states a desire to die (""kill myself"") without negating it as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm going to kill myself"" and ""kill myself"" in the context of personal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method**: While suicide is explicitly mentioned, no tools, locations, or substances are named.  
   - **No preparation**: Describes considering hospitalization *instead* of suicide but no active steps toward suicide (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **future intentions** (""I plan,"" ""still debating"") with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation is specified. The hospitalization alternative is a preventative consideration, not a suicide plan.  
   - **Not Behavior**: Lacks concrete plans/methods (e.g., ""use a gun,"" ""jump from X"").  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal intent is personal and explicit, not abstract or unwanted.

I told someone that im suicidal, they know that if i hang out with them really helps me, but they don't do anything about, they insist that they care but i dont believe it, maybe its my brain playing with me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal,"" indicating direct references to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Im not special to anything or anyone or myself,"" ""there's no me at this point"") and feelings of being unsupported (""they insist that they care but i dont believe it""). A specific method is implied (""a good clif"" for jumping) with details on location and feasibility (""around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). However, there is no mention of preparations (e.g., going to the cliff, writing a note) or past actions related to suicide attempts. The writer expresses an inability to act (""i can't commit to it""), suggesting internal conflict, but the desire to die is present. No imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""suicidal."" It expresses a genuine desire to die, as seen in the frustration about not being able to commit (""i can't kill myself,"" ""i just can't commit to it""). While there is distress about others not helping, the suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, the focus is on the barrier to acting on them. Thus, this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (jumping from a cliff) and location (""a good clif"") are mentioned, along with practical details about accessibility (""around 4-5km, its possible to get there""). This constitutes a plan element. No preparations or actions are described, but the presence of a method is sufficient to lean toward 'Behavior' (as per the definition: mentions of a plan or method with suicidal desire).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and a method but no past or recent initiated actions. References to telling someone about being suicidal and hanging out are about seeking support, not suicide attempts. No concrete actions (e.g., ""I tried to jump"") are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit suicidal desire and a specific method (cliff), so it is not 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire) or 'Ideation' (which has desire but no plan). The method mention qualifies as 'Behavior', even though the writer states an inability to commit. Since no action was initiated, it is not 'Attempt'. The presence of a plan/method is explicit, so 'Behavior' is appropriate (and not 'Ideation', as the rules specify to choose 'Ideation' only if unsure about the plan/method, which is not the case here).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""i have nothing going for me""), despair (""i'm tired of everything""), anhedonia (""i'm tired of my life""), and feelings of being a burden or worthless (""i'm tired of hating myself,"" ""i'm tired of being ugly""). Key phrases are ""i just want it all to stop"" and ""i wish i was never born."" There are **no** mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The focus is on exhaustion and wishing for nonexistence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - ""I wish I was never born"" implies a passive desire for nonexistence but **not** an active, current desire to die or end life.  
   - No references to suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).  
   → Leans toward **Indicator**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   → No evidence for **Behavior** or **Attempt**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing feelings, **no** past/current suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, self-harm, or interrupted actions).  
   → Rules out **Attempt**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is profound distress and hopelessness without explicit suicidal desire. ""I wish I was never born"" reflects a passive wish for non-existence rather than active intent to die.  
   - Lacks explicit personal desire to die, plan, method, or action.  
   - Ambiguity about active suicidal intent pushes toward **Indicator** per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense distress (""Depressed,"" ""shit show"") and feelings of isolation/rejection from family and friends (""fake ass friends,"" ""shitty family"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: ""I can't wait to fucking kill myself"" is a direct, personal statement of desire to die.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (dismissive response from mom), anger (""last big fuck you""), and perceived burden themes.  
   - **Plan/Method**: Mentions a funeral outcome but **no specific method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., pills, note-writing, acquiring means).  
   - **Temporal context**: Desire is future-oriented (""can't wait,"" ""gonna be""), with **no description of past/initiated actions** (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""kill myself"" with no negation (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to""). Expresses clear desire to die (""can’t wait"").

   - **No plan/method/preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""end it all,"" ""goodbye everybody.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no one really understands,"" ""I doubt anyone will care"").  
   - Plan/method: States ""I already know how I’m gonna do it"" (confirms a specific method exists) and temporal context (""gonna wait a few weeks"").  
   - Preparation: Mentions intent to conceal plans (""I’m not gonna tell anyone"").  
   - Past actions: References prior help-seeking (""all ready tried that before""), but this describes outreach, not a suicide attempt.  
   - Imminence: Action is delayed (""wait a few weeks"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""end it all"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""end it all"" and ""goodbye"" indicate a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Yes: Explicitly states a known method (""I already know how I’m gonna do it"") and preparation (concealment, farewell).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intent, not past/current action. The phrase ""all ready tried that before"" refers to prior disclosure attempts, not a suicide attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions intense hopelessness (""I'm a disappointment,"" ""burden,"" ""existence screws up everyone's lives"") and explicit suicidal desire (""I can't even fucking kill myself,"" ""It'd be better off for everyone if I did it"").
   - References a specific method (""I hold the blade"") and active preparation (""I hold the blade but can't fucking do it"").
   - Expresses a clear personal desire to die but describes being unable to act on it (""can't fucking do it,"" ""I should be able to"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses hopelessness and despair about life (""Life's not about being yourself..."", ""stripping yourself of individuality""), feeling unsupported by family (""family doesn't like a depressed 16 year old, but doesn't even deal with him""), and includes a rhetorical death reference (""how about i die then, is that what you ask for?""). There are no mentions of suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The death statement appears reactive and questioning (""is that what you ask for?"") rather than declarative.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - The phrase ""how about i die then"" expresses a hypothetical outcome framed as a question to others, not a clear personal desire to die. It lacks direct ownership of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - The rhetorical context suggests distress about external expectations, not a stated wish to act on suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The death reference is vague and interrogative, framed as a response to others' perceived desires. The core sentiment is distress about isolation and invalidation, not a personal expression of suicidal desire.  
   - Lacks explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, preparation, or action. Fits **Indicator** due to generalized hopelessness without clear personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself,"" ""taking my own life,"" and a definitive statement: ""It is now 100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life.""
   - Emotional indicators are strong, including hopelessness (""There is no hope. All is lost"") and despair (""pointless, meaningless, and a waste of energy"").
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, substances, notes, or acquired means). The reference to a ""daily reminder"" on the computer wallpaper reinforces intent but does not constitute concrete preparation like obtaining means or writing a note.
   - There is a reference to a past action: ""At least I DID try."" However, this is ambiguous and likely refers to general life efforts (e.g., ""keep trying"") rather than a specific suicidal act, as there is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action.
   - Imminence is indicated with ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday (which is in 2023),"" but this is future-oriented and not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal: ""100% confirmed that I will be taking my own life,"" with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and ""taking my own life.""
   - Yes, it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""100% confirmed,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday"" in a context of despair).
   - No, suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted; the author affirms them as certain and inevitable.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of tangible preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note, or giving things away). The ""daily reminder"" on the wallpaper is a psychological reinforcement of intent but not a concrete preparation as defined.
   - Since no plan, method, or preparation is identified, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""I will be taking my own life,"" ""I will not live to see my 40th birthday"") with no immediate timeframe.
   - The phrase ""At least I DID try"" refers to past efforts in life (context: ""even keep trying""), not a past suicidal action. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal intent rule out 'Indicator'.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (as per the rule: if unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior').
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, but without any plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions past opportunity to ""kill myself"" 6 months ago and regret about not acting (""I was a pussy... shouldn't have talked myself down"").
    - Expresses current desire to die (""Everyday I want to go back and kill myself"").

I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up. But I know I'll just forgive him and continue to be used by everyone I know. I'm pathetic,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress, including feelings of weakness, embarrassment, and being pathetic. It discusses social difficulties with a friend and ex-partner, but there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators like hopelessness (""I know it's never gonna happen"") and despair are present, but they are tied to relational issues, not self-harm. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are mentioned. The writer's stated desire is for normalcy and friendship, not a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive; instead, the focus is on resolving interpersonal conflicts and emotional pain.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so the aspect of unwanted thoughts doesn't apply. The content leans toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned or implied. The ultimatum discussed is social (giving a friend time to ""make things right""), not related to self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes past social actions (e.g., trying to cut off friends, giving an ultimatum) but no past or recent suicidal actions. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal self-harm event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress, hopelessness, and feelings of worthlessness but lacks any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or suicidal action. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which covers expressions of distress without current suicidal intent. There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (which requires desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires past/recent lethal action). Ambiguity rules support choosing 'Indicator' when suicidal desire is unclear or absent.

35,"Why isn't there some technology that transports me to a world of my choosing?. Today's my birthday. I feel hollow. Everyone expects happiness and joy. I feel nothing but sadness that I have to live another day where I'm not allowed to be sad. Birthdays are just a way for your ""friends"" and ""family"" to pat themselves on the back for remembering and being nice. I haven't truly enjoyed a birthday in 4-5 years, since I was 11 or so. Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years. My only choice now is to suffer in silence because nobody gives enough of a fuck to ask a side character how they're doing. God I fucking hate myself.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: ""hollow,"" ""sadness,"" ""hate myself,"" ""suffer in silence,"" ""painful middle ground.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness: ""Never have I felt a lasting happiness,"" ""cycle for years.""  
   - References death metaphorically (""kill myself working"") but clarifies it’s not literal.  
   - Explicitly states: **""I just want to not exist""** and **""God I fucking hate myself.""**  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" (literal intent).  
   - **Yes** to expressions of desire to cease existing (""not exist"") and despair, but lacks clarity about *acting* on suicidal intent.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are implied but not framed as unwanted; instead, they reflect distress.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None** identified. No tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing emotional pain, not past/planned actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Strong indicators of distress and hopelessness but **no explicit personal desire to die by suicide**.  
   - ""Not exist"" suggests passive ideation, but ambiguity leans toward **Indicator** (distress without clear suicidal intent).  
   - No plan/method → rules out *Behavior* or *Attempt*.  
   - Lacks explicit suicidal desire needed for *Ideation*; phrases are closer to existential despair.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains repeated expressions of intense distress (""losing my mind,"" ""breakdown,"" ""tired of being alone/worthless/failing,"" ""hate myself"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal desire**: ""I just want to end it,"" ""i just want to put a bullet right through it,"" ""i dont want to be here anymore,"" and multiple repetitions of ""i just want to die.""  
   - **Method mentioned**: ""put a bullet right through it"" implies firearm use.  
   - **Contradictory element**: The writer states they ""don't have the balls to take my own life"" and pleads ""someone please murder me,"" indicating reluctance to act personally.  
   - **Temporal context**: No reference to past actions or imminent plans; focuses on current despair.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""end it,"" ""put a bullet right through it,"" and ""i just want to die"" show unambiguous personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: Firearm (""bullet"") is specified.  
   - **No preparation**: No evidence of acquiring means, writing notes, or imminent execution (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Ambiguity**: The method is named, but the writer explicitly doubts their ability to act (""don't have the balls""), weakening behavioral intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings only; no past or recent actions (e.g., no ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While a method (""bullet"") is mentioned, the writer’s self-described inability to act and lack of concrete preparations lean toward 'Ideation'. The guidelines specify: *""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""*  
   - **Attempt**: No initiated action described.  
   - Final call: 'Ideation' (desire to die + method referenced but no clear plan/preparation, with self-doubt about acting).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide watch,"" ""wish i could just fucking end it,"" ""subjectively it would be better if i was dead."" 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""wasn't made for life,"" ""can't keep doing this,"" ""loathe myself""), worthlessness (""contribute nothing,"" ""accomplished nothing"").
   - Specific method/plan: ""take a bunch of pills while everyones asleep.""
   - Barriers/ambivalence: Fear of pain (""too scared,"" ""don't want to die in pain""), concern for others (""don't want to make my mother sad"").
   - No past actions described; focus is on current thoughts and hypothetical future behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""suicide watch,"" ""end it,"" and explicit desire (""it would be better if i was dead"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**. A specific method (""take a bunch of pills"") and timing (""while everyones asleep"") are mentioned, indicating a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes potential future action (""could take pills"") but no initiated or past lethal action. Barriers (fear, concern) are noted, but the plan itself is explicit.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Explicit desire to die** (Ideation threshold met) + **specific plan/method** (pills + timing) = **Behavior**.  
   - Ambivalence (fear, guilt) doesn’t negate the presence of a plan. No concrete past/current action (ruling out Attempt).

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post primarily discusses the writer's concern for a friend who is at high risk of suicide, including explicit mentions of the friend's plan (""commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days)""). 
   - For the writer themselves, there are references to past suicidal experiences: a history of suicidal ideation (""I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life"") and a past suicide attempt in 2009 (""I did have one very serious attempt... which almost succeeded""). However, the writer explicitly states they are currently in a good place with no recent suicidal ideation (""I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months"").
   - No current emotional indicators of hopelessness or despair from the writer; instead, they express proactive concern for their friend and seek advice. There is no mention of current desire, plan, method, preparation, or imminent action related to suicide by the writer.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The writer mentions past suicidal thoughts and a past attempt but explicitly negates any current desire or intent (""haven't had suicidal ideation in months""). There is no expression of a current wish to die or be dead. Suicidal content is either historical (about the writer) or external (about the friend), not reflecting the writer's present state.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is described for the writer. The only reference to method/preparation is historical (the 2009 attempt) or pertains to the friend. The writer's current focus is on support and problem-solving for their friend.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The writer describes a past suicide attempt (2009), which was a concrete, initiated action. However, it is not recent (over a decade old) and is not accompanied by any indication of current or imminent action. The writer emphasizes their improved mental state and lack of current ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The writer shows no current personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, or preparation. Past suicidal experiences (ideation and attempt) are acknowledged but do not indicate present risk, as they are explicitly contrasted with the writer's current stable state. The distress expressed is about the friend's situation, not the writer's own suicidal intent. This aligns with 'Indicator', which covers general distress, discussions of suicide in an abstract or external context, and unwanted past thoughts without current personal desire. There is no ambiguity for 'Ideation', 'Behavior', or 'Attempt' since the writer lacks current suicidal intent, plan, or recent action.

Its so much to ask for and I'm scared the help won't help me. Does that make sense?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""lol kermit sewer slide thoughts"" (a slang reference to ""suicide"").
   - Expresses emotional distress: fear therapy won't work, tired of being afraid/upset, shame, lack of motivation.
   - Describes persistent intrusive suicidal thoughts (""even on days where I'm actually happy""), calling them ""tempting.""
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - No temporal markers indicating immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Focuses on distress about unwanted thoughts and fear of ineffective help.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""sewer slide"" explicitly references suicide, but the context frames these as intrusive thoughts (""I still get the... thoughts"") rather than a current personal desire to die. The writer emphasizes distress about the thoughts and seeks help, indicating they are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., note-writing), or location. Only general thoughts are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Discusses ongoing thoughts but no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried..."" or ""I took..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts explicitly but frames them as intrusive/unwanted (""I still get... thoughts"") and lacks a desire to act. The core sentiment is distress about these thoughts and fear of failed treatment.
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No initiated action → rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Ambiguity exists about genuine desire to die, but the emphasis on thoughts being persistent yet unwanted, combined with seeking help, aligns best with 'Indicator' per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it? It's looking pretty good but I'm a coward and don't know how to deal with end of life stuff (my belongings, my phone, etc)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post contains strong expressions of self-hatred (""I hate myself,"" ""I shouldn't exist""), hopelessness (""my life is disgusting,"" ""I hate being alive""), and explicit suicidal desire (""I want to kill myself so badly""). 
   - Specific methods are mentioned: ""jump in front of a train"" and logistical preparations (""how to deal with end-of-life stuff: my belongings, my phone""). 
   - There is no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions; all statements are future-oriented wishes or hypotheticals (""I wish I had the guts,"" ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?""). 
   - The author expresses a current desire to die but acknowledges hesitation due to fear (""I'm a coward"") and practical barriers.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""I want to kill myself so badly"" and ""Someone want to push me to go thru with it?"" The desire to die is unambiguous and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**. The method ""jump in front of a train"" is explicitly stated, and end-of-life preparations (""dealing with belongings, phone"") are mentioned. This elevates the risk beyond mere ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described. All references to suicide are aspirational (""wish I had the guts"") or conditional (""if I did kill myself""), with no indication of initiated behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method (train) + preparations (belongings) confirm **Behavior**. While the author expresses fear/hesitation, the presence of a plan/preparation rules out 'Ideation'. No concrete past/current suicidal action occurred, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The intensity of suicidal intent distinguishes this from 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a direct mention of suicide and a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include intense distress (""I cant breathe,"" ""fuck me"" repeated), feelings of worthlessness (""im useless""), and hopelessness (""everyone would be better off with me dead""). There are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions. The language is present-tense and expresses immediate anguish, but no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified. The writer's desire to die is clear and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to kill myself"" and implications from ""everyone would be better off with me dead"").
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not intend to act on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). Thus, this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned or implied. The focus is solely on the desire and emotional state, not on how or when the act might occur.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""I want to kill myself"" in present tense) but does not reference any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, interruptions, or failures). It is entirely focused on present ideation.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of clear personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., an attempt) means it cannot be classified as 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it includes a clear, personal expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without any indication of a plan, method, or preparation.

Final Classification Reasoning: Based on the analysis, the post expresses suicidal ideation with explicit desire but no actionable details, aligning with the 'Ideation' category definition.

Final Classification: ideation",ideation,True
42,"confinement mental break down. i thought about slitting my wrists today, but i didnt do it. i am growing more depressed and feeling more alone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""slitting my wrists,"" which is a specific method related to suicide or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include ""mental break down,"" ""growing more depressed,"" and ""feeling more alone,"" indicating hopelessness and despair.
   - The phrase ""thought about"" refers to a suicidal thought, but it is explicitly negated with ""but i didnt do it,"" indicating no action was taken.
   - There is no mention of a plan, preparation (e.g., acquiring tools), or imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The writer describes a past thought (""today"") but no initiated action, and the primary sentiment is distress about depression and loneliness, with the suicidal thought presented as something considered but not acted upon.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""slitting my wrists"" implies suicidal intent.
   - It expresses a thought about a suicidal act but does not clearly state a current desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). Instead, the focus is on the thought occurring and being resisted (""but i didnt do it"").
   - The suicidal thought is not explicitly described as unwanted (e.g., no ""I don't want these thoughts""), but the lack of action suggests distress rather than intent, leaning toward 'Indicator' if ambiguous.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (""slitting my wrists"") is mentioned, but only in the context of a thought (""thought about""), not as part of a current plan or preparation.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acquiring means, writing a note, or setting a location) are present.
   - Since the method is referenced passively in the thought and not as an active plan, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. The rule states to choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' if unsure about an explicit plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past thought (""today"") but no action was initiated or completed (""but i didnt do it"").
   - There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was started or carried out, ruling out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The key distinction is between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. The post includes a mention of suicidal thoughts with a method, but the desire to die is not explicitly stated; instead, the thought is presented in the context of distress (""growing more depressed"") and is resisted. According to the rules, if there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (e.g., thoughts mentioned without clear intent), 'Indicator' should be chosen. Additionally, the method is part of the ideation but not linked to a plan, so it remains 'Ideation' only if desire is clear, which it is not. Therefore, 'Indicator' is more appropriate as the primary expression is distress, with suicidal thoughts as an unwanted or passive element.

Final category: 'Indicator' (due to ambiguity in desire and the focus on distress, with suicidal thoughts not representing a current personal intent to die).

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post discusses dental issues causing pain and shame, leading to distress. It mentions ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" as a result of the situation. There are emotional indicators like shame, hopelessness (""paying the price""), and physical pain, but no explicit references to death, dying, or self-harm methods. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for suicide are mentioned. The suicidal feelings are framed as recurring due to current distress, but there is no indication of a desire to act on them or any past suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal feelings,"" which directly references suicide.
   - However, it does not express a clear, current desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't alive""). The phrasing ""suicidal feelings are coming back"" suggests distress about recurring thoughts, but it lacks a personal expression of intent. There is no statement that these feelings are unwanted or negated, but the ambiguity leans toward 'Indicator' as per the rules for doubt.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The content focuses solely on dental problems and emotional distress.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references past depression and current suicidal feelings but describes no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interrupted actions, or preparations). The phrase ""coming back"" implies recurrence of thoughts, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal feelings"" indicates suicide-related content, but it lacks a clear, personal desire to die or intent, fitting 'Indicator' (which includes distress with suicidal thoughts if not explicitly desired). There is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (e.g., no direct wish to die), so as per the rule, 'Indicator' is chosen over 'Ideation'. No plan or method is present, ruling out 'Behavior', and no actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

If you want more information and are interested in helping, I can explain it better in the chat.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements include a request for help with basic necessities and a direct statement: ""i'm someone who wants to die."" This expresses a personal desire to die, linked to feelings of distress or exclusion (e.g., not meeting subreddit rules). There are no mentions of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to pills, guns, notes, or goodbyes). No past or recent suicidal actions are described, and no temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight"") suggest imminence. The desire to die is explicitly stated but not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the phrase ""wants to die"" explicitly expresses a clear, personal desire to not be alive, without any qualification that the thoughts are unwanted or not acted upon. This indicates suicidal intent from the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., overdose, jumping), tools, substances, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The post focuses on financial distress and the desire to die as a contextual factor, but lacks concrete suicidal planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The desire to die is described as a current state (""wants to die"") but not tied to a specific timeframe or action. There is no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts), so this does not indicate an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expression of a desire to die (""wants to die"") meets the criteria for 'Ideation' because it conveys suicidal thoughts without a plan, method, or preparation. It does not fit 'Indicator' because the suicidal desire is personal and not abstract or unwanted. There is insufficient evidence for 'Behavior' (no plan/method) or 'Attempt' (no described action).

45,Anyone know how to write good suicide notes? I'm leaving soon but need my loved ones to know I love them so much but I don't know how to put it all into words. Don't say please don't go. Stay. My minds made up. I just need help on the goodbye letters,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes"" and ""goodbye letters,"" which are direct references to suicide preparations. It includes emotional context like expressing love for loved ones but also a firm decision (""My minds made up"") and a sense of imminence (""I'm leaving soon""). The request for help with writing notes indicates active preparation. There is no mention of a specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or past actions, but the focus is on preparatory steps for suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide notes,"" which directly relates to suicide. It expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""I'm leaving soon"" and ""my minds made up,"" with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., the user dismisses劝阻 with ""Don't say please don't go"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (e.g., tools, location) is not mentioned, but there is explicit preparation: writing ""suicide notes"" or ""goodbye letters"" is a recognized preparatory step for suicide. This qualifies as ""preparations being taken,"" aligning with the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm leaving soon"") and current preparations (writing notes). There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which would apply if suicidal thoughts were unwanted or abstract). The mention of preparations (writing notes) distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan or preparation). Since no past or recent suicidal action is described, it is not 'Attempt'. Therefore, the presence of preparations places it firmly in 'Behavior'.

I just hoped I could get some comfort if there was any left with my psych before I end thing v v soon. save some flowers for me please? I like lavender",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""suicide date"" (specifically ""This Friday, May 14, 2021""), ""end things v v soon,"" ""constant attempts"" (past), and ""only reason I didn’t die last night"" (recent aborted action).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I’m fucking done""), distrust of professionals, trauma/PTSD references, feeling unheard.  
   - Plan/method: Specific future date for suicide (""May 14, 2021"") and urgency (""before it"").  
   - Preparation: Implied by setting a date, though no explicit tools/methods are named.  
   - Past actions: ""8 yrs of constant attempts"" and ""didn’t die last night"" (recent non-fatal action).  
   - Desire to die: Explicit (""suicide date,"" ""end things"") but conflicted (""I actually wanna live if I could get help"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicide date"" and ""end things"" show current personal desire to die. The conflicted wish to live is conditional (on receiving help), not a negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific date (""May 14, 2021"") and urgency (""before it"") constitute a clear plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past actions (""constant attempts,"" ""didn’t die last night"") are described, but the post emphasizes a **future** plan (""This Friday""). The past attempts are referenced to contextualize despair, not as the primary focus.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Specific plan (date)** → Upgrades from *Ideation* to *Behavior*.  
   - **Past attempts** are mentioned but are not the core event; the imminent future plan dominates. No *initiated* lethal action is described for the current crisis (last night’s incident was aborted due to a wish for help). Thus, *Attempt* does not apply.  
   - **Conclusion**: *Behavior* (desire + specific plan/preparation).

47,"Pointlessness. I know someone's gonna hit me with ""well if everything's pointless, then it doesn't matter if nothing matters"". Which doesn't make things better. It doesn't make me want to go rogue and have fun with life because I've let everything go, and come what may until in my grave I lay. No, I am sick of everybody's fascination with ""having a personality"" and ""being a good person"". Everybody wants you to be their monkey. I don't want to look on the bright-side, to have confidence or assertiveness. I am bad at both those things. If I was good at them, I wouldn't want them. That's my point. If we have an option as humans to be any way we want, I vote we be no way at all. I want to be the missing pixel which burned out, or the missing puzzle piece nobody ever finds. I am so sick of appearances. People care SO MUCH about how other people are. It's sickening. I should start being rude to people, in line with how I feel about us. I know there's a heaven and it distresses me. I want to disappear forever and I know God won't let that happen. I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit. What's difficult is the pain caused to people I care about and who care about me, but I don't really think it'll matter one way or the other. They'll suffer and that will be that, different and worse than had they not suffered, but just another experience at the end of the day.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of death/dying: Explicitly states ""I know I will die by 35. I am 22 now and that is my outer limit."" Also expresses a desire to disappear forever (""I want to be the missing pixel..."", ""I want to disappear forever"").
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""Pointlessness,"" ""It doesn't make things better""), despair (""I am sick of everybody's fascination""), anhedonia (""I don't want to look on the bright-side""), and feeling trapped (""I know God won't let that happen"").
   - Plans/methods/preparations: **No** specific method, tool, location, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes). Only a vague timeline (""die by 35"").
   - Past actions: **None** described (e.g., no reference to prior attempts or actions).
   - Imminence: Specifies a future timeframe (""by 35""), not immediate (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""I want to disappear forever,"" indicating a genuine wish to cease existing, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I want to disappear forever"" and ""I know I will die by 35"" (in context of despair) show a clear personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **No**: The timeline (""die by 35"") is vague and distant. No mention of specific means (pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring tools).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes **future intention** (""will die by 35""). **No** mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Ideation**: The post expresses an explicit, personal desire to die (""disappear forever,"" ""die by 35"") but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. The future timeline alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' without concrete planning. No past actions qualify for 'Attempt'. Distress is present but secondary to the stated desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide methods: ""hanging myself"" and ""taking these pills.""  
   - Direct desire to die: ""I'm trying to die.""  
   - Assessment of feasibility due to body weight and method effectiveness (e.g., breaking structures, pills causing sickness/brain damage instead of death).  
   - Humor/irony used (""😂"", ""😎""), but core message expresses frustration with barriers to lethal suicide.  
   - No past actions described—only hypothetical/future-oriented planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""kill yourself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""taking these pills,"" and ""I'm trying to die"" confirm a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**: Two specific methods (hanging, pill overdose) are mentioned.  
   - Writer evaluates viability (""idk if hanging myself would work,"" ""idk if taking these pills would work""), indicating active consideration of means.  
   - No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring tools), but method specificity leans toward 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Discusses future intentions (""might,"" ""would work"")—no description of past/initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Methods (hanging, pills) are specified, moving beyond mere desire.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No past/recent initiated lethal actions described.  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire + specific methods assessed for feasibility. Humor does not negate suicidal intent or planning.

I feel like I can't even think straight anymore, I don't know.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicidal thoughts: ""I want to die"".  
   - Emotional indicators: ""depressed and numb,"" ""sick of everything,"" ""can't think straight,"" hopelessness.  
   - **Denial of plan/preparation**: ""I don’t have a specific plan for killing myself,"" ""probably not gonna do anything because I’m scared of messing it up.""  
   - No reference to methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, weapons).  
   - No past actions described (e.g., no ""I tried"").  
   - Desire to die is stated but countered by fear of acting and consideration of safety (""maybe I need that right now"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit desire (""I want to die"").  
   - No statement framing thoughts as unwanted/distressing without desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Actively denies having a ""specific plan"". No method, tools, or preparations mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses future consideration of psych ward but **no past/current suicidal actions**.  
   - Fear of acting (""scared of messing it up"") implies no initiated behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") meets the threshold for 'Ideation'.  
   - **Not Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation (explicitly denied).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/current concrete suicidal actions.

50,every night i count my pills. and every day i wonder why i didnt take them all. why am i such a coward when im living a life nobody loves or cares for me in?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""pills"" and ""take them all,"" which implies a specific method (overdosing) for suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nobody loves or cares for me"") and self-blame (""why am i such a coward""). There is a recurring behavior (""every night i count my pills"") that suggests preparation or access to means. The phrase ""wonder why i didnt take them all"" indicates regret over inaction but no description of a past or current initiated action. No explicit timeline or imminence is stated, and the desire to die is implied but not directly stated (e.g., no ""I want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" It expresses a desire through regret for not taking the pills, implying a wish to die, but this is indirect. Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the author expresses frustration at their inaction, suggesting a genuine, though conflicted, desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned (""pills"" for overdose). The behavior ""every night i count my pills"" indicates ongoing engagement with the means, which can be interpreted as preparation (e.g., having access and ritualizing the thought). This presence of a method and preparatory behavior leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes recurring thoughts and behaviors (nightly counting, daily wondering) but no past or recent initiated action. ""Why i didnt take them all"" refers to inaction, not an attempt. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was started.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') due to the implied desire to die and specific method. It includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts (regret over not acting) and mentions of a method/preparation, so it is not 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method). No initiated action occurred, so it is not 'Attempt'. The combination of suicidal desire (implied), specific method (pills), and preparatory behavior (counting pills) fits 'Behavior'. Since the method is explicit and preparation is indicated, 'Behavior' is appropriate over 'Ideation'.

I honestly don't know what to do at this rate.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""thoughts"" being ""unbearably strong"" and in a ""major downward spiral,"" with daily struggles and a desire to keep this secret to avoid hospitalization. However, there are no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., ""downward spiral,"" ""struggle,"" ""I honestly don't know what to do""), but no desire to die is expressed. The reference to ""psych ward again"" implies past mental health issues but does not describe any suicidal actions or intent. Imminence is absent (no time frame like ""tonight""), and the thoughts are framed as a distressing experience rather than a current wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. No clear desire to die is expressed (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die""). The post focuses on distress about intense thoughts and fear of hospitalization, but it does not indicate that these thoughts involve a personal desire for suicide. If the thoughts imply suicidal ideation, it is not stated, and the context suggests unwanted distress, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no mention of pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes) are mentioned. The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing struggles over months but no past or recent suicidal actions. The reference to ""psych ward again"" hints at a history of mental health crises but does not detail any concrete, self-initiated suicidal act (e.g., no description of an attempt). Without evidence of an initiated action, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses general distress and emotional turmoil but lacks explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent. The ""thoughts"" could be interpreted as potentially suicidal, but they are not specified, and the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts and fear of hospitalization. Given the ambiguity and no clear suicidal desire, per the rules (doubt leans to 'Indicator'), this fits 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts/desire), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires a described action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of emptiness, loneliness, hopelessness (""I don't think I'll ever find my soulmate""), and a loss of will to live. It explicitly mentions ""want to die"" in the context of relationship rejections and mental health struggles.
   - There are no references to death, dying, suicide, or self-harm methods (e.g., pills, weapons). No specific plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or locations are mentioned.
   - No past actions or attempts (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are described; the focus is on current feelings.
   - The temporal context is general, with no indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is stated directly (""want to die"") but is contextualized as stemming from distress over not having a boyfriend, and there is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it includes explicit expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I've lost all will to live"" and ""want to die""). These indicate a personal wish not to be alive.
   - There is no negation or indication that these thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no disclaimers like ""I don't want these thoughts""). The framing suggests genuine distress and a current desire, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The content focuses solely on emotional state and thoughts without any planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no references to past or recent actions. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal behavior (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal expression of a desire to die (""want to die,"" ""lost all will to live"") meets the criteria for 'Ideation' as it conveys suicidal thoughts without any plan, method, or preparation.
   - It does not qualify as 'Indicator' because there is a clear, current desire to die, not just abstract distress or unwanted thoughts.
   - It does not meet 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan or method.
   - It does not meet 'Attempt' because no past or recent self-initiated action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions death and suicide explicitly with phrases like ""my death"" and ""off myself,"" indicating personal suicidal intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't want to live anymore,"" ""i cant keep living with depression"") and concern about being a burden (""i don't want to ruin my mum's mental state"").
   - There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). ""Off myself"" is a general term for suicide but lacks detail.
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present; the focus is on current feelings and future intentions.
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the phrase ""when i off myself"" suggests a general future intent, while ""i can't continue to live for decades to come"" implies a longer-term struggle.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""I don't want to live anymore"") but with ambivalence due to concern for their mother. There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide with ""off myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die with ""I don't want to live anymore."" There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't actually want to die""), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator.'

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. ""Off myself"" is a vague colloquialism for suicide and does not constitute a plan. With no explicit plan/method, this points to 'Ideation.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts and future intentions but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires a lack of current personal desire).
   - There is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior.'
   - No concrete, initiated suicidal action is described, so it is not an 'Attempt.'
   - The content aligns with 'Ideation' due to the clear expression of suicidal desire without specific plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions severe distress: ""mentally ill,"" ""can't afford treatment,"" financial struggles, hopelessness (""what's the fucking point"").  
   - Explicitly states suicidal intent: ""just killing myself"" and links it to despair (""what's the point in not"").

   - No past suicidal actions or attempts referenced.  
   - Temporal context is future-oriented (""i'm going to end up... killing myself""), not imminent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly states ""killing myself"" with no negation of desire.

   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes a quote from the author's mother (""You look like you're about to die"") and the author's response: ""Yeah no shit mom, I am depressed af and tried to kms yesterday, what do you want from me?""
   - Key elements:
     - Explicit mention of suicide: ""kms"" is shorthand for ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
     - Emotional indicators: ""depressed af"" shows despair and hopelessness.
     - References to past actions: ""tried to kms yesterday"" describes a specific, self-initiated action that was potentially lethal, occurring in the recent past (yesterday). The word ""tried"" implies the action was initiated but not completed (e.g., interrupted, failed, or stopped).
     - No mention of current suicidal desire, plans, methods, or preparations; the focus is solely on the past event.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide with ""tried to kms"" (kill myself), indicating a clear past desire to die from the author. There is no statement negating or expressing unwanted thoughts (e.g., no indication that the author currently does not want these thoughts).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The post does not specify a method, plan, or preparation for the past action (e.g., no details on how the attempt was made). However, since the analysis is centered on the described action, this step is less critical for categorizing a past event as 'Attempt'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to kms yesterday."" This indicates a concrete, potentially lethal action initiated by the author, which qualifies as a suicide attempt under the 'Attempt' definition. The action was recent (yesterday) and self-initiated, even if it failed or was interrupted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The core of the post is the disclosure of a past suicide attempt (""tried to kms yesterday""), which aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition: a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is explicit personal suicidal intent (past action), not just general distress. It is not 'Ideation' because it involves a described action, not just thoughts or desire. It is not 'Behavior' because there is no current plan or preparation mentioned; the post focuses on a past attempt. Under the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when a concrete past action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""I cant fight anymore""), despair (""non stop pain and suffering for 28 years""), and a sense of being overwhelmed (""I cant live anymore"").  
   - The phrase ""There has to be a non painful way to do this"" is ambiguous but could imply suicidal ideation. However, ""do this"" is not explicitly defined as suicide.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, preparations (e.g., notes), locations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - The core sentiment is a desire to escape suffering, culminating in ""I cant live anymore,"" which explicitly states a wish to not continue living.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The post does **not** explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent direct phrases.  
   - However, it includes a clear personal desire to die or not be alive (""I cant live anymore""). This is not framed as an unwanted thought (e.g., no language like ""I don’t want to feel this way"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is described. The vague reference to a ""non painful way"" is insufficient to indicate a concrete plan or method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current emotional suffering and a desire to end life but **no past or recent suicidal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to not live (""I cant live anymore"") moves this beyond general distress (which would be 'Indicator').  
   - Without any mention of a plan, method, or preparation, it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.  
   - No description of a past/current self-initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The unambiguous personal expression of a wish to die, absent a plan, aligns with **'Ideation'**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""do it"" (contextually meaning suicide).  
   - Desire: Clear personal wish to die (""I want to kill myself"").  
   - Method: ""with drugs"" (specific means).  
   - Preparation: ""write a suicide note"" (explicit preparation step).  
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""next week"").  
   - No past actions described; focus is on future plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly states ""I want to kill myself."" No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (""drugs"") and explicit preparation (""write a suicide note"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""next week""), not past actions. No initiated lethal action mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** (rules out 'Indicator').  
   - **Specific method (drugs) and preparation (suicide note)** confirm 'Behavior' (rules out 'Ideation').  
   - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** (rules out 'Attempt').

58,"i'm always tired. i'm so tired. life is so cyclic. i need to be in college for so long to have my 'dream job' and i have no motivation. there's always the chance i'll give up because that's what i do. i'm tired of being sick and pushing everyone away, saying hurtful things to people and immediately regretting it because i'm ill. none of the pills do enough and i'm almost out of ones to try, and i'm tired of working 40 hours a week to barely pay my bills. where is the motivation to keep up my grades supposed to come from? i don't have enough money to give my boyfriend the life i want to give him and i don't have a family. it's so lonely. my best friend has this beautiful loving family. she told me about the christmas dinner she's going to have and i'm so jealous. it sounds so wonderful. i'm not doing anything. i'll probably get some fast food like i did on thanksgiving. i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""life is so cyclic,"" ""i'm tired of being sick,"" ""it's so lonely""), despair over life circumstances (financial stress, academic pressure, strained relationships), and anhedonia (""i have no motivation"").  
   - Mentions of pills (""none of the pills do enough"") relate to treatment frustration, not suicidal means.  
   - The phrase ""i'm ready to get this over with soon. its long overdue"" suggests a desire to end suffering but lacks specificity about suicide/death.  
   - No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - No descriptions of past suicidal actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die.""  
   - ""Get this over with"" implies exhaustion with life but **does not explicitly state a desire to die**. The vagueness leans away from suicidal intent.  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"") is present, but the absence of explicit suicidal language is notable.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method** (e.g., pills as means, weapons) or **preparations** (e.g., notes, goodbyes) mentioned.  
   - Pills are referenced in the context of ineffective treatment, not as a suicidal tool.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current emotional distress** and life frustrations.  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress and hopelessness** without explicit personal desire to die.  
   - Ambiguous phrasing (""get this over with"") lacks suicidal specificity, aligning with **Indicator** (general distress, no clear intent).  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior* or *Attempt*.  
   - No explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") supports *Indicator* over *Ideation*.

59,"I finally went through. I regret everything that led me to this point. I have overdosed. I regret it. I also don't. I don't want to die, I just want my suffering to be over. I took 500mg Zoloft, so it won't kill me, but it'll punish me for being such a nuisance to society. It hasn't been that long, but I'm getting a headache and some other bullshit. I'm sorry.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft,"" indicating a specific method (overdosing on medication). Emotional indicators include regret, suffering, feeling like a ""nuisance to society,"" and a desire for suffering to end. The writer states, ""I don't want to die,"" but the action has already occurred (""it hasn't been that long""). The overdose is described as a past/recent event with physical symptoms (headache), confirming initiation of the act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""overdosed"" implies a suicidal act. The writer explicitly negates a desire to die (""I don't want to die""), framing it as an escape from suffering. However, the action taken (overdose) indicates intent to self-harm, which aligns with suicidal behavior despite the stated lack of death wish.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned: overdosing on 500mg Zoloft. The act has been carried out (""I took""), so preparation and execution are implied. This goes beyond mere planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past/recent action: ""I have overdosed"" and ""I took 500mg Zoloft"" occurred before the post. This is a concrete, self-initiated act that was potentially lethal (even if the writer believes it ""won't kill me,"" an overdose carries risk). The symptoms (headache) indicate the action is ongoing/recent. This fits the 'Attempt' category, as it involves an initiated, potentially lethal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of a specific, initiated action (overdose) rules out 'Indicator' (general distress without action) and 'Ideation' (thoughts without plan/action). While a method is mentioned, the action has been taken, so it is not just 'Behavior' (planning/preparation without initiation). The description of a past/recent self-initiated act aligns with 'Attempt', even if it failed or was non-lethal, and the writer's mixed feelings (""I regret it. I also don't"") do not change this classification. The 'Attempt' category takes precedence due to the concrete action described.

60,"I'm doing it in the near future. I feel so at peace right now, knowing I'm going to. I've spent some good time with my favourite person over the weekend and now I think I'm ready to go. I'm ready.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains phrases like ""I'm doing it,"" ""knowing I'm going to,"" and ""I'm ready to go,"" which imply a reference to suicide, though euphemistic. Emotional indicators include a sense of resolve and peace (""I feel so at peace,"" ""I think I'm ready""), suggesting acceptance of death. Spending time with a favorite person may hint at preparatory behavior (e.g., saying goodbye), but it's not explicitly stated as such. No specific methods, tools, locations, or substances are mentioned. The timing ""in the near future"" indicates imminence but lacks immediacy (e.g., not ""tonight""). The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication of unwanted thoughts or distress about the decision.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Suicide or death is not explicitly named (e.g., no ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""), but phrases like ""I'm doing it"" and ""ready to go"" strongly imply a personal desire to die in context. The author does not negate or express distress about these thoughts; instead, they convey resolve. Thus, there is an explicit intent, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or detailed plan is mentioned. The reference to spending time with a favorite person could be interpreted as implicit preparation (e.g., farewell), but it is not explicit (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means, or concrete steps). Without a clear plan, method, or preparation, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. Ambiguity here favors 'Ideation' per the rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions (""in the near future"") with no description of past or recent actions. There is no mention of initiated suicidal acts (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm doing it,"" ""ready to go""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or explicit preparation means it does not qualify for 'Behavior' (e.g., no details on how, where, or with what). The resolved emotional tone and implied intent distinguish this from 'Indicator', which lacks genuine suicidal desire. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. Per the rules, if no plan/method is present, 'Ideation' is appropriate, and ambiguity favors 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions a past state of being suicidal (""i was suicidal"") but does not express any current suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include frustration with high school counselors and reflection on a negative past experience, but no current hopelessness, despair, or anhedonia.
   - No specific plans, methods, means, or preparations for suicide are mentioned for the past or present.
   - The reference to being suicidal is from four years ago and describes an event where the school responded poorly, but it does not detail any concrete suicidal actions taken at that time (e.g., no mention of an attempt, method, or initiation of self-harm).
   - There is no imminence or current intention indicated; the focus is on recounting a past incident.
   - The writer's current sentiment is distress about the past event, not a present desire to die or act on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""i was suicidal,"" but this is in the past tense and refers to a historical state, not a current expression. There is no direct phrase like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"" in the present context.
   - The writer does not express a current desire to die; instead, they are reflecting on a past experience with frustration.
   - The suicidal thoughts mentioned are from the past and are not described as unwanted in the present, but the lack of current suicidal expression means there is no genuine present desire to die. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the past or present suicidal state. The post only states ""i was suicidal"" without elaboration on plans or actions.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are present.
   - Without any plan or method indicated, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event from four years ago. It references being suicidal but does not describe any initiated suicidal action (e.g., no mention of taking pills, self-harm, or an attempt that was stopped). The phrase ""found out i was suicidal"" suggests the school became aware of suicidal ideation, not a concrete action.
   - There is no description of a past or recent potentially lethal action, so it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress and reflects on past suicidal ideation but lacks a current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. The mention of past suicidal thoughts is historical and not presented as a current issue.
   - Since there is no explicit current suicidal desire, plan, method, or preparation, and the suicidal reference is ambiguous in terms of action (leaning toward thoughts rather than behavior), this fits 'Indicator' per the definition: ""expresses general distress... or discusses suicide abstractly, but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die."" 
   - Rule: If in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator'. Here, the past context and absence of current intent support 'Indicator'.

But I know for a fact that **nothing will make me happier. Not even love, being rich, surrounded by loving friends and family, being smart/goodlooking enough for my own liking. Nothing will.**. And me being sad is dangerous. It's bad. I'm just a pretty shit person in general. Even when I'm happy I sound insane. Maybe I really am? I'm just trying to be kind, not selfish, considerate. I'm trying to fix things and they still manage to fall apart. Might as well just die.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes direct mentions of suicide (""Should I just go and kill myself?"" and ""Might as well just die""), expressing a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators are strong, with hopelessness (""nothing will make me happier""), despair (""unexplainable void and sadness""), anhedonia (inability to feel happiness from love, wealth, etc.), and feelings of being a burden (""I'm just a pretty shit person""). There is no mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timelines (e.g., ""tonight""). The author discusses recurring sadness and panic attacks but does not reference any past suicidal actions or attempts. The desire to die is expressed as a genuine consideration, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die through phrases like ""Might as well just die,"" indicating personal suicidal intent. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., the author does not state these thoughts are unwanted).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned. The references to suicide are general (e.g., ""kill myself,"" ""die"") without details on how, when, or where. This absence means the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on current emotional distress and suicidal thoughts, with no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interruptions, or failures). The recurring sadness (""not the first time, not the last one"") refers to emotional states, not concrete suicidal behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""die"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of clear suicidal intent. The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No description of initiated actions rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation', as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without specifics on planning or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I had made up my mind to kill myself"" and ""I have prepared everything,"" indicating a personal desire to die and concrete preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I am just rubbish""), burden perception (""they have to support me""), and despair (""I hate my family I have no friends"").  
   - Specific suicidal intent is present (""kill myself""), alongside confirmation of preparations (""prepared everything"").  
   - No description of a past/initiated action (e.g., ""I tried"")—only stated intent and readiness.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""kill myself"" is a direct phrase.  
   - Yes: Desire to die is explicit (""i should die,"" ""made up my mind to kill myself"").  
   - No negation of desire—thoughts are endorsed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method implied (""kill myself"") but not specified; however, **preparations are explicitly confirmed** (""I have prepared everything"").  
   - This qualifies as ""Behavior"" per guidelines (preparations mentioned).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **future intent** (""made up my mind a few days [ago]"") and current readiness (""prepared everything"").  
   - **No description of a past/initiated suicidal act** (e.g., ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + preparations = **Behavior**.  
   - Absence of initiated lethal action rules out ""Attempt.""  
   - Plan/preparation distinguishes it from ""Ideation.""

So I would want to vanish without a trace. Empty my bank account, leave most of my belongings to them, pick a direction, and start walking. No phone or car to trace me, just cash and a pair of shoes. Keep walking untill I find a secluded spot where no one will find my body. Only things I plan to have on me at the end are a pistol, a canteen, and the clothes on my back. As for my roommates, they're not dumb, they'll be able to put 2 and 2 together. But will most likely be unphased by the realization. I hope they enjoy my stuff, cuz they never seemed to enjoy my company.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and specifically includes ""a pistol"" as an intended means at the end. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I will have nothing to look forward to""), feeling like a burden (""roommates will be tired of my presence""), and perceived lack of value (""they never seemed to enjoy my company""). There is a clear plan: emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, walking to a secluded spot with a pistol. Preparations are implied (e.g., leaving belongings, planning to have only essentials). The desire is to die, as indicated by the pistol and secluded spot. No past actions are described; this is future-oriented and contingent on being asked to leave.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it strongly implies death through ""vanish without a trace,"" ""no one will find my body,"" and the pistol reference. There is a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I would want to vanish"" in this context). Suicidal thoughts are not presented as unwanted; instead, they are part of a desired plan. Thus, explicit intent is present, leaning away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""a pistol"" for the end goal. Preparations are detailed, such as emptying the bank account, leaving belongings, and planning to have only cash and shoes. The plan includes walking to a secluded spot to ensure the body isn't found. This indicates concrete planning elements, so it leans toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""When that happens I will..."") and hypothetical actions, not past or recent events. No initiated action (e.g., a past attempt) is mentioned; everything is prospective. Thus, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a personal desire to die (suicidal ideation) combined with specific plans (vanishing, walking to a secluded spot) and a method (pistol). Preparations like financial and belongings arrangements are part of the plan. This fits 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts with plan/method). It is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit desire to die, not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan/method, and not 'Attempt' because no action has been initiated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit statement: ""I want to die.""
   - Strong emotional distress: hopelessness (""life is shit,"" ""I give up now""), feeling uncared for (""no one cares""), identity loss (""I don’t recognise myself anymore"").
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Temporal context: Expressions are current (""now,"" present tense) but lack imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete plans.
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (""I want to die""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""I want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal desire.
   - No negation (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.
   - Vague urgency (""I’m this fucking close"") implies distress but not a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").
   - Focus is on current emotional state and desire, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: ""I want to die"" confirms a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires absence of genuine suicidal intent).
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, so it cannot be 'Behavior'. Urgency without specificity leans toward 'Ideation'.
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/current initiated actions.
   - Conclusion: The post expresses a clear desire to die with suicidal thoughts but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. Falls under 'Ideation'.

Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions long-term suicidal feelings (""Ive been suicidal for about 10 years"") and a current desire to die (""i dont want the existance ive got"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, disconnection, self-perception as a burden, and isolation.  
   - **Specific plan/method/preparation**: The author details choosing a woodland location for suicide, planning to leave notes for dog walkers to warn them and call police, and deliberately pushing people away to facilitate the act.  
   - No past or recent *initiated* suicidal actions (e.g., no description of a prior attempt). Childhood self-harm is noted but not framed as a suicide attempt.  
   - Temporal context: Plans are described as current/recent (""ive recently decided,"" ""i will leave notes"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - **Yes**: Specific method/location (woodland), preparations (leaving notes for discovery), and deliberate isolation to enable the act.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current plans/preparations** but no past/ongoing *initiated lethal actions*. Childhood self-harm is unrelated to current suicide planning.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - No initiated action (e.g., no description of visiting the woodland or writing notes yet), so not **Attempt**.  
   - Plan details (location, notes, isolation strategy) exceed general **Ideation** and align with **Behavior**.

67,"I got my license but I'm not allow to drive anywhere, including work. A couple days ago, I passed my drivers test after having my license delayed for a whole year. I got it delayed due to paperwork which then affected me getting my permit. Basically, I got my license very late. I was obviously very joyful and happy that I was able to drive whenever and wherever, or so I thought. Nope, my moms still thinks I'm not ready to drive by myself and she says I have to wait up to a year because of insurance on the car and all that bullshit. Btw, she said I was gonna fail my test and was very discouraging towards me. So not only did she basically take my license away, she ruin my last summer before I turn a senior in high school. Now I'm not claiming I'm the best driver, but I'm not as bad as she thinks or anyone for that matter. What I find bullshit is she won't even let me take the car to work even though I live 2-3 minutes away from my work. She just has trust issues and selfish as a bitch. I'm so sick and tired because I worked my ass off, spent weeks and weeks practicing months leading up to this just to have a permit again. I hate my life, I wanna off myself. I wanted my license so I can have more freedom and to tell my friends I got it. But I guess I got everything taken away from me. This is complete bullshit, I don't even wanna live anymore . I fucking hate my mom and she is the worst thing that had ever happened to me.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""I hate my life, I wanna off myself"" and ""I don't even wanna live anymore.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I got everything taken away from me""), anger (""I fucking hate my mom""), and frustration.  
   - No specific plans, methods, locations, or preparations (e.g., no tools, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence: None stated (e.g., no ""today"" or ""soon"").  
   - Desire: Explicitly states a wish to die (""I wanna off myself""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, direct phrases: ""I wanna off myself"" (colloquial for suicide) and ""I don’t even wanna live anymore.""  
   - **Yes**, clear desire to die without negation (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a method, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current feelings** (e.g., anger at mother, frustration over license).  
   - **No** reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""last night I..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I wanna off myself"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation (rules out **Behavior**).  
   - No past/initiated lethal action (rules out **Attempt**).  
   - Intensity of distress and explicit suicidal intent distinguishes it from **Indicator** (where desire is absent/unwanted).

No one in my life cares. I have no one to talk to. I have no one to help me stay alive. No one in my life will miss me when I'm gone.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""suicidal at my age"" and ""tonight's the night I guess,"" indicating explicit suicidal thoughts and imminent intent.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""feeling kinda hopeless""), despair (""No one cares,"" ""no one to help me stay alive""), and feeling like a burden (""No one will miss me"").
   - There is a reference to seeking help (calling the hotline), but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) for suicide is mentioned.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""tonight's the night""), with no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed).
   - The writer expresses a desire for help to ""stay alive,"" showing ambivalence, but the overall tone confirms a current personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""suicidal"" and implies a desire to die with ""tonight's the night I guess"" in a context of despair.
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; the writer acknowledges them as part of their current state, with imminent intent overriding the expressed distress about lack of help.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no details on how the suicide would occur). ""Tonight's the night"" indicates timing but not a concrete plan or means.
   - Without explicit evidence of planning, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight's the night"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions. Calling the hotline is a help-seeking behavior, not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""suicidal,"" ""tonight's the night"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no clear current desire.
   - The absence of a specific method, plan, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires such details).
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated suicidal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': it expresses a clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but lacks any plan, method, or preparation.

69,"oxy and cutting an artery. wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain alot when cutting an artery?. im sorry if this isn't allowed here, i just don't know who else to ask",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific methods: ""oxy"" (likely OxyContin, a potent opioid) and ""cutting an artery.""  
   - Focuses on reducing pain during a lethal action (""wouldn't taking oxy lessen the pain""), indicating practical consideration of execution.  
   - Expresses distress/apology (""im sorry,"" ""don't know who else to ask"") but no negation of suicidal desire.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - However, the question about pain reduction during a *lethal action* (""cutting an artery"") implies a genuine desire to die by suicide. There is no statement rejecting the thoughts (e.g., ""I don’t want to do this"").  
   → **Suicidal desire is implicitly present**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method** is clearly stated: combining oxy use with arterial cutting.  
   - The post seeks logistical advice (""lessen the pain""), indicating active planning.  
   → **Explicit method and planning elements are present**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  
   - Focus is on future intent (""*wouldn't* taking oxy..."").  
   → **No evidence of an attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The combination of **implicit desire to die** + **explicit method** (oxy + arterial cutting) + **planning focus** (pain mitigation) fits **Behavior**.  
   - Not *Ideation* (method is specified) or *Attempt* (no action described).  
   - Not *Indicator* (desire is implied; method is concrete).

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument. The people in my life are used to me being a doormat and don't react well if I say I'm not happy about something. Am I justified in being hurt and upset about this? Or am I overreacting? What should I do?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post focuses on the user's distress over a friend's prediction that the user will die by suicide.  
   - Key elements:  
     - The friend stated, ""I'm positive I'm going to kill myself"" and would ""bet on it happening.""  
     - The user feels hurt, betrayed, and questions the friend's lack of faith.  
     - The user mentions having BPD and CPTSD but emphasizes efforts to ""fight my mental illness.""  
     - No explicit personal desire to die, suicide plans, methods, preparations, or past suicidal actions by the user.  
     - Emotional indicators: Hurt, frustration, and feeling invalidated, but not hopelessness or personal suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The user never expresses a personal desire to die, commit suicide, or be gone. Suicide is discussed only in the context of the friend’s prediction and the user’s distress about it. Phrases like ""I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness"" oppose personal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. There is no mention of the user considering a method, plan, or preparation for suicide. The post centers on interpersonal conflict.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No past or recent actions**. The user describes a past *conversation* with the friend but no self-initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no attempts, aborted actions, or preparations).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress about a friend’s hurtful comments and mental health struggles but lacks **personal** suicidal desire, plans, or actions.  
   - References to suicide are abstract (friend’s prediction) or hypothetical (""If I’d been diagnosed with cancer...""), not declarations of the user’s intent.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress about external perceptions of suicide risk without personal suicidal ideation/behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""jump out"" which implies suicide by jumping, and ""cut the screen"" with scissors, indicating a specific method and tool for self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include desperation (""please please please help me""), helplessness (""i dont know what to do""), and a sense of immediacy (""right now,"" ""im about to"").
   - There is a specific plan: cutting the screen with scissors to jump from the window, with real-time preparation (being at the window with the means).
   - The temporal context is current and imminent (""right now,"" ""about to""), but no description of a past or completed action.
   - The writer expresses distress and a plea for help, indicating ambivalence, but the description of being on the verge of acting shows a current suicidal crisis.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump out"" is a clear and strong implication of suicidal intent in this context.
   - It expresses a desire to act imminently (""im about to""), which shows a personal and current wish to die, despite the plea for help.
   - There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the focus is on the urge to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (jumping from a height) and means (scissors to cut the screen) are explicitly mentioned.
   - Preparation is evident: the writer is actively at the window with scissors, indicating immediate steps toward carrying out the act.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current intention (""im about to"") but no initiated action. The phrase ""feel like im about to"" suggests impending action that has not yet started.
   - There is no reference to a past or recent concrete suicidal action; this is all future-oriented.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent (implied by ""jump out"") and a specific plan/method/preparation (scissors, window) rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The detailed plan and real-time preparation elevate this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan).
   - Since no action has been initiated (e.g., cutting or jumping has not occurred), it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.
   - This aligns with 'Behavior': suicidal thoughts/desire with a clear plan, method, and immediate preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions a specific method: ""overdose on iron pills.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""i have pain everyday and i don't wanna deal with it"" reflects hopelessness and despair.  
   - Specific plan/method: ""overdose on iron pills"" is a concrete means.  
   - Imminence: ""gonna"" implies future intention but no explicit timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: The phrase ""i don't wanna deal with it"" coupled with the overdose plan indicates an active desire to escape pain through self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. ""overdose"" is a direct method of suicide, and the context (escaping chronic pain) confirms suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes. A specific method (""overdose on iron pills"") is explicitly stated. No explicit mention of preparations (e.g., possessing pills), but naming the method suffices for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Future intention (""gonna overdose""). No description of past/initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Explicit desire to die via a named method (overdose) meets 'Behavior' criteria.  
   - Not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit), not 'Ideation' (method is specified), not 'Attempt' (no initiated action described).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""im going to kill myself one day"" and expresses intense despair, hopelessness (""i feel like a failure who might as well die""), and a desire to escape (""i just want to disappear... run away to a forest and fucking die"").  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, timeline (beyond ""one day""), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The reference to ""run away to a forest and die"" is vague and lacks concrete details.  
   - The author mentions a protective factor (hope for college admission far away) but maintains a clear desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""im going to kill myself one day"" is an explicit, personal statement of suicidal intent. Phrases like ""i just want to disappear... and fucking die"" reinforce a desire to not be alive.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While ""run away to a forest and die"" implies a method, it is nonspecific (no tools, substances, or actionable steps) and lacks preparation. The timeline (""one day"") is indeterminate.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes future intent (""one day"") with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die meets the threshold for **Ideation**.  
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, preparation, or past/future-imminent action rules out *Behavior* or *Attempt*. General distress and protective factors are present but do not negate the expressed desire to die, so *Indicator* is inappropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including hopelessness (""losing more hope""), despair (""every single day is the same thing over and over""), anhedonia (""life is so sisyphean""), feelings of being a burden/defective (""how useless I am,"" ""defective and unfit to be alive""), and explicit suicidal ideation (""I hate being alive,"" ""wish so badly for me to get murdered,"" ""want to die""). 
   - **Crucially, the author explicitly states they lack the intent/ability to act on suicidal thoughts**: ""I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself,"" ""stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself."" 
   - Desires death via external means (murder, assisted suicide) but **no personal plan, method, or preparation** is described. Walking through sketchy areas is a passive hope, not a self-initiated plan. 
   - No past suicidal actions (attempts) are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the author expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die,"" ""end it all""). 
   - **However, they explicitly negate personal intent/action**: Suicidal thoughts are framed as *unwanted due to fear/cowardice*, with no current will to act. The desire for death is redirected toward passive external solutions (murder, assisted suicide).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No specific method, tools, locations (beyond vague ""sketchy areas""), or preparations for a *self-initiated* suicidal act are mentioned. 
   - References to murder/assisted suicide involve *hoping for external intervention*, not personal planning or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes ongoing emotional pain and passive wishes for death. 
   - **No description of past or recent self-initiated suicidal actions** (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm initiated). Mentions of walking in sketchy areas are hope-driven, not preparatory acts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core is **distress + explicit but *unwanted/unactionable* suicidal thoughts**. The author directly states they cannot act on their desire to die due to fear, placing this closer to ""distress about unwanted thoughts"" (Indicator) than actionable intent (Ideation/Behavior). 
   - While a strong desire to die is expressed, the *absence of a personal plan/method* and the *explicit rejection of self-harm capability* rules out Ideation (which requires actionable desire) and Behavior (which requires a plan). 
   - No past/current self-initiated lethal actions, so Attempt does not apply.  
   - **Conclusion**: Falls under **Indicator** due to the explicit framing of suicidal thoughts as unwanted/distressing but not actionable by the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions death/dying: ""I'm actually glad I'm going to die,"" ""I'll experience it painfully,"" ""See you all on the other side.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""8,000 fucking days of this shithole,"" ""I can't take no more""), feeling unwanted (""I always felt unwanted"").
   - Specific plan/method: None mentioned (no tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions like writing notes).
   - Imminence: Vague future intent (""I think I'm going to leave""), no time-bound urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""glad I'm going to die,"" ""going to leave"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. Direct expressions of personal desire to die (e.g., ""glad I'm going to die,"" ""going to leave"") without negation or distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No. While ""leave"" and ""other side"" imply suicide, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Future intention (""I think I'm going to leave""), but no description of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). The 8,000-day count is metaphorical, not an action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation mentioned, so 'Behavior' is not applicable.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/recent concrete action described.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post shows clear suicidal desire and hopelessness but lacks specificity of plan, method, or action. Fits 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including sadness, anxiety, depression, hopelessness (e.g., ""only feeling sadness and anxiety,"" ""my soul is hurting,"" ""it's just been out of my reach for beyond a decade""), feeling like a burden (""tired of being a burden to everyone""), and despair about coping (""I've tried every way to cope""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The phrase ""I just don't wanna be here"" and ""wave the white flag"" imply a desire to escape pain but are not explicit about suicide. Emotional indicators like hopelessness and anhedonia are present, but the writer also states a desire for happiness (""I still want happiness""). No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past suicidal actions are mentioned. The temporal context is ongoing distress with no imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer's desire focuses on relief from suffering rather than a clear wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. Phrases like ""I just don't wanna be here"" are vague and could indicate a wish to not exist, but they are not an explicit expression of a desire to die. The writer emphasizes wanting happiness and does not state any personal desire for death or suicide; instead, the distress centers on unwanted emotional pain. Therefore, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The discussion is about emotional struggles and failed coping mechanisms, not actionable suicidal behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past experiences with medication and coping but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interruptions, or failures). Statements like ""I've tried every way to cope"" refer to general coping strategies, not suicidal acts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows strong indicators of distress (hopelessness, burden, despair) but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. Ambiguous phrases like ""don't wanna be here"" do not explicitly convey a wish to die, especially when paired with the stated desire for happiness. With no plan, method, preparation, or past action, and given the ambiguity rule (choose 'Indicator' if unsure between Indicator and Ideation), 'Indicator' is the best fit. It does not meet the threshold for Ideation (which requires explicit suicidal thoughts) or higher categories.

   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts.
   - Temporal context: Urgency is implied (""right now,"" ""I have to do this""), but no specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") or imminent action details.
   - Desire to die is explicit and affirmed: Phrases like ""Death is my only option"" and ""It'd be worse staying alive"" convey a genuine wish to die, with no indication of resistance to the thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is described. The post focuses on intent and emotional state without detailing how, when, or where the act would occur.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""I have to do this"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt or interrupted behavior).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I have to kill myself"") rules out **Indicator** (which requires absence of personal suicidal intent).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior** (which requires explicit planning elements).
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.
   - The post fits **Ideation**: It expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I want to die"" equivalent) and suicidal intent but lacks specifics about means, plans, or preparations.

78,"I really, really wish lives were donate-able. Today, I met a guy on the internet of the same age as me. I learnt that he was suicidal like me some time ago, he lost his mother to cancer, got bullied, got kicked out of school because of a false accusation which stated that he was planning a rebellion and how they were making a very small amount of money. The guy is really nice, smart, and incredibly intelligent. Seriously, he is like a perfect combination for a 14-year-old boy. But his loss put a massive dent in his life. He is slowly recovering though. He doesn't deserve any of this. Not only that, but he deserves a much, much better life. I really wish I could somehow donate my life to his mother, so he could live the life he deserves. I don't deserve, nor want to live. But he does. I just wish I could donate my life, I would be making lots of people happy.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author expresses a strong wish to not be alive (""I don't deserve, nor want to live"") and repeatedly states a desire to ""donate"" their life to someone else, framing this as a solution to others' suffering.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (feeling undeserving of life), self-sacrifice (wishing to give life away), and worthlessness (""I don’t deserve... to live"").  
   - **No mention** of suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions. The language is hypothetical (""wish lives were donate-able"") and focused on altruistic self-erasure rather than active self-harm.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct equivalents.  
   - While ""I don’t want to live"" implies a desire not to exist, it is **couched in metaphorical/abstract terms** (""donate my life"") and lacks a clear expression of intent to *act* on this desire. The primary focus is on wishing for a hypothetical scenario, not personal suicidal action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or concrete steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **no past or recent actions**. The sentiment is entirely future-oriented and hypothetical.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment—unwillingness to live—could suggest ideation, but the **lack of explicit suicidal desire**, **abstract framing** (life donation), and **absence of personal intent to die by suicide** align more closely with **Indicator**. Key distinctions:  
     - ""I don’t want to live"" expresses distress and worthlessness but **not an active wish to die by suicide**.  
     - The metaphor of ""donating life"" distances the statement from direct suicidal ideation.  
     - Per guidelines: When ambiguous or lacking explicit suicidal desire, default to **Indicator**.

Soda and junk will kill me faster. Hope it all ends soon. Maybe I'll get lucky and get covid.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I'm ready to die,"" ""Hope it all ends soon.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""healing is a joke,"" ""therapy is a waste""), despair (""tired of it""), self-neglect (stopping meds, embracing unhealthy habits).  
   - Preparations: Stopping antidepressants, anti-anxiety, and blood pressure medications; quitting therapy. These could indirectly increase lethality but aren't explicit suicide preparations (e.g., stockpiling pills).  
   - Methods: Hopes passive means (""soda and junk,"" ""get covid"") will ""kill me faster,"" but no active plan/method (e.g., overdosing, jumping).  
   - Imminence: ""Today"" (for stopping meds), but no immediate timeline for suicide.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""ready to die,"" ""hope it all ends soon""), not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""I'm ready to die"" and ""hope it all ends soon"" express a clear personal desire to die. No negation of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Preparations: Stopping medications and quitting therapy could exacerbate risk but are not explicit suicide methods or plans (e.g., no mention of using meds for overdose).  
   - Methods: Hopes passive means (junk food, COVID) cause death, but this is vague and not a concrete plan. No tools/locations specified.  
   - **No explicit plan or method**; actions are framed as giving up, not active suicide steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future intentions (stopping meds ""today,"" quitting therapy).  
   - **No past or recent initiated suicidal action** (e.g., no ""I tried X"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""ready to die"") confirms *Ideation*, not general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No specific plan/method (e.g., ""I will use X to kill myself""). Stopping meds is self-neglect, not suicide preparation. Passive hopes (COVID/junk food) lack intent to act.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated lethal action.  
   - **Conclusion**: Strong desire to die with no plan/preparations → **Ideation**.

80,I just want to disappear. Please I just want to the broken remainings of my soul to be free from all this pain,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post expresses a strong desire to ""disappear"" and be ""free from all this pain."" It mentions emotional suffering (""broken remainings of my soul,"" ""pain"") but lacks explicit references to suicide, death, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators: Clear hopelessness and despair are present.  
   - Explicit suicide/death intent? **No direct phrases** (e.g., ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""die"") or unambiguous desire to die. ""Disappear"" implies escapism but is not inherently suicidal.  
   - Plan/method/preparation? **None mentioned**.  
   - Temporal context/action? Describes current emotional state; **no past actions or imminent intentions** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit mention** of suicide or death-related terms.  
   - ""Want to disappear"" and ""free from pain"" suggest distress but **do not clearly express a desire to die**. The phrasing leans toward metaphorical escape rather than literal suicide.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No tools, locations, timelines, or preparations referenced.  

4. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks a personal, explicit desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - Without clear suicidal intent, plan, or action, it does not meet criteria for *Ideation*, *Behavior*, or *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses emotional agony and a wish to escape pain, but suicidal intent is ambiguous/unstated.

81,Why shouldn't I kill myself!. Read through most of my posts and you'll know me better or chat with me if you want. Goodnight. Ps: I just need a plan for suicide,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, as seen in the rhetorical question ""Why shouldn't I kill myself!"" which implies a lack of reasons to live.
   - The PS states, ""I just need a plan for suicide,"" showing the author is considering planning but does not specify any method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or describe preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - There are no references to past actions, such as previous attempts or initiated behaviors.
   - No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated; ""Goodnight"" is a sign-off.
   - The author expresses a desire related to suicide without stating that the thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" showing a clear personal desire to die.
   - There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author is resisting them; instead, the author is actively seeking a plan.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""I just need a plan"" indicates consideration of future planning but does not describe an existing plan, method, or preparatory actions.
   - Since no explicit plan/method is present, this points away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current thoughts and future intentions (e.g., needing a plan) but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I did"" statements).
   - There is no evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action having been taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of current personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires an explicit plan/method).
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses a clear desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no plan, method, or preparations.

82,"I need to find someone who relates. Does anyone else find themselves almost uncontrollably saying ""I'm going to kill myself""? I say other things like ""I wish I stayed in the car"" (relating to my most recent failed attempt) and ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"". It's almost like Tourettes but I know it's not. I also find myself putting a finger gun in my mouth and pretending to blow my brains out. am I crazy or can anyone else relate?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: The post describes **uncontrollable verbalizations** of suicidal phrases (""I'm going to kill myself,"" ""I'm gonna hurt myself really badly"") and **compulsive gestures** (finger gun to mouth simulating suicide). It references a **past failed suicide attempt** (""my most recent failed attempt"" linked to ""I wish I stayed in the car""). The author frames these as involuntary, distressing symptoms (""almost like Tourettes,"" ""am I crazy?""), seeking validation from others.  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress, confusion, and helplessness about intrusive thoughts/actions.  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The past attempt is referenced but not elaborated as an imminent threat.  
   - Imminence: No current timeframe for action (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire: The author explicitly positions suicidal phrases/gestures as **unwanted and involuntary** (""uncontrollably,"" ""like Tourettes""), indicating distress about symptoms rather than a current desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""I'm going to kill myself"" are present but are described as **uncontrollable utterances**, not expressions of genuine intent. The author states these thoughts/actions feel compulsive and unwanted, comparing them to a neurological disorder. This leans toward 'Indicator' due to the explicit negation of volition.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The finger gun gesture is a simulation, not a concrete plan involving means (e.g., acquiring a real weapon). The past attempt is referenced but does not indicate ongoing preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **past attempt** (implied by ""failed attempt"" and regret about survival) but focuses primarily on **current involuntary symptoms**. The past action was concrete but is historical; the post’s emphasis is on present distress about intrusive thoughts/behaviors, not active suicidal action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is **distress about unwanted, compulsive suicidal expressions** (verbal and gestural), not a current desire to die. This aligns with 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts without personal intent).  
   - While a past attempt is mentioned, the primary content is about involuntary symptoms, not ongoing ideation/planning. 'Attempt' applies only if the focus is on the past action, but here the attempt is secondary to describing current psychological distress.  
   - No plan/method/preparation exists for current suicide, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Ideation'. Ambiguity about suicidal desire favors 'Indicator' per rules.

83,"I Hate Being Ugly. People are condescending and mean toward me, treat me as inferior and expect me to accommodate them, treat interacting with me like doing charity work, and are quick to criticize my flaws despite the fact that none of it will ever directly or indirectly affect them. I genuinely do not want to live anymore. Being treated this way feels so terrible to the point where I'm angry and suicidal. The only time people treat me humanely is when I'm wearing my mask and it hit me recently how subhuman I was treated growing up. I have a weird face and I look fairly attractive/cute with my mask on (as my eyes are considered very pretty and I have a nice nose bridge but the lower half of my face is very unappealing) and people are very kind, sympathetic, and receptive toward me when they don't have to see my face without a mask. I don't know how to deal with this problem as I do not have the money for plastic surgery. I've basically been abused my entire life (from abusive family to being bullied in school) and I'm very sick of it. I was socially inept for the longest time ever because people would just ignore me. Girls and guys. I hate my life. I've lost all my sanity and I don't know what to do.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - **Key Elements:** The post expresses intense distress about appearance-based mistreatment, lifelong abuse, and social isolation. Phrases like ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal"" explicitly reference suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I hate my life""), despair (""lost all my sanity""), and feeling subhuman. No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), timelines (""tonight""), or past/future actions are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and the *desire* to escape suffering, not concrete plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes:** The author states, ""I genuinely do not want to live anymore"" and ""I'm angry and suicidal."" These are direct expressions of a personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"") to suggest the thoughts are unwanted without intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No:** No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are referenced. The mention of lacking money for plastic surgery relates to distress about appearance, not suicide planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **No:** The post describes chronic emotional pain and past abuse/bullying but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm). The phrase ""I'm angry and suicidal"" describes a current emotional state, not an initiated act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""do not want to live anymore"") and direct admission of being ""suicidal"" indicate **Ideation**.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out **Behavior**.
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.
   - While distress and hopelessness are severe, the explicit personal suicidal intent moves this beyond **Indicator**.

**Conclusion:** Fits **Ideation** (explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts, no plan/method/preparation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""endless torment,"" ""my life now? Spending day after day at home by myself"") and isolation (abandonment by friends, lack of social connection).
    - Explicitly states: ""I'd rather kill myself now than endure another day of this seemingly endless torment."" This is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
    - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., no pills, location, note-writing).
    - No past actions or attempts are described. The focus is on current feelings and a future-oriented desire to escape suffering.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
    - **Yes**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly used, confirming a personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to"") or framing of thoughts as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
    - **No**: While suicidal intent is clear, no method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The statement is a declaration of preference (""I’d rather"") without actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
    - Describes **current/future intention** (""I'd rather kill myself now"") but **no past or recent concrete action** (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
    - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out *Indicator*.
    - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*.
    - No description of a past/initiated lethal action rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I want to kill myself"" and describes urges to ""blow my brains out"" (specific method: firearm).  
   - Emotional indicators include fear, guilt (""too much of a pussy""), attachment barriers (cats/friends), and persistent unwanted urges.  
   - A method (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"") is mentioned, but **no plan, preparation, or acquisition of means** is described (e.g., no gun possession, location, or timeline).  
   - The writer explicitly states they cannot act on urges (""can never bring myself to actually do it""), framing the thoughts as distressing but resisted.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described—only thoughts and urges.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" and ""urge to just blow my brains out"" indicate a personal desire to die. However, this is countered by stated fear, reluctance, and inability to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method mentioned**: Firearms (""blow my brains out,"" ""pull the trigger"").  
   - **No plan/preparation**: No evidence of access to a gun, steps taken, or timeline (e.g., ""tonight""). The method is referenced hypothetically within urges, not as part of a concrete plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing urges and thoughts** (""every single day,"" ""lay in bed at night"") but **no initiated action**. The writer explicitly states they have not acted (""can never bring myself to actually do it"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Method is mentioned, but no plan/preparation** → Leans toward *Ideation* (per rules: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation'"").  
   - **No past/current action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Key nuance**: The method is embedded in descriptions of urges/resistance, not actionable planning. The dominant theme is *unwanted intrusive thoughts with desire to die but inability to act*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post includes direct pleas for death (""kill me"", ""murder me"", ""end my horrible life"") and indicates preparation by offering to DM an address. There is no mention of past actions, but the language conveys intense despair and a current desire for death.  
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill me"" and ""end my horrible life"" explicitly express a personal desire to die.  
3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The request to ""dm the address"" implies a specific method (having someone murder them) and shows preparation (providing location access).  
4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes a future-oriented plea (""please come here""), not a past or recent initiated action. No concrete suicidal act (e.g., self-harm) is described.  
5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""crushed and empty,"" ""false hope,"" ""too hard,"" and hopelessness about future happiness.  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts get stronger and stronger,"" confirming active personal suicidal ideation.  
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, location), or preparation (e.g., note, means) is described.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are disclosed.  
   - The phrase ""help me please"" and the focus on distress suggest ambivalence but do not negate the expressed desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states they have ""suicidal thoughts"" that are intensifying. The context (despair, hopelessness) frames these as personal desires, not abstract/unwanted thoughts.

   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""planning to kill myself tonight.""
   - Emotional indicators: Isolation (""Everyone is asleep""), perceived burden (""This is my problem... it's on me""), and farewell (""Rest In Peace ya'll"").
   - Specific temporal context: Imminent timeframe (""tonight"").
   - No explicit method/preparation details (e.g., tools, location), but clear intent and plan timing.
   - Desire to die is explicit and not negated (no indication of unwanted thoughts).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrase ""kill myself"" and contextual desire to die (farewell, taking responsibility).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Plan indicated**: ""planning to kill myself tonight"" specifies imminent timing. Though no method is detailed, temporal planning (""tonight"") qualifies as a preparatory element per guidelines. No explicit method (e.g., pills, weapon), but intent + timeframe leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes a **future intention** (""tonight""), not a past/recent initiated action. No evidence of concrete past attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + temporal plan (""tonight"") fits 'Behavior' (plan/preparation element). Absence of method specifics is mitigated by clear planning language and imminence. Not 'Attempt' (no action initiated), not 'Ideation' (plan present), not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit and current).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""suicide"" directly and frames it as the only solution (""suicide is the only thing that even come close to sufficing"").  
   - Strong emotional indicators: guilt (""make myself suffer extraordinary pain""), hopelessness (""I don't belong here""), and a desire to escape (""I need to leave"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - Focuses on current thoughts (""I'm starting to think"") with no reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - The phrase ""need to leave"" implies a desire to end existence but lacks concrete plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and frames it as necessary.  
   - **Yes**: Expresses a desire to escape/not exist (""I need to leave,"" ""I don't belong here"").  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: Mentions suicide abstractly but no specifics (how, when, tools).  
   - ""Need to leave"" is metaphorical, not a literal plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current thoughts** (""starting to think""), not past actions.  
   - No initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Clear desire to die (""suicide is the only thing,"" ""I need to leave"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No plan/method → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, but no plan/preparation.

91,"I've been practicing hanging myself and I can't wait for the day when I finally do it. My life is fucked now. There's no turning it around. I'm just worthless trash who deserves to die. No one is going to convince me otherwise. But yeah I practiced and there was no pain really. I'm going to keep practicing, train myself to break this natural survival instinct my body has and I will succeed. The thought makes me so happy. Thinking of death is the only thing that makes me happy. I take great solace knowing that this pain and this fucking shit life will be over soon. I'm saying this on reddit because if I were to share this with people in real life they'd try to stop me and I don't want anyone to take this away from me.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post explicitly mentions ""hanging myself"" as a specific suicide method and describes active ""practicing"" and ""training"" to overcome survival instincts. 
    - Strong emotional indicators include worthlessness (""worthless trash""), hopelessness (""no turning it around""), and explicit anticipation (""can't wait,"" ""makes me so happy"").
    - Specific preparations are detailed: practicing the method, training to suppress instincts, and secrecy to prevent intervention.
    - The desire to die is clear and affirmed (""I will succeed,"" ""take great solace"" in death). No ambivalence or rejection of suicidal thoughts is expressed.
    - Imminence is implied (""will be over soon""), but no exact timeline is given.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **Yes**. Phrases like ""hanging myself,"" ""do it,"" and ""death"" are direct. The writer’s desire to die is unambiguous and embraced.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **Yes**. ""Hanging"" is the explicit method. Active ""practicing,"" ""training,"" and efforts to bypass survival instincts constitute concrete preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes ongoing preparation (""practicing,"" ""going to keep practicing"") for a future act. No mention of a past or recent *initiated lethal action* (e.g., an interrupted/aborted hanging). The focus is on rehearsal, not execution.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Behavior**: The post expresses a clear desire to die (beyond 'Indicator') and details both a method (hanging) and active preparations (practicing/training). This meets the threshold for 'Behavior'. While rehearsal is described, no concrete *initiated action* (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself yesterday"") is present, ruling out 'Attempt'.

I am on the edge and if not tonight one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""I want to die. I want to disappear."" and ""one day i will take myself away from here so i can't hurt anyone.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong guilt (""piece of shit,"" ""feel like absolute shit""), self-loathing (""I hate people who yell... and I am one of them""), hopelessness (""all I can think of""), fear of harming others (""I feel like one day I will hurt someone""), and feeling like a burden (""take myself away... so I can't hurt anyone"").
   - Plans/methods/preparations: No specific suicide method, tool, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The phrase ""take myself away"" is vague and does not imply a concrete plan.
   - Past actions: Describes snapping at the dog (aggression, not self-harm) but no past or recent suicidal actions.
   - Imminence: ""if not tonight one day"" suggests non-immediate intent.
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""I want to die"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: Direct phrases like ""I want to die"" and ""take myself away"" (in context of escaping life) express a clear, personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No: No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations are described. The language (""take myself away"") is ambiguous and lacks actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Future intention (""one day i will"") but no description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions. The aggression toward the dog is unrelated to self-harm.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") places this beyond 'Indicator'.
   - No mention of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of a past or recent concrete suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"") rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The core elements—explicit suicidal desire without specifics—fit 'Ideation'.

I don't have any purpose in life to be honest. I don't know what will i do after college. I feel like disapointment. That's all. I just needed to vent. Sorry for my english.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""I feel like trash,"" ""I don't want to exist,"" ""no purpose in life,"" ""feel like disappointment,"" and references to anxiety attacks.  
   - **Explicit denial of suicidal intent**: ""I'm not suicidal or something. I think that suicide is selfish.""  
   - No mentions of death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Focuses on hopelessness (""I don't know what to do anymore"") but frames ""not wanting to exist"" as distinct from active suicidal desire.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings since October lockdown, not imminent plans.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.  
   - ""I just don't want to exist"" expresses despair but is **immediately negated** by the denial (""I'm not suicidal"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **explicitly rejected** as unwanted (""suicide is selfish"").  
   → **Leans toward 'Indicator'**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   → **No evidence for 'Behavior'**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  
   → **No evidence for 'Attempt'**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress/hopelessness (""don't want to exist""), but the author **explicitly disavows suicidal intent** and calls suicide ""selfish.""  
   - Without a clear, current desire to die or actionable plan, this aligns with **'Indicator'** (distress/unwanted thoughts without personal suicidal intent).  
   - Ambiguity between despair and active ideation is resolved by the direct denial, per rules: ""If in doubt [...] choose Indicator.""

94,"I dont think I've ever truly lived. I dont even know what it means to be alive. It just feels like im existing for the sake of existing. What is the definition of being alive? Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep existential despair, feelings of worthlessness, and societal disillusionment. Key suicidal elements include:  
     - Explicit desire: ""I dont know what I truly want besides death,"" ""The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating.""  
     - Past action: ""I attempted suicide last week,"" including details of drafting a note and the attempt failing.  
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""never-ending cycle of insanity""), perceived burden (""useless,"" ""no use to society""), and powerlessness.  
     - No specific future plan/method is mentioned for a new attempt, but the past attempt is described concretely.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The author explicitly states a desire for death (""I dont know what I truly want besides death"") and personalizes suicidal intent (""taking my own life"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No current plan/method** is indicated for future action. However, a **past attempt** is described with preparation (drafting a note) and initiation (the attempt itself).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **past, concrete, potentially lethal action**: ""I attempted suicide last week."" This action was initiated (""my attempt had failed"") and included preparatory steps (drafting a note). The failure does not negate the classification.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit description of a **past suicidal action** (""attempted suicide last week"") that was initiated and potentially lethal meets the definition of **Attempt**, regardless of current emotional state. While the author expresses ongoing ideation, the disclosure of a recent concrete attempt takes precedence per the rules.  
   - Contrasts:  
     - Not merely *Indicator* (desire to die is explicit).  
     - Not *Ideation* (goes beyond thoughts to described action).  
     - Not *Behavior* (focuses on past lethal action, not future planning).

95,How much valium does it take to kill you?. I'm afraid I haven't taken enough. I just want this nightmare to end,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill you"" in the context of a question about Valium dosage, indicating a specific method (Valium overdose). The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" suggests that the author has already ingested some Valium, implying a past or current action. ""I just want this nightmare to end"" expresses emotional distress, hopelessness, and a desire for relief, which could imply a wish to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to act on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly references suicide with ""kill you"" (understood as self-directed in context) and expresses a clear personal desire to end suffering (""I just want this nightmare to end""), which implies a wish to die. There is no negation or statement that these thoughts are unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (Valium overdose) is mentioned. Additionally, ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" indicates that preparations or actions have been taken (i.e., ingesting Valium), moving beyond mere planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The phrase ""I'm afraid I haven't taken enough"" describes a specific, self-initiated action (taking Valium) that has already occurred and is potentially lethal. This is not just a thought or plan but an initiated action, even if it may have been insufficient or interrupted. The concern about dosage suggests the action is recent or ongoing.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond general distress (Indicator) or mere desire to die (Ideation) because it includes a specific method and describes an initiated action. It also exceeds Behavior (which involves planning/preparation but not initiated action) because the author has taken a concrete step (ingesting Valium) with lethal intent. The description of a past/recent action that was potentially lethal aligns with the Attempt category, as it meets the criterion of a self-initiated, life-threatening act (even if it failed or was incomplete). The presence of current distress does not override the concrete action described.

96,"It's more than one miracle that I'm still living, yet I don't want to live at all. Not exaggerating, I keep cheating death and the most recent time didn't even have to do with suicide. I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly describes multiple past suicide attempts:  
     - At 16: Swallowed bottles of sleeping pills after writing a suicide note (hospitalized).  
     - November 2020: Cut neck with a razor (superficial injury).  
     - November 2020: Overdosed on prescription pills (survived).  
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses despair (""I don't want to live at all"") and references ""cheating death.""  
   - Methods/preparations are detailed (pills, razor, note).  
   - No current plan, method, or imminent intent described; focus is on past events.  
   - The motorcycle incident is framed as accidental, not suicidal.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I don't want to live at all"" and explicit labeling of past incidents as ""suicide attempts.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (pills, razor) and preparations (suicide note) are mentioned, but **only in the context of past attempts**. No current plan or preparation indicated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past, concrete suicidal actions** (initiated and potentially lethal):  
     - Pill overdose (hospitalized).  
     - Razor cut to the neck.  
     - Prescription cocktail overdose.  
   - These were physical acts with intent, even if they failed.  
   - No current/future actions described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly detailed, meeting the **Attempt** definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions [...] potentially lethal.""  
   - Current despair (""I don’t want to live"") suggests ongoing distress but does not override the precedence of described past attempts.  
   - **No ambiguity**: The post centers on recounting prior suicidal actions, not current ideation/planning.  

**Conclusion**: 'Attempt' is the correct category due to the focus on concrete past suicidal acts.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""I'm ready to be done,"" ""I put a belt around my neck,"" ""sat down against the doorknob,"" ""before I passed out, I stopped,"" ""I'm so close to just doing it.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (failing liver/marriage/business), despair (""ruin my life,"" ""fucking everything up""), burden (wife/kids/house loss).  
   - Specific method/preparation: Belt around the neck, using a doorknob for leverage.  
   - Action described: Initiated self-strangulation (""sat down... before I passed out""), then stopped.  
   - Imminence: ""Tonight,"" ""so close,"" ""push me one more inch.""  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""Tell me why I should [do it]""), no rejection of suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: Directly asks ""why I shouldn’t kill myself"" and states readiness to act.  
   - Yes: Expresses desire to die (""I'm ready to be done,"" ""push me one more inch"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (belt around neck, using doorknob) and recent preparation/action (""tonight"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a recent, initiated action: Placed belt, sat down, and nearly passed out before stopping. This is a concrete, potentially lethal act (strangulation) that was interrupted by self.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond ideation (desire to die) or behavior (plan/method) by describing a **self-initiated, potentially lethal action** that occurred recently (""tonight""). The act was interrupted but meets the criteria for 'Attempt' due to its concreteness and lethality risk.  
   - Rules: Past/recent suicidal actions take precedence over concurrent ideation/behavior.  
   - Distinction from 'Behavior': Behavior implies planning/preparation without initiated action. Here, action was initiated and interrupted.

98,scared. too scared to kill myself but too tired of life. plus suicide is illegal here so if i fail i might get arrested or fined for it . fun,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include ""scared,"" ""too tired of life,"" and hopelessness about their situation. There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparation (e.g., note-writing) described. The focus is on fear preventing action and the legal consequences of failing a suicide attempt. No past actions or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned. The writer states they are ""too scared to kill myself,"" which shows resistance to acting on suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase related to suicide.
   - The phrase ""too tired of life"" expresses a desire to not be alive, but it is coupled with ""too scared to kill myself,"" explicitly negating the intent to act. This indicates that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted, not a current personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The reference to suicide being ""illegal"" and the fear of arrest/fines are deterrents, not elements of a plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and fears but no past, recent, or future actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes explicit suicidal language (""kill myself"") but the writer clearly states they do not want to act due to fear (""too scared to kill myself""). This aligns with the 'Indicator' category, which includes expressions of distress or unwanted suicidal thoughts without a clear current desire to die. The lack of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No past or recent action rules out 'Attempt'. While ""too tired of life"" suggests ideation, the explicit resistance to acting makes 'Indicator' more appropriate, especially given the rule to choose 'Indicator' if there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire.

99,"Fuck this fucking world and the fucking people. We're all slaves to the fucking government working day in and day out for what? A few moments of happiness here and there? 12 years of required schooling only to be condemned to work the rest of our miserable lives most the time for paychecks barely enough to survive. This isn't fucking living. We are rotting away and people are acting indifferent to these facts. They consume the news and stuff of the media making themselves ignorant to the basic fact that human life has no fucking purpose other than living as a slave to make the rich richer and to slowly decay. We start dying the second we are born. This will be my second to last post. I'm taking a trip in April to end this bullshit for good. So stay tuned, it should be quite interesting.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions extreme hopelessness (""This isn't fucking living,"" ""rotting away,"" ""human life has no purpose""), despair about societal structures, and feeling trapped.
    - Explicit future intention to ""end this bullshit for good"" via a ""trip in April.""
    - No references to past suicide attempts or self-harm actions.
    - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or immediate preparations (e.g., writing a note) are described, but the ""trip"" implies a planned context for suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
    - **Yes**. ""End this bullshit for good"" is a clear euphemism for suicide, directly tied to the author's personal intent (""I'm taking a trip...""). The phrase ""second to last post"" also implies finality.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
    - **Yes**. While no specific tool/substance is named, the author references a concrete plan: a ""trip in April"" explicitly to ""end this."" This qualifies as a preparation (arranging a trip for suicide) and a temporal plan (""in April"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
    - Describes a **future intention** (April trip). No past/current suicidal actions are mentioned (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"" or ""I have pills now"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
    - The explicit desire to die (""end this bullshit for good"") and specific plan (""trip in April"") place this beyond *Indicator* (distress without suicidal desire) or *Ideation* (desire without plan).  
    - Lack of described past/current actions rules out *Attempt*.  
    - Falls under **Behavior** due to stated intent + preparations (organizing a trip for suicide).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""no motivation,"" ""fucked myself over,"" ""parents don't even care,"" ""no one left to turn to,"" emotional numbness (""blank"").  
   - **Explicit suicidal desire**: ""i just wish i could get hit by a car or od on meds or anything"" – expresses a clear *desire* for lethal outcomes.  
   - **Methods referenced**: ""hit by a car,"" ""od on meds"" (overdosing).  
   - **No plans/preparations**: No mention of acquiring means, writing notes, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **No past actions**: No description of initiated self-harm or suicide attempts.  
   - **Desire is active**: The phrasing (""i just wish"") indicates a current personal wish to die, not unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit desire for death via methods (""hit by a car,"" ""od on meds""). No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Methods mentioned**: Yes (""od on meds""), but **no plan/preparation** described (e.g., ""I have pills ready""). Methods are hypothetical wishes, not actionable plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No initiated actions**: Focuses on current despair/wishes; no past or recent suicide attempts described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""wish I could..."") rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Methods are referenced but **without specificity or preparation** (e.g., no ""I will OD *tonight*"" or ""I have the pills""). Thus, *Ideation* fits best.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No actionable plan or past attempt.

101,"If your attractive and you complain about how depressed you are, go fuck yourself. Call this gatekeeping depression I don't care, but if you're depressed as an attractive person go fuck yourself. You can't begin to imagine the daily torture of living life in an ugly person's body. Being unwanted in literally all facets of life from growing up to adulthood. If youre attractive the world is literally your oyster, I would never stop smiling I was born that way. I would fucking jump out of bed every morning because at least I have that because appearance, which is totally determined by chance, is the thing that has by far the biggest difference in ones life. I would give absolutely everything I own or ever will own to have been born that way",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger, frustration, and hopelessness related to perceived physical unattractiveness. Key phrases include ""daily torture of living life,"" ""being unwanted,"" and ""I would give absolutely everything... to have been born that way.""
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, preparations, or past actions. The phrase ""jump out of bed"" is metaphorical (energy/enthusiasm in a hypothetical scenario), not literal.
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair, envy, and feelings of being trapped by circumstance. However, these are framed as grievances about life inequality, not a personal desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No**. The post contains no direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die. The closest sentiment (""give everything to have been born attractive"") reflects a wish to *change life circumstances*, not end life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No references to plans, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **Not applicable**. The post describes ongoing distress and hypothetical wishes (""I would...""), with no description of past or imminent concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core content is **distress about life circumstances** (unattractiveness, social rejection) and resentment toward others. While despair is evident, there is **no personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action**. The intense emotion aligns with ""Indicator,"" which captures general distress without suicidal intent. Ambiguous phrasing (e.g., ""daily torture"") lacks suicidal specificity, reinforcing ""Indicator"" under the doubt rule.

102,'Just a phase'. Was told that me being suicidal is 'just a phase' because of my age despite me being abused and severely mentally ill. I've tried to kill myself 8 times. I'm tired of people's ignorance,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post mentions being suicidal and references past suicide attempts (""I've tried to kill myself 8 times""). It expresses frustration with others dismissing their experiences. Emotional indicators include exhaustion (""I'm tired"") and distress about abuse/mental illness.  
   
2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Explicitly states ""me being suicidal"" and ""tried to kill myself,"" confirming personal desire/thoughts. No negation of desire (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No *current* plan/method/preparation described. Focus is on past actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: Key phrase ""I've tried to kill myself 8 times"" describes **past, concrete, self-initiated actions** that were potentially lethal (attempts). This satisfies the 'Attempt' definition.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly disclosed, making 'Attempt' the strongest fit.  
   - Rules state: If past attempts are described, 'Attempt' takes precedence over current ideation/behavior (which isn’t detailed here).  
   - No ambiguity: The phrase ""tried to kill myself"" confirms initiated lethal actions.

103,bruh. they always say if something/someone makes you sad then you're better off without them right? but when i say i'm better off dead everyone's like no don't do that :D,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post mentions ""i'm better off dead,"" which references death in relation to the author.  
   - Emotional tone is frustrated/sarcastic (e.g., "":D"" emoji), contrasting societal advice with reactions to suicidal statements.  
   - No explicit plan, method, preparation, or timeline (e.g., no tools, locations, notes).  
   - No description of past actions or attempts.  
   - Focus is on others' reactions to the author’s statement about being ""better off dead,"" not a direct expression of intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - The phrase ""i'm better off dead"" implies a passive wish to not exist but lacks direct suicidal phrasing (e.g., ""kill myself"").  
   - The tone frames it as a rhetorical comparison to societal advice, not a personal declaration of desire to die.  
   - No explicit negation of suicidal thoughts, but the context suggests venting frustration rather than expressing active intent.  
   → Leans toward **Indicator**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - No mention of plans, methods, tools, or preparations.  
   → **Not Behavior**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts).  
   → **Not Attempt**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The core issue is distress about others' hypocrisy regarding suicidal statements, not a current desire to die.  
   - ""Better off dead"" is vague and lacks personal suicidal intent; it’s used to highlight societal inconsistency.  
   - Ambiguity about genuine desire to die → **Indicator** per rules (when uncertain between Indicator/Ideation, choose Indicator).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of method: ""i took 44 paracetamol"" (specific substance and quantity).  
   - Action timing: ""almost an ho[u]r ago"" (recent past action).  
   - Physical symptoms: ""stomach is hurting very badly,"" ""sweating badly and shaking,"" indicating ongoing effects.  
   - Emotional context: ""i feel like a burden,"" self-blame (""i did this to myself"").  
   - Stated desire: ""i dont think i want to die"" (negates current explicit wish to die).  
   - Help-seeking: Hesitation to call emergency services but asks for advice on survival.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Desire to die is explicitly negated: ""i dont think i want to die.""  
   - Primary focus is distress about physical consequences and ambivalence.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Method is explicitly stated (""44 paracetamol""), but this describes a **completed action**, not a future plan.  
   - No mention of ongoing preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past action** (took pills an hour ago) that was self-initiated and potentially lethal.  
   - Physical symptoms confirm a concrete, life-threatening act was initiated.  
   - Ambivalence (""i dont think i want to die"") does not negate the lethality of the action taken.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is a description of a **past, potentially lethal self-harm action** (overdose), making this an 'Attempt' under the definition.  
   - Stated lack of current desire to die is noted but irrelevant to classifying the *completed action*.  
   - Rules prioritize 'Attempt' when a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal act is described, even if interrupted or followed by regret.

105,"I want to end it. I want to end it but I have no idea how, when or anything else",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The key elements include the phrase ""I want to end it,"" which is a common euphemism for suicide, indicating a personal desire to die. The repetition emphasizes strong intent.
   - Emotional indicators: Despair and hopelessness are implied by the desire to ""end it.""
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Indirect but clear through ""end it,"" suggesting suicidal intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: Explicitly negated with ""I have no idea how, when or anything else,"" indicating no plan, method, or preparation is present.
   - References to past actions: None; the post focuses on current thoughts.
   - Imminence: No time frame mentioned; uncertainty about ""when"" is highlighted.
   - Stated desire: The writer expresses a genuine wish to die (""I want to end it"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. The lack of knowledge about ""how"" or ""when"" suggests uncertainty but not a rejection of the desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""end it"" is a strong, contextually clear euphemism for suicide.
   - It expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive, as seen in ""I want to end it.""
   - There is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to""). Instead, the desire is affirmed, with the barrier being uncertainty about execution.
   - This leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Indicator' because the personal desire to die is explicit and not negated.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or tool is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present; the post explicitly states ""no idea how, when or anything else.""
   - This absence of any plan or preparation elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and desires, not past events.
   - No description of any initiated action (e.g., no mention of a past attempt or recent action that was stopped or failed).
   - This confirms 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows a personal, explicit desire to die (""I want to end it""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity about suicidal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, as explicitly stated in the text, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' is ruled out.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit: The author expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die but provides no indication of a plan or method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress, exhaustion, hopelessness (""feels completely hopeless""), feeling misunderstood (""no one realises how bad I am""), and anhedonia (""I don't know why I can't just enjoy my life"").  
   - Mentions of being a burden (""relying on me for stability when I'm not stable myself"") and isolation (""I just want someone to care"") are present.  
   - **No references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions** related to suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions bipolar diagnosis, therapy, past struggles (depression, mental breakdowns, almost being abusive, puking daily), and feeling lonely/lost.  
   - Key phrases: ""almost being abusive,"" ""rock bottom was [...] puking everyday for nearly 2 years,"" and the metaphorical ""there's nothing lower but death.""  
   - No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or death as a personal desire. Death is referenced abstractly (""nothing lower but death"") to contrast with rock bottom.  
   - Emotional tone: Hopeful (therapy, self-acceptance, ""been way better""), self-reflective, and encouraging others.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The phrase ""nothing lower but death"" is a general observation, not a personal wish to die. No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of wanting to be gone.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""plan on ending it soon"" directly indicates suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional indicators: Overwhelming guilt, fear of others' reactions, and fear of pain.  
   - Specific method/plan: ""overdosing on ibuprofen"" is explicitly stated as the ""go-to plan.""  
   - Preparations: The phrase ""go-to plan"" implies consideration and selection of a method.  
   - Imminence: Timing is uncertain (""tonight or this week, or even anytime soon"").  
   - Desire: Expresses a wish to die (""plan on ending it soon"") but no explicit rejection of suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""ending it soon"" is a direct suicide reference.  
   - **Yes**: ""plan on ending it soon"" confirms a desire to die.  
   - **No**: The writer does not state they *do not want* these thoughts; distress stems from guilt/fear, not rejection of suicidal intent.

   - Describes **future intention** (""plan on ending it soon"") with no past/current actions initiated.  
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""ending it soon"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present *and* a specific method/plan is detailed (ibuprofen overdose), so it exceeds 'Ideation'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No past/recent initiated action (e.g., no ""I took pills"")—only future planning.

   - Specific plan/preparation: ""I plan on doing it next week"" (temporal context) and confidence in the plan.  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts; focuses on future intent.  
   - Strong personal desire to die with no expression of reluctance or unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""suicide plan,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""excited to finally move on"" (indicating active desire).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit mention of a ""suicide plan"" deemed effective, with a timeline (""next week""). Though no method is specified, the acknowledgment of a concrete plan qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""next week"") with no past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions a ""long history of depression and suicidal thoughts,"" a past suicide attempt (""many years ago""), and current recurrence of suicidal thoughts (""I've begun having those thoughts again""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., feeling ""terrible,"" ""like a piece of crap,"" distress over chronic pain and inability to perform daily activities). The user expresses guilt about seeking help and interpersonal conflicts but is actively taking steps to get support (e.g., setting up appointments with wife's help, planning to talk to a friend). No mention of current suicidal plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions (e.g., no specific tools, locations, or timelines like ""tonight""). The focus is on distress about recurring thoughts and seeking help, not on acting on them.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and a past ""attempted suicide.""
   - However, for current intent: The user describes recurring thoughts but does not express a clear, current desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die now""). Instead, the context shows distress about these thoughts and active steps to seek help (e.g., ""I am going to try"" to follow through with appointments). The suicidal thoughts are implied as unwanted due to the help-seeking behavior, but this is not explicitly stated (e.g., no ""I don't want these thoughts""). Thus, the current expression leans more toward distress about thoughts than a genuine wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The references to suicide are about past events (the attempt) or general thoughts, with no indication of current planning (e.g., no tools, locations, or actions like writing a note). The user's actions are focused on getting help, not on self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""many years ago"") that was a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. It also mentions current suicidal thoughts but no current or recent actions. The recurrence of thoughts is framed in the context of distress and help-seeking, with no initiation of new self-harm. Per the rules, if a past attempt is clearly described alongside current ideation, 'Attempt' takes precedence if the past action was concrete.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of past suicide attempt (a concrete action) triggers the 'Attempt' category, as per the rule: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described."" Here, the attempt is clearly stated, and current ideation is present (""begun having those thoughts again""). Although the user is distressed and seeking help—which might suggest 'Indicator' for unwanted thoughts—the precedence rule for 'Attempt' applies. There is no current plan or preparation for 'Behavior', and the past action overrides the current ideation for classification.

In which case I think I would go insane. I have so many issues that I don't tell anyone and I've never felt like that's been an option for me.

It's getting to be too much.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: feeling disconnected (""don't feel like a person""), hopelessness (pushing people away, fear of abandonment), suffering in silence, and depression.  
   - Explicitly references ""thoughts of sh"" (self-harm) but frames it as a suppressed coping mechanism (""I can't even cut because my bf will see"").  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, or methods/plans for suicide. Self-harm (sh) is distinct from suicidal intent here.  
   - Stated desire: Focuses on distress and coping struggles, **not** a wish to die. The writer expresses frustration about being unable to use self-harm to cope, not a desire to end life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.  
   - ""Thoughts of sh"" are explicitly mentioned but contextualized as an *unavailable coping strategy*, not a current suicidal urge. The writer laments the inability to use sh, not an active wish to act on it.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit or implied desire to die. Suicidal intent is absent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No mention** of suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes).  
   - Self-harm (cutting) is referenced as a past/desired coping mechanism but is explicitly avoided (""can't even cut""). This relates to distress management, **not** suicide planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggles and suppressed coping mechanisms.  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted attempts). The focus is on internal suffering, not enacted behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is **distress** (isolation, fear of abandonment, depression) and frustration over being unable to cope via self-harm.  
   - Self-harm thoughts are framed as *unwanted* due to consequences (bf discovering them), not as a current intent.  
   - **No evidence of suicidal desire, plan, or attempt**. Meets ""Indicator"" criteria: distress and abstract/unwanted thoughts without personal suicidal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions death (""when I die"") and explicitly links death to ending pain (""my pain is finally over"").  
   - It expresses hopelessness (""The only way that I can be happy is if I'm dead"") and frames death as a relief.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""when I die"") without imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The author explicitly states a desire to die as the solution to their suffering.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - While ""suicide"" isn’t mentioned, phrases like ""when I die"" and ""the only way I can be happy is if I’m dead"" express a clear, personal desire to die.  
   - There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are referenced.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses a future desire (""when I die"") but describes no past or recent concrete actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (ruling out *Indicator*).  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned (ruling out *Behavior*).  
   - No description of a past or recent initiated action (ruling out *Attempt*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""don't want to live,"" ""goodbye.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is all downhill,"" ""ruined career dreams,"" ""nothing in my life"").  
   - Mentions a decision (""finally decided"") but **no specific method, plan, location, or preparation** (e.g., pills, note-writing, means acquisition).  
   - Temporal context: ""Goodbye"" implies impending action but lacks imminence markers (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""now"") or description of concrete preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""kill myself"" and ""don’t want to live,"" confirming a current, personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/plan**: ""Take the leap"" is metaphorical, not a literal reference to a method (e.g., jumping). No tools, locations, or preparatory actions described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a decision/future intention (""decided to take the leap"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal action** (e.g., no mention of an attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of a past/current lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits **Ideation**: Expresses a clear desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""don’t want to live"") without specificity around means or execution.

Of which, 21 were very enjoyable and loved every second of it while the last 1 year the less said the better. Goodbye and goodluck my fellow damaged beautiful people :)",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes key elements like ""end it all,"" ""call it quits,"" ""finally ending,"" and ""22 years on this earth was enough for me,"" indicating a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include feeling ""relaxed"" about ending life, reflecting on a difficult year (""the last 1 year the less said the better""), and a farewell message (""Goodbye and goodluck""). There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or explicit preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The phrase ""before i end it all"" suggests imminence, but it is not tied to a concrete plan. The author expresses a genuine wish to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""end it all"" and ""call it quits"" to express a clear personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, the author feels resolved (""feel so relaxed"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The act of playing a game ""one last time"" and the farewell could imply preparatory behavior, but it is not explicit or detailed enough to qualify as a plan under the Behavior category. Since there is uncertainty, this leans toward Ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""before i end it all"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts that were stopped or failed). The focus is on imminent ideation, not concrete actions taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die (suicidal intent), placing this beyond Indicator (which requires no personal desire or explicit suicidal thoughts). However, the lack of a specific plan, method, or explicit preparation means it does not meet the threshold for Behavior. No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out Attempt. Therefore, the best fit is Ideation, as it involves explicit personal suicidal thoughts without a stated plan or method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes the author's concern about a friend who mentioned a past suicide attempt (""tried to kill herself"") and is now unresponsive.  
   - Key elements:  
     - Mentions another person's suicide attempt (past action).  
     - Author expresses fear and helplessness (""I'm scared,"" ""pls tell me how do I know if she is ok"").  
   - **No** personal expressions of death, suicide, self-harm, or emotional despair from the author.  
   - Focus is entirely on the friend's situation and the author's anxiety about her safety.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author **does not** express any personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or wishes to not be alive.  
   - Phrases like ""I need help"" refer to seeking support for the friend, not personal distress.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit suicidal intent from the author.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of personal plans, methods, preparations, or suicidal behaviors by the author.  
   - All references to suicide/attempts are about the friend.

   - Describes a **friend's past attempt** (""tried to kill herself three days ago"").  
   - **No** description of any past or recent self-initiated actions by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author shows distress but **only about another person's situation**, not their own mental state.  
   - Lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I will hang myself now,"" ""kill me with it,"" and detailed method (hanging using a tie).  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nobody has ever liked me""), isolation (""alone since I was 5""), and fear (""scared to go out"").  
   - Specific plan/method: Actively seeking tools (""looking for something to tie"") and validating lethality (""I am only 44kg"").  
   - Preparations: Actively acquiring means (""looking for something"") and affirming intent (""now"").  
   - No past actions described; focus is on imminent future action.  
   - Clear desire to die: No negation of intent (e.g., no ""I don’t want to do this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""I will hang myself now,"" ""kill me with it.""  
   - Desire is explicit and current; no rejection of thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (hanging), tools (""something to tie""), and active preparation (""looking for"").  
   - Weight (44kg) reinforces method viability.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Future intention (""will hang myself now"") with immediate preparation.  
   - No past/initiated lethal action described (self-harm mentioned but framed as ineffective, not suicidal).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method + active preparation → **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of being ""shattered,"" ""miserable,"" inability to function, and hopelessness about living (""I don't even know how to just live anymore""). 
   - Crucially, the author explicitly states, ""It's not even that I just want to die,"" which directly negates any personal desire for death or suicide. 
   - There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. 
   - The focus is solely on the author's emotional suffering and functional impairment, with no temporal indicators of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar direct phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die is expressed; instead, the author actively disclaims wanting to die. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and the author emphasizes distress without suicidal desire, this aligns with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are referenced. 
   - The absence of these elements, combined with the lack of suicidal intent, rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional states only, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted events). 
   - This rules out 'Attempt', as no concrete, self-initiated lethal actions are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and misery without any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or actions. The explicit statement denying a wish to die reinforces this. 
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' (which requires a desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires a past/recent lethal action).

   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""**I just want to kill myself**"" and ""**I want out now**.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't see the need,"" ""Tf is this life?"") and desperation (""I want out"").  
   - **No mention** of specific suicide methods, plans (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past/current suicidal actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post opens with ""I WANT TO DOIE"" (likely a typo for ""DIE""), indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""you have no skills valuable""), worthlessness (""everyone hates themselves""), and references to suicidal thoughts as a ""cope"" or distraction.  
   - Specific methods are mentioned (e.g., ""extension ladders,"" ""isolated wire cutters,"" ""make nitroglycerin,"" attacking ""power plants""), but these are framed as hypothetical advice to a generalized ""you,"" not the author’s personal plan.  
   - No indication of past/current preparations or actions by the author. The phrase ""you will never do it"" suggests the author views suicidal action as unlikely.  
   - Temporal context: The author’s desire (""I WANT TO DOIE"") is immediate, but methods/preparations are directed at an abstract ""you,"" not the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states ""I WANT TO DOIE,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - However, suicidal thoughts are later framed as a ""distraction"" and ""fantasy,"" with assertions that the reader (""you"") lacks courage to act. This ambiguity leans toward unwanted thoughts but does not negate the author’s initial explicit desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Methods are described (e.g., explosives, sabotage), but **they are not tied to the author’s personal intent**. They are presented as hypothetical advice (""*you* can produce mayhem,"" ""*Take* a vacation""). No evidence the author is acquiring means or preparing.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions by the author. The focus is on abstract ideation and generalized advice.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author’s explicit desire to die (""I WANT TO DOIE"") suggests **Ideation**.  
   - However, methods/preparations are **not personalized** to the author; they are directed at a hypothetical ""you."" The text frames suicidal thoughts as a ""distraction"" and emphasizes inaction (""you will never do it""), blurring genuine intent.  
   - Given the ambiguity in genuine desire and lack of personal plan/preparation, the safer classification is **Indicator** (distress about suicidal thoughts without clear current intent to act).

   - Emotional indicators: The friend is described as ""mentally disturbed,"" ""constantly tired,"" overwhelmed, refusing to eat/go out, and feeling unable to stand up for herself.  
   - **No mention of suicide/self-harm by the author or the friend**. The only reference to suicide is the bully's statement.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm/suicide by the author or friend.  
   - The author's focus is on seeking justice for their friend, not expressing personal distress about suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit desire to die from the author or their friend. The friend's distress is reactive to bullying (withdrawal, fatigue), but there is no statement indicating suicidal thoughts or a wish to die from either person. The bully's statement (""go kill yourself"") is an external threat, not an expression of the friend's intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** indication of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide by the author or the friend.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **No** description of past or recent suicidal actions by the author or friend.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress about bullying and its impact on the friend (emotional exhaustion, social withdrawal), but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or actions** from the author or the friend. The bully's statement does not reflect the friend's intent. This fits **'Indicator'**: general distress without explicit suicidal ideation or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind everyday,"" ""I want to hang myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I have nothing to look forward to""), self-loathing (""loser, ugly""), isolation, mental illness.  
   - Specific method: ""hang myself.""  
   - Preparations: None mentioned (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes).  
   - Past actions: ""Tried to reach out"" (help-seeking, not suicidal action).  
   - Temporal context: Current/future intention (""I want to hang myself,"" ""how much longer I could last""), with a qualifier (""holding on a bit"" due to hope).  
   - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""I want to hang myself so bad"") but conflicted by residual hope.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes (""kill myself,"" ""suicide is on my mind,"" ""I want to hang myself"").  
   - Desire is present but partially countered by hope; no explicit statement of *unwanted* thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific method mentioned: ""hang myself.""  
   - No preparations described (e.g., ""I have a rope"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts/desire and a method.  
   - No past or recent *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (""hang myself"") = **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Indicator"": Clear personal desire for suicide.  
   - Not ""Ideation"": Method specified.  
   - Not ""Attempt"": No initiated action described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions a recent suicide attempt (""last night I attempted once again"") and references past attempts (""my 15th time"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""still alive unfortunately"") and current suicidal desire (""still want to attempt again""), though this is partially countered by finding ""one thing to live for.""  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparations for a *future* attempt are mentioned. Barriers to seeking help (insurance, COVID risk) are discussed, but these are not suicide plans.  
   - The core focus is on a **past/recent action** (attempt last night) and history of attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Attempted"" directly references suicidal action. ""Still want to attempt again"" confirms ongoing desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific future plan/method**: Current desire to attempt is stated, but no details about means, location, or preparations for a *new* attempt are provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past/recent initiated action**: The post describes a concrete, potentially lethal action (""attempted last night"") that was self-initiated. This qualifies as an *attempt* under the definition, regardless of outcome or current intent.  
   - Mentions of past attempts (""15th time"") reinforce the focus on historical behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The **description of a recent, self-initiated suicidal action** (""attempted last night"") is the dominant and most severe element.  
   - Current ideation (""still want to attempt again"") is present but secondary to the disclosed past action.  
   - No plan/preparation for a *future* attempt is evident, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
   - **Rules precedence**: Past/recent concrete suicidal actions take priority (→ 'Attempt').

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions distress (""end of my rope,"" ""everything's crumbling,"" ""chest hurting,"" ""scared,"" ""sad"") and hopelessness (""I don't see a reason"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""Deep, deep down, I hope I don't wake up.""  
   - References past actions (""I've done this before"") but lacks specifics about methods or preparations.  
   - Expresses unwanted isolation (""I can't reach out"") but no active plan, method, or imminent timeline for suicide.  
   - Emotional conflict: Wants help but fears burdening friends; expects to survive (""I know I'll wake up"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I hope I don't wake up"" is a clear personal wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Mentions physical sensations (""breath slowing,"" ""falling asleep"") but no tools, locations, or suicide plans. ""Done this before"" implies past struggles, not a concrete method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and passive hopelessness. ""I hope I don't wake up"" implies a *wish* for death during sleep but **no described action** (e.g., taking pills). Past events are referenced vaguely, not as a specific lethal attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I hope I don't wake up"") is present, but no plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. Physical symptoms (e.g., ""falling asleep"") lack suicidal intent context. Past references are nonspecific. Conflict about burdening others and expectation of surviving further indicate thoughts without imminent action.  
   - *Not Indicator*: Explicit death wish exceeds abstract distress.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No method, plan, or concrete action described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""intent to kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" ""loaded gun by my side,"" ""I could die,"" and ""attempt could fail.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""everything is gone,"" ""too late to turn back""), self-perceived burden (""you should've never given me your time""), and finality (""no more chances,"" ""Goodbye"").
   - Specific method/preparations: ""loaded gun"" (method), preparations like emptying the room, deleting accounts, and depleting savings.
   - Imminence: ""once I post this"" and ""I am going to shoot myself"" imply immediate intent.
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""The risk is worth the reward,"" ""I am going to shoot myself"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""kill myself,"" ""I am going to shoot myself,"" and ""I could die"" in a context of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes. Specific method: ""shoot myself"" with a ""loaded gun."" Preparations: Room emptied, savings gone, accounts deleted.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes past ideation (""since June"") but no past *action* beyond preparations. Current state: Gun is present, and suicide is imminent (""once I post this""), but no initiated action (e.g., holding the gun to their head) is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (gun) + preparations (room/savings) = **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Attempt"" because no concrete, initiated action (e.g., ""I pulled the trigger"") is described—only imminent intent.  
   - Not ""Ideation"" due to explicit plan/method.  
   - Not ""Indicator"" due to clear suicidal desire and plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past action: ""tried to pass a week ago,"" ""swallowed [bleach],"" ""vomited,"" ""had heartburn.""  
   - Describes specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparation (leaving a suicide note).  
   - Explicitly states a suicidal act was initiated (""grabbed the bleach and swallowed it"").  
   - Notes the outcome (survived due to vomiting) and aftermath (heartburn, mother informed).  
   - Current state: ""a little okay now,"" but acknowledges lingering distress (""still in there"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Tried to pass"" implies intent to die, and actions (note, swallowing bleach) confirm suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (swallowing bleach) and preparation (suicide note) are explicitly mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (swallowing bleach).  
   - The act was interrupted (vomited), but the concrete action was taken.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post details a **concrete past suicidal act** (ingesting poison).  
   - This fits the 'Attempt' definition: a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action, even if it failed.  
   - Current improvements (""doing better now"") don’t override the past attempt description.  
   - Rules: Past attempts take precedence over current ideation/behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions ""lost all will to live,"" ""I still want to die,"" and ""the only thing stopping me"" (emotional burden). 
   - Explicit personal desire to die (""I still want to die"") is present.  
   - No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - No past actions initiated (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" describing a concrete act).  
   - Temporal context: Current/future desire (""I still want to die"") with a restraint (parents' grief), but no timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I still want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of suicidal desire. The writer does not frame these thoughts as unwanted (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, plan, or preparation** mentioned (e.g., no pills, notes, locations). Restraint is emotional (fear of hurting parents), not logistical.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **current desire** (""I still want to die"").  
   - **No past/initiated lethal actions** (e.g., ""tried to pull through"" refers to coping efforts, not a suicide attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""want to die"") with **no plan/method/preparation**. The absence of actionable details (methods, timeline, preparations) rules out 'Behavior'. Emotional restraint (parents) doesn’t negate the desire.  
   - **Not Indicator**: The desire is explicit and personal, not abstract/unwanted.  
   - **Not Attempt/Behavior**: No past/initiated actions or planning elements.

I'm fine with either outcome.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""thinking of suicide for months on end,"" indicating persistent suicidal thoughts.
   - It references a hypothetical future action (""take a few tabs of acid"") with ambiguous intent—framed as a potential coping mechanism rather than a direct suicide method.
   - Emotional indicators include despair (""deepest depths,"" ""darkest corners"") and resignation (""I'm fine with either outcome"").
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., pills, hanging), or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring tools) is described. The acid is presented as an exploratory step, not a means to die.
   - No past/initiated suicidal actions are mentioned (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills last week"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""thinking of suicide for months on end"" directly expresses personal suicidal ideation. The phrase ""my end will only get nearer"" further implies a desire for death if the acid fails, without negating the desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to die"" statement).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No**: Taking acid is framed as a trial for relief (""see what happens first""), not a suicide method. No other tools, locations, or preparations are cited. The phrase ""my end will only get nearer"" suggests a future possibility but lacks concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes ongoing ideation (""months on end"") and a future experiment (taking acid), but **no initiated or past suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I attempted"" or ""I prepared"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation** fits best: Explicit desire to die (""thinking of suicide,"" ""my end"") is present, but no specific plan/method/preparation is indicated. The acid use is exploratory, not behavioral preparation for suicide. Absence of past/current suicidal actions rules out ""Attempt."" The expressed desire for death distinguishes this from ""Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions stealing and consuming dog's prescription hydrocodone (an opioid) and drinking alcohol to cope.  
   - Expresses emotional distress (""i hit a new low,"" ""i havent felt ok in a while,"" ""im not sure what to do"").  
   - **No explicit references to suicide, death, self-harm, or desire to die**. Substance misuse is framed as a coping mechanism (""to feel ok for one night"").  
   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or timelines** related to suicide.  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.  
   - Substance misuse is tied to seeking relief, not ending life.  
   - **Conclusion**: No suicidal intent (leaning toward 'Indicator').  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Hydrocodone/alcohol use is **not presented as a suicide method** (e.g., no ""I took these to overdose/die"").  
   - **No evidence** of planning/preparation for suicide.  
   - **Conclusion**: Does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **recent substance misuse as coping**, not as a suicidal act.  
   - **No mention of past/current suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose"").  
   - **Conclusion**: Not an 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Primary content: **Distress + non-suicidal substance misuse**.  
   - Lacks **personal desire to die**, **suicidal plans**, or **concrete actions**.  
   - Fits '**Indicator**' (expressing distress without suicidal intent).

131,31/m - I see no point in living anymore. I don't have any friends. Nothing in my life is working out,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses hopelessness (""I see no point in living anymore""), social isolation (""I don't have any friends""), and general life dissatisfaction (""Nothing in my life is working out""). There are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include despair and anhedonia, but no plans, preparations, or references to past actions are present. The statement is general and lacks imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The writer's desire focuses on distress about life circumstances rather than an explicit wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It expresses hopelessness but not a clear desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I want to be dead""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no indication they are unwanted or resisted. Due to the absence of explicit suicidal intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The content is solely about emotional distress, with no planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes current feelings of hopelessness with no reference to past, current, or future suicidal actions. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: The post indicates severe distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal expression of desire to die, specific suicidal thoughts, or any plan/method. It aligns with 'Indicator' as it discusses life dissatisfaction abstractly without explicit suicidal intent. If there were ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen per the rules. No elements support 'Ideation' (which requires explicit desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan/method), or 'Attempt' (which requires described actions).

So here you, Macy, taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow. You weren't supposed to know all this and I'm sorry you do now.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""taken a fuck load of pills and might not wake up tomorrow,"" which directly references a specific method of self-harm (overdosing on pills) and implies a lethal outcome. Emotional indicators include guilt (""I feel so guilty""), feelings of being a burden (""my problems are my own not theirs,"" ""They deserve so much more than me""), and despair. The phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" indicates that a concrete action has already been initiated, not just planned. The temporal context is immediate (""might not wake up tomorrow""), suggesting the action occurred recently. The author expresses a desire for death through this act, as there is no indication the thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it explicitly conveys a desire to die through the action described (""might not wake up tomorrow""). There is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them; instead, the action is presented as completed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method is mentioned (""pills""), and the phrase ""taken a fuck load of pills"" indicates that the method has been acted upon. This goes beyond mere planning or preparation—it describes an initiated action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past/recent action (""taken"" is past tense) that is potentially lethal (overdosing on pills). This is a self-initiated, concrete suicidal act, even if the outcome is uncertain (""might not wake up tomorrow""). The action is not hypothetical or planned; it has been carried out, aligning with the definition of an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit suicidal intent and a specific method, but crucially, it describes an action that has already been initiated. This fits the 'Attempt' category, which covers past or recent potentially lethal actions. The mention of guilt and burden supports the context but does not override the described attempt. 'Behavior' would apply if there was only planning without action, but here the action has occurred. 'Ideation' or 'Indicator' are less appropriate due to the initiated lethal action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning out my suicide"" and states a clear desire to die (""I can't find a reason... to continue living"").  
   - Emotional indicators include exhaustion (""tired of the constant struggle""), fear of failed attempts, and intent to avoid burdening others.  
   - A specific timeline is provided (""beginning of the new year, come January 1st""), indicating imminence.  
   - References to past attempts (""fear of failing an attempt once again"") and explicit planning (""planning out my suicide"") are present.  
   - The author’s desire to die is unambiguous and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""planning out my suicide,"" ""I intend to do it right,"" and ""I will go through with this"" confirm active personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Plan**: A timeline is specified (""January 1st"").  
   - **Preparation**: Mentions avoiding detection (""not tell anyone,"" ""silently reminisce"") and learning from past failures to ensure success.  
   - Though no *specific method* (e.g., pills, gun) is named, explicit planning and temporal details qualify as ""preparations"" under the **Behavior** definition.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""I intend to do it right this time,"" ""January 1st"").  
   - Past attempts are referenced but described as historical context; no *recent/ongoing* lethal action is initiated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Desire to die is explicit and personal.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific plan (timeline + concealment strategy) and preparations (learning from past) exceed mere desire.  
   - **Not Attempt**: Describes future intent, not a past/recent *initiated* lethal action (past attempts are noted but not the focus).  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + explicit planning/preparation (date, strategy to avoid intervention) aligns with the definition.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a strong desire not to live (""I actually 100% do not want to live anymore,"" ""I actually hate being alive""). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, despair, and feeling like a burden (""i dont want to weigh down my family and friends"").

   - Imminence is considered (""do it now""), but it is framed as a hypothetical thought (""i wonder"") rather than a stated intention, and the post concludes with inaction (""For now i guess i will just sit here"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die but is conflicted due to fear (""i am to scared to kill myself"") and concern for others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and directly expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""do not want to live anymore,"" ""hate being alive"").
   - The suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted; instead, the writer is considering acting on them but is held back by fear and guilt. This indicates a current personal desire to die, not just distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The phrase ""kill myself"" is vague and lacks detail about how it would be carried out.
   - Without any indication of a plan or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current thoughts and feelings, with no description of past or recent initiated actions. The contemplation (""i wonder if i should just do it now"") is forward-looking but not an account of an action that was started or completed.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content includes explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire and thoughts, satisfying the criteria for 'Ideation'.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - The presence of a clear desire to die distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which would apply if suicidal thoughts were unwanted or if there was only general distress without personal intent.
   - No past or recent actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post shows a desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no specific plan or preparatory behavior.

135,"i half heartedly attempt suicide frequently. i hang myself but always leave a chair or elevated object to stand onto after a minute or so, so i don't die. Does anyone else do this?",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""attempt suicide"" and describes a specific method: hanging.  
   - Emotional indicators: Describes ""half heartedly"" attempting, implying ambivalence, and explicitly states the goal is *not* to die (""so i don't die"").  
   - Specific method/preparation: Details hanging with a safeguard (leaving a chair/elevated object).  
   - Temporal context: Describes *frequent past actions* (initiated hanging but aborted).  
   - Desire: Explicitly states actions are taken to avoid death, indicating no genuine intent to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" and personal action (""I hang myself"").  
   - **But** the writer clarifies they actively prevent death (""stand onto after a minute... so I don’t die""), negating genuine desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method (hanging) and preparation (leaving an object to stand on) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **repeated past actions**: ""frequently"" initiates hanging but aborts by standing on the object.  
   - This constitutes *initiated, potentially lethal actions* that were interrupted by the self.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is the description of **past initiated actions** (hanging) with safeguards to avoid death.  
   - Under the **Attempt** definition, these are ""past... self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal, even if interrupted by self... or failed.""  
   - The ambivalence (""half heartedly"") and lack of death desire do *not* override that concrete actions were taken.  
   - **Attempt** takes precedence over Ideation/Behavior because a historical action (even aborted) is described.

I've been suicidal for about 6 years now, i had an attempt when I was 14 and I barely made it out. After that I had a few close calls but never succeed. I came back to my home country and find myself in the same problem. My girlfriend is the only person who helped me through all the pain and my family doesn't like her. At the time they where running a school for people who couldn't afford to pay for their visa. But then after they disapproved of me liking her they stopped and she had to go home. Now we always talk about how much we want each other but we are not quite able to be together. There's a lot more to it but basically it seems like an impossible situation. I can't save money to see her because I can't go home to Australia now. I haven't told my family I still talk to her. This sucks and I see no point anymore, I. Trying to pursue happiness when all I ended up being is a lonely kid in his dark room waiting for something nice to happen to me. I dropped out if school and now I'm watching everyone move in with their lives. They have their girlfriends with them and then say to me how much they miss them. I still hold on to the hope that someday we will really be together even after all this. We have been in a long distance relationship for a year now and had 3 months together before she left. Life's a bitch when you have a christian family that believes be being with her is against gods will. I believe God who created love would approve. But it's not my choice. I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore, it's been a good run but I guess this world's just not meant for me. It sucks because I can't go even if I want to. The pain j feel when I think of her tears breaks me. Im stuck. In alone. I guess all I want to say is. If you have your loved ones with you. The girl or guy you would do anything for.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions past suicide attempt at age 14 (""I had an attempt... barely made it out"") and ""a few close calls.""
   - Expresses current hopelessness (""I see no point anymore,"" ""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore,"" ""this world's just not meant for me"").
   - Describes intense emotional distress (loneliness, feeling trapped, relationship struggles, family conflict).
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timelines).
   - Stated desire to die is present (""I don't really feel like I want to go on anymore"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicitly mentions past suicidal behavior and current desire to not ""go on."" No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No current method, tools, locations, or preparations described. References to past attempts lack details about imminent plans.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Past attempt (""when I was 14"") and ""close calls"" are historical. No recent/ongoing lethal actions described. Current expressions focus on hopelessness and passive desire to die without actionable steps.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Past attempts don't override current state (rules: 'Attempt' requires focus on recent/concrete lethal actions).
   - Explicit desire to die (""don't want to go on"") with distress qualifies for 'Ideation'.
   - Absence of current plan/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. General distress + suicidal thoughts without active planning aligns with 'Ideation' per definitions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses frustration about life circumstances (""I am 29 still live with my parents"") and includes nonsensical keyboard mashing (""4kdjejdne sjdjd fuckkkkkkkkdjejekieirieiriodidieiridodiodididodidookdkekekdkoeooeo"").  
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators are limited to frustration (via ""fuckkkkkk"") but lack hopelessness, despair, or burden themes.  
   - No references to past actions, temporal urgency, or desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.  
   - The gibberish does not convey coherent suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No** mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No** description of past/current suicidal actions or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""killing myself,"" ""hang myself,"" ""start cutting again,"" ""wish I could die in my sleep.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'll finally do it""), resignation (""not afraid of killing myself anymore"").  
   - Specific plan/method: Mentions ""how to properly hang myself"" and ""start cutting again"" to increase COVID risk.  
   - Preparations/logistics: Notes barriers (""too much potential interference"") but expresses determination (""I'll break killing myself regardless"").  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""wish I could die,"" ""I'll finally do it"").  
   - Past actions: Claims ""I've done it many times,"" but context suggests this refers to ideation/planning (not concrete attempts), as suicide cannot be ""done"" multiple times lethally.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases (""killing myself,"" ""hang myself"").  
   - **Yes**: Clear desire to die (""I wish I could die,"" ""I'll finally do it"").  
   - **No**: Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; the author affirms intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods mentioned (hanging, cutting combined with COVID exposure).  
   - **Yes**: Preparation implied through logistical assessment (""potential interference"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Future intention: ""One of these days I'll finally do it.""  
   - Past reference (""done it many times"") is ambiguous but likely refers to ideation/planning (not concrete actions), given the phrasing. No description of a past *initiated lethal act* (e.g., no details of an attempt being interrupted).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific methods/preparations → **Behavior**.  
   - ""Attempt"" is ruled out: No concrete past/recent lethal action described (e.g., ""I tried to hang myself yesterday"" would qualify).  
   - ""Ideation"" is insufficient due to method details (hanging, cutting/COVID).  
   - ""Indicator"" is ruled out by explicit personal desire to die and planning.

Like I'm feeling doomed, as if something worse was coming to me if I kept existing.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""thoughts in the back of my head telling me to end it all,"" indicating suicidal ideation. 
   - Emotional indicators include feeling ""doomed"" and fearing ""something worse"" if they keep existing, suggesting hopelessness. 
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. 
   - The thoughts are described as persistent over a year but passive (""thoughts telling me""), with no reference to past actions or imminent intent (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""). 
   - The phrasing frames the thoughts as intrusive (""telling me"") rather than a stated personal desire to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The phrase ""end it all"" is a direct reference to suicide. 
   - However, the writer does not explicitly state *their own desire* to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, they describe the thoughts as externalized (""thoughts telling me""), implying distress about the thoughts themselves. No negation of desire is explicit, but the framing leans toward unwanted ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is solely on persistent thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The thoughts are ongoing (""over the course of a year""). 
   - No description of past or recent actions (e.g., initiating self-harm). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core issue is distress about intrusive suicidal thoughts without a stated personal desire to act, plan, or method.  
   - This aligns with **Indicator**: The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal ideation but lacks explicit personal desire to die or actionable intent.  
   - *Why not Ideation?* While ""end it all"" suggests suicidal thoughts, the framing (""thoughts telling me"") distances the writer from ownership of the desire, making genuine suicidal intent ambiguous. Per the rules, ambiguity between Indicator and Ideation defaults to Indicator.

Suffering from depression and anxiety for years, doesn't want to work, hate the line of career shown to me by my family, hate the stupid decisions I took throughout my life, never been in a real relationship, have no meaningful friends, no ambitions and goals. I have a peculiar dysfunction in my eyes and I have problems in seeing that my family would never understand. I can't even drive because of that. I am probably having ADHD since childhood. There was a lot of signs then and now. But my family knows pretty well that mental illness is a hoax and depression and these things are just other names for  being lazy and immature.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal actions: ""I tried to drown myself. I tried to hang. I even tried to jump off from the 4th floor.""  
   - Expresses intense hopelessness, self-loathing, and worthlessness (e.g., ""useless piece of garbage,"" ""waste resources"").  
   - Describes specific methods: drowning, hanging, jumping from a height (4th floor).  
   - States these actions were initiated but stopped (""chickened out each time""), confirming concrete attempts.  
   - No explicit current plan/preparation for future suicide; focus is on past failures.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly references personal suicide attempts with phrases like ""tried to drown,"" ""tried to hang,"" ""tried to jump.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (drowning, hanging, jumping) are explicitly stated but **in the context of past actions**, not current plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

   - These are concrete suicide attempts, not just thoughts or plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past potentially lethal actions (interrupted by self) fit the **'Attempt'** definition.

   - Explicitly mentions suicidal thoughts: ""If suicide wasn't damn hard I would have been gone when I was 15,"" ""I feel like I'm becoming more confident to kill myself,"" and ""I might actually get the courage to do it.""  
   - There is a clear **desire to die** (e.g., ""I would have been gone"") and **current suicidal intent** (""becoming more confident to kill myself"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or timelines). The phrase ""get the courage to do it"" implies future intent but lacks concrete details.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past passive wish** (age 15) but **no concrete past/current action** (e.g., no ""I attempted""). Current statements are future-oriented (""might get the courage"") without initiation.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""kill myself"") and suicidal intent place this beyond general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: Suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation is specified. ""Courage to do it"" is vague; no actionable details.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No described past/recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I tried"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" (death intent), ""I have enough Trazodone and will get alcohol today"" (specific method: overdose via Trazodone and alcohol; preparation: acquiring means).
   - Emotional indicators: ""pain is too much,"" despair implied by hiding suicidal feelings.
   - Specific plan/method: Trazodone + alcohol overdose, with timeline (""today,"" ""dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - No past actions described—focus is on future intent.
   - Writer’s desire: Clear wish to die (""be dead""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes: ""be dead in less than 24 hours"" directly expresses a desire to die. No negation or distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes: Specific method (Trazodone + alcohol) and preparations (""have enough Trazodone,"" ""will get alcohol today""). Timeline confirms imminent execution.

   - Future intention: Plan to act ""today"" with outcome (""dead in less than 24 hours"").
   - No past/initiated actions described—only future planning.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep hopelessness (""I want to give up,"" ""My life has no worth""), anhedonia (""Nothing makes sense anymore""), guilt, and feelings of being a burden (""Why the fuck am I alive... I bring nothing to the table"").  
   - No explicit mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Temporal context focuses on chronic distress (""struggling since I was a child"") and current emotional pain, but no references to past/planned actions.  
   - Desires center on escaping pain (""I want to give up"") but lack direct expressions of a wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No** explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.  
   - Despair is evident (""Why am I alive?""), but it frames existence as burdensome rather than stating a desire to die. The phrase ""I want to give up"" suggests surrender to suffering, not a death wish.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions death/suicide: ""let myself pass away,"" ""kill me,"" ""slowly kill myself,"" and ""I'm going to die.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (using anorexia to die), desire to ""cushion the pain"" for others.  
   - Specific method: Starvation via anorexia, with a quantified plan (""goal weight is 78 pounds,"" ""might have to go lower"").  
   - Preparation: Actively pursuing weight loss to achieve a lethal outcome.  
   - Imminence: Ongoing process (""slowly kill myself""), not immediate but intentional.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

145,Bbq tent. Is it possible to suicide from charcoal bbq in a tent?,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicide"" directly and references a specific method (""charcoal bbq in a tent""), which implies carbon monoxide poisoning. There are no emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, despair), no stated plans or preparations (e.g., acquiring means or writing notes), no references to past actions, and no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The post is phrased as a question about the feasibility of a method, not as a personal expression of desire or intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly uses the word ""suicide,"" but it is in the context of a general inquiry (""Is it possible..."") rather than a personal expression of desire (e.g., ""I want to die""). The author does not state a clear, personal wish to die or not be alive, nor do they express distress about unwanted suicidal thoughts. This lack of personal intent leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (charcoal bbq in a tent) is mentioned, but it is part of a hypothetical question, not tied to the author's personal plans or preparations. The author does not indicate they are considering, planning, or preparing for this method themselves. Without a personal expression of intent alongside the method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past, current, or future actions initiated by the author. It is purely a question about possibility, with no reference to concrete actions, attempts, or timelines. Therefore, it does not qualify for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly by inquiring about a method but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, or action. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes general or abstract discussions of suicide without clear, current personal intent. There is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (e.g., the question could stem from curiosity, academic interest, or indirect distress), and per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', 'Indicator' is chosen. The mention of a method does not elevate it to 'Behavior' because there is no accompanying personal expression of suicidal ideation or intent from the author.

Like from the outside, everything should be going fine. I have a good relationship with my family, I have a job, and can pay my bills. So everything that makes me want want to die is my own fault. I have a terrible relationship with my body, I've always been overweight and I am so self conscious about it. I've started to lose weight but I still hate everything about how I look. I see all the parts that stick out and I don't think I'll escape it. But what's worse is that I'm a trans man. I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go. I don't feel like actually committing die, I just think everyone would be better off without dealing with me, either my friends having to hear my complaining or my family having to deal with a trans child. I just feel like an embarrassment for everyone and don't deserve anything, from friends to family to love.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense distress, self-loathing, hopelessness (""everything about me is wrong,"" ""I don't think I'll escape it,"" ""everyone would be better off without dealing with me""), and feelings of being a burden.  
   - **Explicit negation of suicidal action**: The author states, ""I don't feel like actually committing die,"" clarifying they lack current intent to act on suicidal thoughts.  
   - No mention of methods, plans, preparations, or past suicide attempts. References to death are abstract (e.g., ""everything that makes me want to die"") but framed as internal struggles, not actionable intent.  
   - Focus is on emotional pain (dysphoria, isolation, worthlessness) and perceived burdensomeness, not a desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Phrases like ""want to die"" appear but are contextualized as passive feelings (""everything that makes me want to die""), not active desire.  
   - **Crucially, the author explicitly negates intent**: ""I don't feel like actually committing die."" This directly rejects suicidal action, framing the distress as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None present**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or preparations for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or imminent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and passive thoughts about death/being a burden but **explicitly disavows suicidal intent or action**.  
   - The author’s statement (""I don’t feel like actually committing die"") anchors this in **unwanted thoughts/distress**, not a desire to die.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Abstract distress, hopelessness, and explicit rejection of suicidal behavior. Ambiguity about active desire to die resolves to 'Indicator' per rules.

147,My heart hurts and I want to die. My long term bf and I got into a bad fight. All because I thought I asked a harmless question and it spiraled. Usually when we fight we always end positively but this time it felt different. It ended badly. It was more let's just forget this happened. We've been together for so long and we always talked about building a life together and now I feel like I don't know if that's possible. Our relationship feels damaged this time. I loved him so much and felt so lucky to be with him. I don't really know what to do. I'm just passively letting whatever happen happen. I don't care. I didn't mean to hurt his feelings and I feel like the worst person. I feel like I don't want to live. I gave everything I have in this relationship and I was genuinely happy for being with him. I always accidentally hurt him. For asking things that I didn't think would hurt him or offend him. Then he said some things that hurt. Everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down. It hurts so much and I just feel like dying. I just wish I had someone to talk to,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress (""My heart hurts,"" ""It hurts so much""), hopelessness (""I don't know if that's possible,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live""), and despair (""everything was perfect and it all came crumbling down""). 
   - Explicit personal statements about suicidal desire appear: ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" 
   - No mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), plans (e.g., ""I will do it tonight""), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past suicidal actions. 
   - The focus is on overwhelming emotional pain from a relationship conflict, with passive resignation (""passively letting whatever happen happen"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""I want to die,"" ""I feel like I don't want to live,"" and ""I just feel like dying."" These are clear, current expressions of a desire to die by the author. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I won't do it"") or framing of thoughts as unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No** specific method, tools, location, timeline, or preparations are mentioned. The suicidal expressions are generalized and lack concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - All statements reflect current emotional suffering and desire. There is **no description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and lack of negation place this beyond **Indicator**. 
   - Absence of methods/plans/preparations rules out **Behavior**. 
   - No description of past/recent initiated suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**. 
   - The post fits **Ideation**: explicit personal desire to die without plans, methods, or actions.

148,"3 weeks TW(animal abuse-sexual assault-murder). I'm giving it 3 weeks to turn around. it doesn't help having this bullshit thing women have every month. But I can't do it anymore. Im tired of them yelling, and fighting. Im tired of hearing the dogs cry in pain from getting kicked or hit. I don't like being in a false sense of security. Nothing's real to me anymore. It never has been actually. I can't find a way to release. I can't find away to fix them. Fix myself. anything. Why do I keep having thoughts of hurting everyone? Why do I want to feel the thrill of stabbing someone? Why do I want horrible things to happen to me, just to feel better? Sexual assault isn't anyone's dream, so why do I want it to happen to me? I feel like it may have happened to me before, and maybe I don't remember. I don't want it for the attention. I want it to happen just to feel valid. My trauma isn't bad enough to be here. If it was, I'd probably have DID or Bipolar disorder. Something bad like those. Having a horrible disease isn't any dream either. Yet I want it. Something like POTS or EDS. Something bad like those I guess. Fuck, is it the attention I want? Did any of it really happen? If it did happen, why don't I remember any of it? Why can't I remember anything at all? Where has everything gone. What has happened to get us here? Why do I have to be like this? I don't want anything from anyone, yet I have to have it. Every time I see something about this illness, or that disability, my brain forces me to think I have it. I know I don't have any of it, but I can't help to think I might. No wonder why I'm in a place like this. In a head like mine. I'm an abomination. What is wrong with me. It's even more fucked, seeing as I treat myself like a sick dog. Trying to wait it out, looking for any signs of hope. Feeling ok here n there. Getting sick again. waiting. Eventually it'll get sick enough to the point it has to be put down. It sounds weird hearing the ""dog"" put itself down. Why is it much sadder when its an animal compared to a human? Weird what we choose to value more over the other.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being overwhelmed (""I can't do it anymore,"" ""Nothing's real to me,"" ""I'm an abomination"").  
   - There are **no explicit mentions of suicide, death, dying, or self-harm**. The closest reference is the metaphorical comparison of the author to a ""sick dog"" that ""has to be put down,"" but this is framed as an abstract outcome rather than a personal plan.  
   - Key themes include unwanted violent thoughts toward others (""thoughts of hurting everyone""), a desire for trauma/illness to feel ""valid,"" dissociation (""I don't remember any of it""), and self-loathing.  
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines** for self-harm or suicide are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die"" appear.  
   - The ""put down"" metaphor implies a passive wish for relief from suffering but **lacks a clear, personal desire to actively end life**. The framing (""waiting it out,"" ""has to be put down"") suggests resignation, not intent.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not explicitly stated**, and the focus is on distress about intrusive thoughts (e.g., wanting harm/illness) rather than a wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific methods** (e.g., pills, jumping) or **preparations** (e.g., note, acquiring means) are described.  
   - The ""put down"" metaphor references euthanasia but is **not literal or actionable**; it’s an analogy for hopelessness.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes ongoing emotional pain and intrusive thoughts but **no past or recent suicidal actions**.  
   - The ""3 weeks"" timeline refers to waiting for life to improve, not a suicide plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core issue is **distress about unwanted thoughts** (violence, trauma, illness) and hopelessness, with **no explicit desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - The metaphor is concerning but **lacks personal suicidal intent**, falling under abstract discussion of suffering.  
   - Without explicit suicidal desire, plan, or action, the post aligns with **Indicator**, which captures severe distress without clear suicidal intent.

149,"why does the thought of suicide feel like an obligation at times. I have been ""plotting"" my suicide seriously on and off for months. Every time I come out of my slump and horrid hole of thoughts, I feel an enormous sense of relief. Yesterday, I drafted my will and strangely that calmed me down. I wasn't scared. Today, I feel better. I just wonder if anyone else feels like when they back off the proverbial cliff, do they feel almost shame, or guilt? Like that suicide pact with yourself is an obligation? I think it is because the torment of thoughts and reason behind them are still there, but manageable. I just wanted to ask you collectively, as a community. I can't ask my husband or mother without terrifying them, as I know it would. I don't want to scare them. Anyway, I hate the lingering emotional aftermath. And the feeling like I am not following through. That sentence sounds haunting; please don't worry. As ironic as that sounds, I am out of my hole for now. I am in counseling. The biggest secret is no one knows I have thought of this, or for how long. I would never involve someone else in my demise, I wouldn't have anyone find me that wasn't trained to do so. I would never use a weapon from my household. I.I don't think I would do ""it"". I am just tired. I am so fucking delicate and I cannot stand being weak. I know everyone in this world goes through shit- my problems lie in my brain. I feel different than anyone else. Not able to connect- not in a sociopathic way (no offense to sociopaths),  but like I was wired different and a shortage happened in the middle that made me odd or different to anyone. I know there are many people who want to be alive and are sick, or who died and shouldn't have. I don't want to be selfish. Or take this grand journey for granted. I just can't ""click"" into life.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""plotting"" suicide seriously on and off for months, drafting a will, and specific methods (avoiding household weapons, ensuring only trained personnel find them).  
   - Emotional indicators: shame, guilt, feeling ""obligated"" to suicide, exhaustion, self-perceived weakness, and disconnection.  
   - Preparations: Drafting a will (calming effect) and detailed planning (""plotting"").  
   - No imminent timeline (e.g., ""today"" or ""tonight""); instead, focuses on cyclical thoughts and relief during non-slump periods.  
   - Stated desire: Explicitly says, ""I don't think I would do 'it'"" and emphasizes relief when out of the ""hole.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - **Yes**: Expresses a desire tied to despair (""obligation,"" ""torment of thoughts"").  
   - **But**: Clarifies suicidal thoughts as unwanted (""I don't think I would do 'it'"") and linked to episodic distress.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific preparations (drafting a will) and method considerations (excluding household weapons, ensuring trained personnel handle discovery).  
   - **Yes**: ""Plotting"" implies active planning over months.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing planning (""months"") and a recent preparation (drafting a will ""yesterday"").  
   - **No initiated action**: No mention of past/current lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""). Only planning/preparatory steps.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire + planning/preparation**: ""Plotting"" suicide and drafting a will confirm **Behavior** (specific preparations/method considerations).  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of initiated, potentially lethal actions.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Goes beyond passive desire (e.g., ""I want to die"") due to active planning.

    - Expressions of hopelessness (""i have no one"") and frustration (""i want it to stop"").
    - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The phrase ""he would be better off without me"" suggests feelings of being a burden but does not directly indicate suicidal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger, betrayal, exhaustion, and hopelessness directed at another person (likely an abuser). Key elements include:
   - Strong emotional indicators: ""i'm so tired,"" ""i have no more energy,"" ""the world is just fucked,"" ""EVERYTHING IS FUCKED,"" despair about existence (""why bring someone into this world?"").
   - Mentions of past harm (""do those sorts of things to a child"") and abandonment.
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, or methods**. The closest phrase (""you should've laid in bed... give us peace"") is a wish for *another person's* death, not the author's own.
   - Focus is on externalizing rage and describing emotional depletion, not self-directed violence.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit mentions** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.
   - **No expression of personal desire to die**. Distress is centered on anger toward others and exhaustion from past trauma. The phrase ""it's finally over"" refers to a past event (likely abuse), not suicidal intent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and anger but **lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, method, or action**.
   - Falls under **Indicator**: General distress and despair without suicidal intent. The core themes are exhaustion from abuse and nihilism about the world, not self-directed harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:

Or atleast do my hw I can't get myself to do anything anymore . I'm just in a rut with a very small support system. I want to kill myself I just am too weak and pathetic to do it.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating explicit suicidal desire. It also references emotional distress like feeling overwhelmed, difficulty coping, being in a rut, and having a small support system. The phrase ""I want to die tomorrow while my mom is out with family"" suggests a timeframe (""tomorrow"") and opportunity (mom being out), but no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or tools are mentioned. Preparations are implied but not explicit—""hit up everyone I have in my contacts"" could indicate reaching out or saying goodbye, but it's ambiguous and countered by ""try and go out"" or ""do my hw,"" showing ambivalence. The writer expresses conflict with ""I know I shouldn't"" and self-doubt with ""too weak and pathetic to do it,"" but the core desire to die is clear. No past actions or attempts are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts and ideations"" and ""I want to kill myself,"" which are direct expressions of a personal desire to die. The phrase ""I want to die tomorrow"" reinforces this intent in a context of despair. Although there is ambivalence (""I know I shouldn't""), the writer does not state that the thoughts are unwanted or that they lack a desire to die; instead, the desire is affirmed. This rules out 'Indicator' and points to 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned (e.g., no reference to pills, guns, or bridges). The timeframe ""tomorrow"" and the situation ""while my mom is out"" indicate opportunity but do not constitute a plan or method. ""Hit up everyone I have in my contacts"" could be interpreted as potential preparation (e.g., saying goodbye), but it is vague and coupled with alternatives like ""go out"" or ""do my hw,"" making it uncertain. Per the rules, if unsure about an explicit plan/method, 'Ideation' is chosen over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""tomorrow"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""I want to die tomorrow"" and ""I want to kill myself"" express intent, but there is no mention of concrete actions taken (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). The self-description as ""too weak... to do it"" implies no action has been initiated. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator'. The lack of a specific method or clear preparation (e.g., no details on how, with what, or where) means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'. With no initiated lethal actions described, 'Attempt' is not relevant. The presence of desire without a plan aligns with 'Ideation'. Ambivalence (""I know I shouldn't"") does not negate the desire but reinforces the thought-based nature.

I must be beyond saving if even my good days make me feel sad especially bc I know they won't last. I just want to cry and yeet myself way too much,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""beyond saving""), anhedonia (""still dead inside,"" ""still anhedonic""), and despair about the transient nature of ""good days."" 
   - The phrase ""yeet myself way too much"" uses slang (""yeet"") that implies a desire for self-harm or suicide, though it lacks specificity. 
   - No explicit mention of death, suicide, or specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons). 
   - No references to plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or past actions. 
   - Emotional tone centers on persistent sadness and hopelessness rather than imminent intent. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - ""Yeet myself"" suggests a desire to escape pain but is ambiguous; it could imply self-harm without lethal intent. The primary focus is distress about emotional numbness, not a clear wish to die. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned. ""Yeet myself"" is vague and lacks concrete details. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes ongoing emotional state (""still sad,"" ""still anhedonic"") and no past/recent actions. ""I just want to cry and yeet myself"" expresses a current urge, not an initiated act. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core theme is **distress about persistent sadness/hopelessness**, not an explicit desire to die. ""Yeet myself"" is concerning but ambiguous; without a clear plan/method or stated lethal intent, it aligns more with general distress. 
   - Rules: Absence of explicit suicidal desire, plan, or action supports **Indicator**. If uncertain between Indicator/Ideation (due to ""yeet myself""), the guideline prioritizes Indicator when desire is unclear.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions general distress: ""i fucked up,"" ""loser,"" hopelessness about life disruptions.  
   - Explicit past action: ""I tried to end it once before"" indicates a prior suicide attempt.  
   - Current emotional state: ""Sometimes I wish i succeeded"" expresses regret that the past attempt failed but **no current plan, method, or imminent intent**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""end it"" is a direct suicide reference.  
   - ""Wish I succeeded"" implies a lingering desire tied to the **past attempt**, not a current actionable urge.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current method, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Past attempt is referenced vaguely (no method/details), but the **action itself occurred**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Key phrase: ""I tried to end it once before"" confirms a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**.  
   - ""Sometimes I wish I succeeded"" reflects on the outcome of that past action, not a new plan.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicidal action (""tried to end it"") meets the definition of **Attempt** (initiated, potentially lethal).  
   - Current language expresses distress and regret but lacks new plans/preparations.  
   - Rule: Past concrete attempt takes precedence over current ideation/distress.

156,Can I please ! Talk to someone ? I'm having a bad panic attack. 18 and over please I just wanna kill myself out of fear,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""I just wanna kill myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide/self-harm.
   - Emotional indicators include ""bad panic attack"" and ""out of fear,"" showing distress and fear-driven despair.
   - No specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current feelings.
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated (""I just wanna kill myself""), but it is attributed to fear from the panic attack, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct and explicit mention of suicide.
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I just wanna kill myself"").
   - There is no statement negating the desire (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so it doesn't lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means).
   - The absence of a plan/method means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings (panic attack and suicidal thoughts) with no reference to past or recent actions.
   - No initiated suicidal actions are described, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes an explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""I just wanna kill myself""), which meets the threshold for 'Ideation'.
   - However, there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - The context of fear and panic does not negate the expressed desire, so it is not 'Indicator' (which requires a lack of clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - Since no past or recent actions are described, it cannot be 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the most appropriate category, as it captures the desire to die without specific plans or actions.

157,"Thought I was doing better. Now my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with. Every time I am back here, I feel more and more defeated. I'll never be out of this torture cycle, so why keep going?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""my brain is screaming at me to give up and just get it over with,"" which implies intrusive suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'll never be out of this torture cycle"") and defeat (""Every time I am back here, I feel more and more defeated"").  
   - **No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions** are described (e.g., no tools, locations, notes, or references to prior attempts).  
   - The phrase ""get it over with"" suggests a desire to end suffering but lacks explicit temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The writer attributes the urge to their ""brain screaming,"" but **does not explicitly negate the desire** (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Get it over with"" is a common euphemism for suicide in this context, paired with despair (""why keep going?""). The writer personally expresses a desire to escape their ""torture cycle"" through death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, or preparation (e.g., note, gathering means) is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current thoughts** (""my brain is screaming..."") and general despair, but **no past/initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""get it over with,"" ""why keep going?"") places this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of concrete past/current actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Fits *Ideation***: Expresses active suicidal thoughts and a personal wish to die without specifics.

158,"Please help. I'm really annoyed at people making fun at my spiritual beliefs like crystals, astrology, tarot, ect. And it happens A LOT. They just make me feel stupid for believing in something that not many people believe in. And it's not like any of them would stop and think about what they're doing, because they think we're just 'crazy' people that they can just make fun of for their entertainment. And I feel stupid for crying about it, because I feel like I'm a person who gets offended over everything. This is one of the reasons why I currently have suicidal thoughts. Thank you for listening.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes distress due to being mocked for spiritual beliefs, leading to feelings of stupidity and being overly sensitive. 
   - It explicitly mentions ""I currently have suicidal thoughts"" as a consequence of this distress. 
   - There are no references to death, dying, suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm. Emotional indicators include sadness and frustration, but not explicit hopelessness, despair, or burden. The temporal context is present-focused (""currently""), with no imminence (e.g., no ""tonight"" or ""soon""). The writer seeks help (""Please help"") and expresses gratitude for listening, indicating distress rather than a stated desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""
   - No, it does not express a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, it frames suicidal thoughts as a reaction to external events.
   - The writer does not explicitly state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them, but the context focuses on distress from mockery, not a genuine wish for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned. The reference to suicidal thoughts lacks any concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current suicidal thoughts only. There is no description of past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors. It is solely about thoughts, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit mention of ""suicidal thoughts"" suggests potential ideation, but the lack of a clear personal desire to die and the framing as a distress response create ambiguity. The primary sentiment is distress about being mocked, with suicidal thoughts presented as an outcome rather than an intent. 
   - Per the rules, if there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', 'Indicator' is chosen. Here, there is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior', and no described actions, ruling out 'Attempt'. The post lacks a current, personal expression of desire to die, aligning more closely with 'Indicator' (general distress with abstract suicide mention).

159,Anyone here genuinely upset that they are planning to commit suicide?. My life won't ever be the same again and I can't change my circumstances that much so far. I'll never be happy if I continue to live but I'm angry also because if it weren't for my situation I would be happy to continue living. So I'm missing out if I stay and will be miserable if I say and so I have to go. But the thought of going is also sad because I never got a fair shot at my dreams. Anyone relate at all? Anyone feel truly sad and mad that they have no choice but to end it? Or am I in the minority?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning to commit suicide"" and ""end it,"" indicating direct references to suicide. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'll never be happy if I continue to live""), despair (""I can't change my circumstances""), anger (""I'm angry""), and sadness about missing out on life. 
   - There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). 
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current feelings and future intentions. 
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). 
   - The writer expresses a desire to die (e.g., ""I have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and ""end it."" 
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I have to go,"" ""no choice but to end it""). 
   - No, the writer does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; instead, they frame it as necessary. This rules out 'Indicator' and supports 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is mentioned. 
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present. 
   - The phrase ""planning to commit suicide"" is vague and lacks concrete details about the plan. Per the rules, if unsure about an explicit plan/method, 'Ideation' should be chosen over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current/future intentions, not past events. 
   - No specific, potentially lethal action that was initiated (e.g., an attempt) is mentioned. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die, placing it above 'Indicator'. 
   - No specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. 
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'. 
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and desire without concrete plans or actions.

160,"Opened up to my family and i'm regretting it immensely. I'm having to move back in with my parents because I am not mentally stable enough to live alone. I had to tell my parents almost everything about what I've been struggling with and it was mortifying and embarrassing and I want to rip my hair out. I do not like living with them but it was either that or going through with attempting suicide. I feel nauseous just knowing what they know now. I was so close to attempting suicide  but in a moment of desperation I dumped everything on my mom in a text and now here I am, dropping out of college and planning the move back home. I'm dreading this because I honestly cannot stand living with my family.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions ""so close to attempting suicide"" and ""going through with attempting suicide,"" indicating past suicidal crisis.
    - Emotional indicators: regret, embarrassment, dread, feeling ""nauseous,"" and hopelessness about living situation.
    - References a past moment of being ""so close"" to attempting suicide but choosing to text their mom instead. **No specific method, plan, or preparation details** are provided about the near-attempt.
    - No current desire to die expressed; focus is on distress about moving home and family dynamics.
    - Temporal context: Past suicidal crisis (""was so close"") and current distress about consequences (moving home).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Explicit phrases: ""attempting suicide"" (mentioned twice). 
    - However, the context frames this as a **past alternative avoided** (""it was either that or..."") and an action **interrupted by reaching out** (""dumped everything on my mom""). 
    - **No current desire to die** is expressed; the writer focuses on discomfort with their family.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, hanging) described for the near-attempt. 
    - **No preparations** (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned. 
    - Texting the mom was a **coping action**, not a suicide preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - Describes being ""so close to attempting suicide"" in the past but **no initiated lethal action**. Reaching out to mom prevented an attempt. 
    - The phrase ""so close"" implies **strong ideation/intent but no concrete action taken**, as no method or initiation is specified.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Explicit mentions of suicide are **past-tense and avoided**, with no current desire expressed. 
    - **No plan/method/preparation** details support 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'. 
    - The core of the post is distress about familial shame and moving home, with suicidal thoughts framed as **unwanted/historical**. 
    - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress and abstract discussion of suicide as a past alternative, lacking current personal desire/plan.

161,I cant take it. I wont kill myself of course but the pain makes me want to scream and break everything in my vicinity. Its excruciating,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress (""I cant take it,"" ""the pain makes me want to scream,"" ""Its excruciating"") and mentions suicide (""kill myself"") but explicitly negates any intent with ""I wont kill myself of course."" There are no references to specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions. The emotional indicators (pain, frustration) are present, but the suicidal thought is framed as something the author rejects.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""kill myself""), but the author clearly states they do not want to act on it (""I wont kill myself of course""). This indicates the suicidal thought is unwanted and not a current personal desire to die, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain, not planning or behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current emotional distress, with no references to past or imminent actions, attempts, or timelines related to suicide.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post includes a mention of suicide but explicitly rejects the desire to act, fitting the 'Indicator' definition (expressing distress or unwanted suicidal thoughts without a genuine current desire to die). It does not show a personal desire for suicide (ruling out 'Ideation'), no plan/method (ruling out 'Behavior'), and no initiated action (ruling out 'Attempt'). The ambiguity rule also applies: when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.

162,I wish I could stop obsessing over appearance. All the females around me want to become prettier which has only intensified my gender dysphoria. I hate wearing makeup and putting on girly clothing. I want to be a male now.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses gender dysphoria, distress about societal pressures to conform to feminine standards (e.g., obsessing over appearance, wearing makeup, girly clothing), and a desire to transition to male. There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. Emotional indicators include distress, discomfort, and dissatisfaction, but no explicit hopelessness or despair tied to suicidal ideation. No past actions, plans, or imminence related to self-harm are present. The core sentiment is a wish to change gender identity, not to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of suicide, killing oneself, or similar phrases (No).
   - No expression of a desire to die or not be alive; the stated desire is ""I want to be a male now,"" which is about identity, not death (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so the question of unwanted thoughts does not apply.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of a specific suicide plan, method, tools, substances, locations, or preparations (e.g., nothing about pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and a present desire for gender transition, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses general distress (gender dysphoria, dissatisfaction with appearance) but lacks any personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past attempt. It fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes distress without clear suicidal intent. There is no ambiguity leaning toward 'Ideation' because suicidal desire is absent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions self-hatred (""hate myself"") and wishing for courage to ""end it all,"" indicating suicidal ideation.
   - Expresses hopelessness (""loathe my existence"") but counters with resilience (""want the courage to endure,"" ""stay around"").
   - Explicitly references suicidal intent (""end it all"") but frames it as lacking courage to act.
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations described.
   - Focuses on encouraging others (""you aren't alone,"" ""you are loved"") and emphasizes enduring pain.
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings (""Today was another bad day"") with no past or recent suicidal actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, ""end it all"" is a direct suicidal phrase.
   - However, the writer negates acting on it (""wish I had the courage"" implies inaction) and emphasizes enduring/staying. Suicidal thoughts are framed as *unwanted* due to lack of courage/conviction.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of a plan, method, tools, or preparations. Only abstract desire (""end it all"") without concrete details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions. Focuses on current feelings and future hope (""stay around"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit suicidal language is present (""end it all""), but the writer consistently disclaims intent by stressing a lack of courage, a desire to endure, and encouragement to others.
   - No plan/method/preparation exists, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past/current action described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The core sentiment is distress about suicidal thoughts *without* a genuine current desire to act (emphasizing endurance and hope), aligning with 'Indicator' per guidelines:  
     *""If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted... lean towards 'Indicator'.""*  
     *""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""*

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""almost committed suicide a few days ago"" due to lacking means (""didn't have anything to do it with""), followed by ""yet i still consider,"" indicating ongoing suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional distress is evident (severe anxiety, isolation, family conflict).  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is described (only a barrier: lacking means).  
   - The phrase ""almost committed suicide"" implies contemplation but **no initiated action** (since no means were available).  
   - Temporal context: Past ideation (""a few days ago"") and current consideration (""still consider"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""almost committed suicide"" and ""still consider"" suicide, confirming a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method/preparation**: Mentions lacking means but does not describe a plan, tool, location, or concrete preparations. The barrier (no means) negates actionable behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past suicidal thoughts (""almost committed"") but **no initiated action** (emphasizes inability due to lacking means). ""Still consider"" confirms ongoing ideation without current behavior.  
   - No description of a concrete past/current lethal action (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm attempt).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (suicidal intent) → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No method/plan/preparation described** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No initiated, potentially lethal action** (past or recent) → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Core elements: Ongoing suicidal thoughts (""still consider"") + past ideation without plan/action → Fits *Ideation*.

   - The post repeatedly uses the word ""suicide"" directly (""suicide with me,"" ""anyone suicide with me,"" ""want to suicide"").  
   - It expresses a clear desire for joint suicide (""suicide with me together"") and targets others who share suicidal intent.  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, burden) beyond the suicidal invitation.  
   - No past actions or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are described; the focus is on recruiting others for a future act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly uses ""suicide"" multiple times in a personal context (e.g., ""suicide with me"").  
   - **Yes**: It conveys a direct desire to die by seeking partners for suicide.  
   - **No**: There is no negation of desire (e.g., no statements like ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned. The phrasing is general and lacks concrete planning details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future intention (""can anyone suicide with me"") but **no past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no reference to trying a method).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** is present (sufficient for 'Ideation').  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned (rules out 'Behavior').  
   - **No description of past/initiated actions** (rules out 'Attempt').  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: The author’s personal desire to die is explicit and unnegated.

I have always said that when I kill myself I will have my apartment packed up and already be resigned from my job and have money set aside for my family. I haven't done any of that but I can't stop thinking about killing myself. I put the rope around my neck and ‘practice' hung for a minute or two but I stopped mainly because I am afraid of failing and ending up in ICU but also because nothing is ready. But I'm sitting here and I can't focus on anything except trying again. It is what I deserve and I don't feel like I can wait any longer but I feel so scared for some reason too. Scared of failing I think. I am a burden to my family and friends, a liability to my coworker and now I am here being a burden on internet strangers. I am just grasping at straws here I guess",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""I want to kms"" (kill myself), ""hang myself"", ""kill myself"", ""put the rope around my neck"", ""practice hung"", ""trying again"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I am a burden""), fear of failing, feeling undeserving.  
   - Specific method: Hanging (using a rope).  
   - Preparations: Mentions packing, resigning, setting aside money (but states these are incomplete).  
   - Past action: Describes putting a rope around their neck and ""practicing"" hanging for 1-2 minutes before stopping.  
   - Imminence: ""right now,"" ""can't wait any longer,"" and current urge to ""try again.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I want to kms,"" ""hang myself,"" ""kill myself,"" ""can't stop thinking about killing myself.""  
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""It is what I deserve"") without negating the desire. Fear of failure/complications is noted, but this doesn't negate intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (hanging with a rope) and preparations (acquiring rope, ""practicing"").  
   - Action taken: ""Put the rope around my neck"" and simulated hanging.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past/recent self-initiated action**: Putting a rope around their neck and engaging in ""practice"" hanging for 1-2 minutes. This is a concrete, potentially lethal act (stopped due to fear of failure, not lack of intent).  
   - Also expresses ongoing urges to act *now*.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post goes beyond ideation/planning due to the **initiated action** (using the rope).  
   - The ""practice"" hanging is a potentially lethal act that was stopped by the author. This meets the definition of **Attempt** (""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... interrupted by self"").  
   - Current ideation/behavior is present but is secondary to the described concrete action.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit suicidal desire**: Phrases like ""I'm finally doing it,"" ""I think I'm finally going to actually do it,"" ""I just want to fucking die,"" and ""I don't want to be here any more"" indicate a strong personal desire to die.  
   - **Method mentioned**: References considering a gun (""I've always thought I was going to get a gun"") but explicitly states uncertainty (""I don't know how exactly I'm going to do it"").  
   - **Preparations/Plan**: No concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun, setting a time/location) described. The post focuses on emotional distress and intent but lacks actionable steps.  
   - **Temporal context**: Expresses imminent intent (""finally doing it,"" ""it's finally fucking time"") but describes no past or recent self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Hopelessness (""I'm a fucking failure""), burden (""didn't want to be a bigger burden""), despair, and anhedonia.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I want to fucking die,"" ""suicidal ideation,"" and ""this job was making me suicidal"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Method vaguely referenced**: Gun is mentioned as a past thought (""I've always thought..."") but explicitly lacks current specificity (""I don't know how exactly"").  
   - **No preparations**: No evidence of acquiring tools, writing notes, or setting plans.  
   - **Conclusion**: Method is uncertain and not actionable, so **not** sufficient for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Future intention**: Focuses on intent to act soon but describes **no past/current initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  
   - **Past events**: References prior suicidal ideation and distress but no concrete suicidal acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I want to fucking die"") and personal suicidal intent place this beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While a method (gun) is referenced, it is explicitly uncertain and not planned/prepared. Rules state: ""If unsure about plan/method, choose 'Ideation'.""  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Final**: Strong suicidal desire with no plan/preparation → **Ideation**.

168,"Thank you for being here. It helps knowing I'm not alone and that even if people in my life are pretty apathetic about my existing, there might be someone reading this who doesn't want me dead. I just finished driving up to the mountains with full intentions to end things. It was impulsive and I don't think I'm going to do it. I want to sleep and fast travel to a time when I feel like myself, or just sleep and sleep and sleep and be numb. There is really good cell reception in the mountains, lol, and I keep thinking these stupid magical thoughts like 'maybe someone will call me knowing that I'm at the edge'. Is that pathetic?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions driving to the mountains with ""full intentions to end things,"" indicating a suicidal plan tied to a specific location (mountains). 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""people in my life are apathetic about my existing""), impulsivity, and numbness. 
   - The writer describes a recent action (driving to the mountains) with suicidal intent but states they did not follow through (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). 
   - There is no description of a lethal action being initiated (e.g., no mention of jumping, overdosing, etc.). 
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated (""end things""), but the writer now expresses ambivalence about acting on it.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: ""end things"" is a direct reference to suicide. 
   - **Yes**: ""full intentions to end things"" confirms a desire to die at the time of the action. 
   - The writer later negates the current intent (""I don't think I'm going to do it""), but the explicit desire was present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Yes**: A specific location (mountains) is mentioned as part of the plan. 
   - **Yes**: Preparations were made (driving to the location). 
   - No method is detailed, but the context implies a method (e.g., jumping) associated with the location.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes a recent preparatory action (driving to the mountains) for suicide. 
   - **No lethal action was initiated**: The writer did not attempt to harm themselves (""I don't think I'm going to do it""). 
   - The behavior (driving with intent) is preparatory, not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die and a specific plan/location (""mountains"") place this beyond 'Indicator' or 'Ideation'. 
   - Preparatory actions (driving to the location) align with 'Behavior'. 
   - No initiated lethal action occurred, ruling out 'Attempt'. 
   - The post focuses on **current planning/preparation** despite ambivalence afterward.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of death (""I'm ready to die"", ""go out"") and emotional indicators like hopelessness (""nothing in my life is changing"", ""fuck this world""). It references a specific plan (""The date was set a while ago. I even changed it"") and preparations (""Preps being made for me to go out the way I want"", ""I'm strapped in and ready to go""). The phrase ""strapped in"" may imply a method (e.g., vehicle-related or self-restraint), but no specific method is detailed. There is no description of past initiated actions; the focus is on future intent and current preparations. The author expresses a clear, unreserved desire to die (e.g., ""I'm ready""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions death (""I'm ready to die"") and expresses a clear, personal desire to die, without any negation (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, there is mention of a plan (""The date was set a while ago"") and explicit preparations (""Preps being made""). ""Strapped in"" suggests a method is involved, though not specified. This indicates planning elements, leaning toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past planning (""date was set... changed it"") and current/future intentions (""ready to go""), but no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no attempt like ""I took pills""). Preparations are ongoing, but not an action. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author has explicit suicidal desire (ruling out 'Indicator') and includes planning/preparation elements (ruling out 'Ideation'). No initiated lethal action is described (ruling out 'Attempt'). The combination of desire and preparations fits 'Behavior'.

I still sleep in class but my teachers now dont care much which i guess is good.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states, ""Im thinking of ending my life,"" directly expressing suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (hating their course, feeling trapped), isolation (friends ditching them), and past struggles (depression, OCD, academic failure).  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation (e.g., pills, location, note) is mentioned.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated but not negated as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""ending my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**, the statement reflects a current personal desire to die (""thinking of"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing thoughts; they are presented as active considerations.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means).  
   - The post focuses on circumstances (academic struggles, isolation) but lacks concrete planning elements.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses past events (academic failure, OCD) and current distress but **no initiated suicidal actions**.  
   - References to ""sleeping in class"" or ""lashing out"" are behavioral issues, not suicidal acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** places this above *Indicator* (which requires absence of personal suicidal desire).  
   - **Absence of method/plan/preparation** rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/recent suicidal actions** rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is current suicidal thoughts without escalation to planning or action → **Ideation**.

171,its working!. hopefully this is my last post on here. pls let me never wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes phrases like ""hopefully this is my last post on here"" and ""pls let me never wake up,"" which express a desire to cease living or not continue existence. Key elements:
     - Mentions of death/dying: ""never wake up"" implies a wish for death, specifically through not regaining consciousness.
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness and despair are evident in the plea to ""never wake up"" and the hope that this is the last post.
     - Specific plans/methods/preparations: ""never wake up"" is vague and does not specify a method (e.g., no mention of pills, tools, locations, or actions like writing a note). ""its working!"" is ambiguous—it could imply an ongoing action, but without context, it is unclear what ""working"" refers to and whether it relates to a suicidal act. No explicit preparations are described.
     - References to past actions: None; the post focuses on future desires (""hopefully,"" ""let me"").
     - Imminence: The word ""hopefully"" and the plea ""pls"" suggest a wish rather than an immediate plan, with no time frame like ""tonight"" or ""soon.""
     - Stated desire: The author expresses a genuine wish to die (e.g., ""never wake up""), not distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it clearly expresses a personal desire to die through ""pls let me never wake up"" and the implication of not posting again. The desire is not negated as unwanted; it is presented as a genuine wish. Therefore, this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Never wake up"" is a desired outcome but not a concrete plan or method. The phrase ""its working!"" is unclear and could be interpreted as an action in progress, but it lacks detail to confirm a suicidal method or preparation. Without explicit evidence of a plan, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future-oriented wishes (""hopefully,"" ""let me"") with no reference to past or recent actions. ""its working!"" might imply an ongoing process, but it is vague and does not describe a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I took pills"" or ""I tried to hang myself""). Thus, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""never wake up""), which aligns with 'Ideation'. However, there is no clear plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'. The vague nature of ""never wake up"" and the ambiguity of ""its working!"" do not provide sufficient evidence for a specific plan, so 'Ideation' is more appropriate than 'Behavior'. The lack of any past action also rules out 'Attempt'. While there is distress, the explicit desire to die means 'Indicator' is not the best fit, as 'Indicator' is for cases without personal suicidal intent or where such thoughts are unwanted.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific means: ""42 unnamed pills"" (old antidepressants) and ""allergy medicine,"" both described as small and easy to swallow.  
   - Expresses explicit desire: ""im so ready to die"" and ""tonight im gonna do it.""  
   - References past ideation without action (""saying im gonna do it but then i never do"") but emphasizes current preparedness: ""this time i actually have the means to.""  
   - No description of a past/initiated action; focus is on future intent (""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""im gonna do it"" (contextually refers to suicide) and ""ready to die"" show a clear personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Specific methods (swallowing pills) and means (antidepressants/allergy pills) are mentioned. Preparation is evident (""i have the means"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future intent (""tonight""). No description of a past initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of taking pills previously).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Specific method (pills) and means are mentioned** → Upgrades from *Ideation* to *Behavior*.  
   - **No initiated action described** → Rules out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: tiredness, loneliness, feeling unloved, anxiety, hopelessness.  
   - Explicitly states: ""kill myself"" as a perceived solution to emotional pain.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes, weapons) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or initiated actions.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings and current thoughts (""more and more often""), but no imminent timeline (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, directly states ""kill myself"" as a solution to escape suffering.  
   - Expresses a genuine desire to die (""I want to be done with everything,"" ""the only way... would be to... kill myself"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed abstractly (""the only way"") without actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current emotional state and ideation.  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts are present → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No plan, method, or preparation mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Falls under *Ideation*: Clear expression of suicidal desire without specific plans or preparatory steps.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post repeatedly expresses a strong desire to ""check out"" (a common euphemism for suicide/death) and explicitly states ""I really want to check out"" and ""how much I want to check out."" 
    - It acknowledges a lack of moral objections to suicide and indifference to the impact on others. 
    - The only barrier mentioned is ""spite,"" which the author indicates is waning (""even spite has its limits""). 
    - No specific suicide method, plan, tools, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned. 
    - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - ""Check out"" is not a direct phrase like ""suicide,"" but in context, it strongly implies a desire to die (e.g., ""I really want to check out""). 
    - The author explicitly desires death but attributes their inaction solely to ""spite."" There is no statement rejecting the desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to act on this""). → **Yes, explicit desire to die**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - No method (e.g., pills, hanging), plan details, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are mentioned. The barrier (""spite"") is emotional, not logistical. → **No plan/method/preparation**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes current feelings and a potential future breakdown of barriers (""spite has its limits"") but no concrete past or recent actions (e.g., ""I tried""). → **No initiated action**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - **Explicit desire to die** is present (""I really want to check out""), ruling out 'Indicator'. 
    - **No plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses extreme emotional distress (""i cant do this anymore,"" ""im in so much pain,"" ""i cant handle it anymore,"" ""im done"").  
   - The phrase ""im going to do it"" implies intent but lacks explicit mention of death, suicide, or self-harm.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan details, preparations (e.g., note-writing), or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  
   - The writer thanks others and expresses hope for others to ""find something to live for,"" which may suggest a farewell tone but does not confirm suicidal action.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness and overwhelm, but **suicide/death is not explicitly referenced**.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die"" appear.  
   - ""Im going to do it"" is ambiguous—it could imply suicidal intent but is not definitive. Without explicit language, genuine desire to die is unclear.  
   - **Leans toward 'Indicator'** due to ambiguity and absence of direct suicidal statements.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No method, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned.  
   - The vagueness of ""do it"" does not qualify as a plan. Without specifics, this rules out 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post discusses a future intention (""im going to do it"") but **no past or recent actions** (e.g., ""I tried"") are described.  
   - No evidence of initiated, potentially lethal behavior. Rules out 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress and hopelessness, but the **lack of explicit suicidal desire, plan, or past action** places this in 'Indicator'.  
   - Ambiguous phrases like ""do it"" are insufficient to escalate to 'Ideation' without clearer intent.  
   - Per rules: When unsure between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, choose 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly asks for ""a mostly painless way to kill myself,"" directly mentioning suicide and seeking methods.  
   - Emotional indicators include high stress, feeling life is ""easier"" through suicide, and hopelessness about their future (""never really seen myself going anywhere"").  
   - There is no mention of specific tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes).  
   - The desire to die is explicit (""kill myself""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  
   - No past actions or attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct statement of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**, the post expresses a genuine desire to die to escape stress and hopelessness (e.g., ""it would just be a lot easier"").  
   - The writer does *not* negate or express distress about these thoughts; they rationalize them.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - The request for a ""mostly painless way"" implies **method-seeking**, but no specific method, plan, or preparation is stated (e.g., no named tools, locations, or actions like acquiring means).  
   - This is ambiguous: seeking methods suggests planning, but the absence of concrete details leans toward **Ideation** per the rule: *""If unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""*  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **current/future** intentions only. No past actions or attempts are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator?** No—explicit personal desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior?**  
     - Strong explicit desire (""kill myself"") → **Ideation**.  
     - Method-seeking implies planning but lacks specificity (e.g., ""pills"" or ""bridge""). Per rules: *""If unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation'.""*

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post is a warning against suicide by overdose, detailing the painful and non-peaceful process. It explicitly discusses suicide methods (""overdosing,"" ""take the pills"") and consequences (vomiting, liver damage, death). However, the author is **not** expressing personal suicidal intent. Instead, they are cautioning others (""Don't take the pills,"" ""you'll feel fine,"" ""you'll start vomiting"") and debunking misconceptions. There are no personal expressions of hopelessness, burden, or desire to die. The tone is informational and dissuasive, focused on preventing others from attempting suicide via this method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: While suicide is explicitly mentioned (""commit suicide,"" ""end it with pills""), the author does **not** express a personal desire to die. The language is directed at a general ""you"" (e.g., ""you'll start vomiting,"" ""you'll become jaundiced""), indicating the author is describing hypothetical or general scenarios, not their own feelings or intentions. The author’s stance is explicitly preventative (""Don't take the pills""). No personal suicidal desire is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: The post details a method (overdosing) and its consequences but **does not** indicate the author has a plan, means, or preparations for themselves. The discussion of methods is impersonal and cautionary.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: No past or recent suicidal actions by the author are described. The post focuses solely on general risks of overdose.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly to warn others but **lacks any personal expression of desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions by the author**.  
   - The core message is general distress about suicide risks (albeit framed as advice), placing it in ""Indicator.""  
   - Rules clarification: The suicide risk applies only to the author, and no personal intent/action is evident. Ambiguity about suicidal desire defaults to ""Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions suicidal intent with phrases like ""im positive im gonna do it"" and ""ill do it when im fed up of this,"" where ""do it"" implies suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no motivation to keep on living"") and a sense of being a burden (""i dont want my family to be sad""). No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations are described. The timeline is future-oriented (""in the future,"" ""when im fed up""), not immediate. The writer states they are not ready now (""im not ready,"" ""im good rn""), which indicates the thoughts are not currently being acted upon, but the underlying desire to die is present.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear personal desire to die through phrases like ""no motivation to keep on living"" and ""im positive im gonna do it."" While ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" isn't explicitly used, ""do it"" is a direct euphemism for suicide in this context. The writer does not state that the thoughts are unwanted; instead, they express a genuine wish to die, postponed only by concern for family.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The references to acting ""in the future"" or ""when im fed up"" are vague and lack concrete details about how the suicide would be carried out. Without a plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""in the future,"" ""ill do it when im fed up"") with no description of past or recent suicidal actions. The writer emphasizes their current state (""im good rn""), confirming no action has been initiated. Thus, there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""im positive im gonna do it"") and lack of a specific plan or method align with 'Ideation'. The writer's distress about living and suicidal thoughts are personal and current, but the absence of planning elements rules out 'Behavior'. The mention of not being ready now and concern for family does not negate the suicidal desire; it merely delays it, so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. No past actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The post clearly expresses suicidal ideation without crossing into planning or action.

179,I fucking hate my parents for having me. They literally just wanted a baby because 'that's part of life' and it's just resulted in a human being (me) living a life psychologically tortured. They could even find the time to care for me.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger and resentment towards parents for bringing the author into existence.  
   - Key phrases: ""hate my parents for having me,"" ""living a life psychologically tortured,"" ""couldn't find the time to care for me.""  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or plans.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""psychologically tortured""), feeling uncared for, and distress about existence.  
   - **No references** to suicidal desire, plans, preparations, past actions, or temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Focus: Distress about life circumstances and parental neglect, **not** a wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Describes suffering but **no expression of a desire to end life**.  
   - The sentiment is anger at parents, **not** personal suicidal intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: Leans strongly toward 'Indicator' due to absence of suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or plans.  
   - Entirely focused on emotional distress, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing suffering** with no reference to past/current suicidal actions.  
   - **No initiated actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted efforts) described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks explicit personal desire to die**, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Expresses existential anguish and psychological pain without suicidal intent.  
   - Rules applied:  
     - Ambiguity about suicidal desire defaults to 'Indicator'.

180,"Dreamt of a group of foreign men, mass murdering people for what seemed like fun. I'm not sure why I dreamt this but I woke up to a severe panic attack. I have no outstanding issues with men, nor foreigners however this felt like a real threat and absolutely terrified me. It started with them coming out and charging into a school, one that I know of. There was about 5 of them, they ran around and started slicing up as many people as they could. Dispersing all over the school to do the most damage. I remember the sheer panic and the realness of it and then making my way to my home to be safe, telling my family of it. A few of them then broke into my home, which looked like my actual home and went on a crazed rampage. I jolted awake right at this time but it was absolutely terrifying, even as I was awake. Does anyone have any clue why I would have such a vivid dream about this? Or even how to deal with it so I can avoid them as Ive been anxious to sleep after my dreams being so intense",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post describes a vivid, terrifying nightmare about a mass murder scenario, leading to a severe panic attack upon waking. The user expresses intense fear and anxiety about the dream's realism and its impact on their ability to sleep. 
    - **No mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations related to the *author themselves*. The focus is entirely on an external threat in a dream. 
    - Emotional indicators are **fear, panic, and anxiety**, but these stem from the nightmare, not personal hopelessness, despair, or suicidal desire. The author seeks understanding of the dream and coping strategies, not relief from suicidal thoughts. 
    - **No explicit or implied desire** for the author to die or engage in self-harm. The author's distress is about the dream's intensity and its aftermath (panic, sleep anxiety). 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No**. The post contains no phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or any equivalent expression of personal suicidal desire. The only death-related content involves the *dreamed attackers* killing others, not the author harming themselves. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - **No**. There is no mention of any plan, method, tools, or preparations for suicide or self-harm by the author. The described violence is part of the dream narrative, not a real or intended action by the author. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - **No**. The post describes a distressing dream and its emotional aftermath. It does not describe any past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal action by the author (e.g., no overdose, self-harm attempt). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The post expresses **significant distress and anxiety** caused by a nightmare and its lingering effects. 
    - There is **no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, preparation, or past attempt** by the author. 
    - The distress is focused on the fear from the dream experience and its impact on sleep, not on suicidal ideation. 
    - This fits the **'Indicator'** category: expressing general distress without a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire, intent, plan, or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post mentions ""ive overdosed twice once accidental once on purpose,"" explicitly describing a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (overdose) with suicidal intent (""on purpose"").  
   - Emotional indicators include ""fear and despair,"" ""end this suffering,"" and expressions of hopelessness (""i don't want to believe theres nothing"").  
   - The phrase ""i just need something to believe in so i can do it"" suggests current suicidal ideation (where ""do it"" implies acting on suicidal thoughts), but **no specific plan, method, or preparation for a future attempt is mentioned**.  
   - The overdose described as ""on purpose"" is a concrete past action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes. ""so i can do it"" (contextually linked to ending suffering) and the description of a past intentional overdose confirm a desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - A method (overdose) is referenced but **only in the context of a past attempt**. No current/future plan, method, or preparation is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes a **past potentially lethal action** (""overdosed... once on purpose"") initiated by the author. This qualifies as a suicide attempt under the definition.  
   - Current expressions (""need something to believe in so i can do it"") indicate ideation but no imminent action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The explicit description of a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (intentional overdose) meets the criteria for **Attempt**, regardless of concurrent ideation.  
   - While the post includes current distress and suicidal thoughts, **Attempt takes precedence** due to the concrete past action.  
   - No current plan/preparation elevates it from Ideation/Behavior, but the historical attempt is the defining factor.

I'm hurting my significant other because of my low mood. I haven't told him what's bothering me and I'm scared to stress him even more,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal again,"" indicating current suicidal thoughts.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I thought I was getting better but...""), distress over relationship strain (""hurting my significant other""), and fear of burdening others (""scared to stress him"").  
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills as a means), locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools) are mentioned. Running out of meds is contextual but not framed as a method.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  
   - The temporal context focuses on *current* emotional state and logistical issues (medication access), with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") for acting on thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states ""I'm suicidal again,"" directly expressing personal suicidal intent. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. Running out of meds is a stressor, not a stated method for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes *current* suicidal thoughts and distress. No past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."") are referenced.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal desire (""I'm suicidal"") is present → **not Indicator**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation described → **not Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions → **not Attempt**.  
   - Suicidal thoughts with desire but no actionable plan → **Ideation**.

It's just too hard.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress, anxiety, hopelessness (""I can't have this life it's too painful""), and feelings of failure. It explicitly mentions a desire to die (""now I want to die more than ever"") in the context of despair. There are no references to specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the focus is on current emotional pain and relational conflict with the mother. The phrase ""want to die"" indicates a personal desire, but it lacks details on plans or imminent actions (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die with ""now I want to die more than ever."" This is a personal and current statement of suicidal intent, not abstract or unwanted thoughts. There is no negation (e.g., no indication the thoughts are unwanted), so it leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The content focuses on emotional distress and the desire to die without any planning elements. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires but no past or recent suicidal actions. References to failure (""Everytime I try I fail"") are general and not linked to concrete suicidal behaviors. No initiated, potentially lethal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""want to die"") confirms 'Ideation' as the writer personally expresses suicidal thoughts. The lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The absence of past actions rules out 'Attempt'. While there is distress, the clear suicidal intent distinguishes this from 'Indicator' (which would apply if the thoughts were unwanted or if death was only vaguely referenced without desire). Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

184,"Is suicide by hanging a long and painful experience?. ive alr tied the noose, although im still not sure. i dont want lied to if it is or not, please be honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and asks about the experience, indicating serious consideration of the method.  
   - Key elements: Specific method (hanging), preparation (""tied the noose""), emotional uncertainty (""still not sure""), and a request for honesty about lethality/pain.  
   - No explicit desire to live or rejection of suicidal thoughts is stated (e.g., no phrase like ""I don’t want to do this"").  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no description of starting/attempting hanging).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly mentions ""suicide by hanging"" and describes personal involvement (""I’ve alr tied the noose"").  
   - **Yes**, the context implies a genuine desire to understand the method's consequences, suggesting contemplation of acting on suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**, a specific method (hanging) is explicitly named.  
   - **Yes**, concrete preparation is confirmed (""tied the noose""). This indicates tangible steps toward a suicidal act.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The preparation (tying the noose) is described as completed (""alr tied""), but no *initiated lethal action* (e.g., placing the noose around the neck, starting the act) is mentioned.  
   - Focus is on current uncertainty about the method, not a past/ongoing attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is implied through method inquiry and preparation.  
   - Specific method + preparation (""tied the noose"") aligns with **Behavior** (plan/preparation elements present).  
   - No description of an *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I tried hanging myself"") rules out **Attempt**.  
   - **Not Indicator/Ideation**: Unambiguous personal desire and preparation exceed the threshold for ""Indicator"" (unwanted thoughts) or ""Ideation"" (desire without plan/prep).

185,I'm a pervert. Should I kill myself? I've never done anything wrong or illegal. I'm just a pervert. I can't help my sexual feelings. I want to die because of them.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes direct mentions of suicide: ""Should I kill myself?"" and ""I want to die because of them.""
   - Emotional indicators are present, such as distress about being a ""pervert,"" hopelessness about uncontrollable sexual feelings, and a stated desire to die.
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means).
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts are made; the focus is on current feelings and thoughts.
   - No imminence is indicated (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the post poses a question and expresses a desire but lacks concrete timing.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die due to their feelings, as seen in ""I want to die because of them."" The question ""Should I kill myself?"" suggests contemplation but does not explicitly negate the desire or frame the thoughts as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die with ""I want to die because of them."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the writer is resisting acting on them (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The post focuses on the writer's feelings and the question of whether to act, but there is no evidence of planning or readiness. This leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and desires, not past actions. There is no description of any initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed). The statement ""I've never done anything wrong or illegal"" refers to sexual behavior, not suicide, and does not indicate a past attempt. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The writer explicitly expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts (""I want to die,"" ""Should I kill myself?""), which fits 'Ideation'.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, so it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which would apply only if the desire was negated or the thoughts were clearly unwanted.

Conclusion: The post falls under 'Ideation' because it contains explicit expressions of suicidal desire and thoughts, but lacks any specific plan, method, or preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger and hatred towards the father and family, referencing past sexual assault trauma. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i hate everything"") and despair. 
   - The phrase ""i just wanna end it"" explicitly references suicidal intent. 
   - No specific method, plan, preparation, timeline, or past suicidal actions are mentioned.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""End it"" is a direct colloquial expression for suicide or dying, indicating a personal desire to die. The context (despair, trauma, hatred) reinforces this as genuine suicidal intent. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I won't"") or expression of unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""end it"" is general and lacks concrete planning details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes current emotional distress and a desire to die but does not reference any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). The focus is on present feelings/thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""i just wanna end it"") meets the threshold for **Ideation**. 
   - Absence of any plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**. 
   - No description of past/current concrete actions rules out **Attempt**. 
   - While distress is severe, the explicit suicidal desire prevents classification as **Indicator**.

187,"Consider going hobo. Hi people. I just want to point out the alternative for anyone on the brink of suicide. There have been more than a few occasions in my life where I felt like I couldn't cope. On two of those occasions I hit the road and went vagrant. Living in squats, sleeping on cardboard boxes, begging or stealing to keep fed. Its not a great situation, but on both occasions it was better than the predicaments that preceded it. And it has a few perks: you get to walk away from anything that is bothering you, you don't have to go to a shitty day job, you get to drift north n south with the season, and you don't have to give any fucks. None at all. I am a functional member of society at the moment, but the road has saved me in the past, and it's a comfort to know it's there should I ever need it again. Good luck people.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses being ""on the brink of suicide"" as a past experience (twice) and frames ""going hobo"" as an alternative coping strategy.  
   - Mentions feelings of inability to cope historically but positions homelessness as a solution, not a current expression of despair.  
   - No explicit current desire to die, self-harm, or suicide methods. Instead, it emphasizes the road as a ""comfort"" and escape from distress.  
   - Emotional tone is reflective and pragmatic, focusing on resilience and a backup plan (""it’s a comfort to know it’s there"").  
   - No references to plans, methods, preparations, or recent/potential actions related to suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Mentions ""brink of suicide"" in a historical context but **does not express current personal desire to die or commit suicide**.  
   - The author explicitly positions vagrancy as an alternative *to* suicide, implying a rejection of acting on past suicidal feelings.  
   - No current suicidal ideation expressed; the focus is on past coping and future reassurance.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** for suicide is mentioned. The only concrete actions described are past instances of becoming homeless.  
   - Homelessness is framed as a *distraction/solution*, not a step toward suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past** feelings (""on two occasions"") and **past** actions (going vagrant).  
   - No description of any initiated suicidal act (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose but chose homelessness instead"").  
   - Current status: ""functional member of society,"" with homelessness as a hypothetical future fallback.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post references suicidal feelings **historically** but lacks a **current personal desire to die**, specific plan, or preparatory behavior.  
   - The core message is general distress management (using homelessness as an alternative to suicide), aligning with **Indicator**.  
   - Ambiguity about past suicidal intent is resolved by the author’s explicit framing of homelessness as a life-preserving choice, further supporting **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""end it"" as a direct reference to suicide and expresses despair (""I can't go on anymore,"" ""I fucked up my life"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, loneliness, and anhedonia (""I miss being happy"").  
   - A temporal cue (""tonight"") suggests imminent intent.  
   - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., pills, note) are mentioned.  
   - The author expresses a desire to die (""end it"") without stating these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""end it"" is a direct suicidal phrase.  
   - Yes: ""I can't go on anymore"" and ""end it"" confirm a desire to die.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions possessing 800mg codeine and having access to ibuprofen, directly linking these substances to a question about ending their life (""Will I be able to successfully end my life?""). Physical characteristics (height, weight) are provided to assess lethality. This indicates a specific method (drug overdose) and possession of means.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. The phrase ""end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent, and the question format implies a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The author explicitly states they *have* 800mg codeine and *access* to ibuprofen, indicating possession of means for a specific method (overdose). The question about success further confirms active planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post discusses a *future* action (""Will I be able to..."") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die is present (**Ideation** requirement met).  
   - Specific method (overdose) and possession/access to means (codeine/ibuprofen) are confirmed, satisfying **Behavior** criteria.  
   - No description of past/initiated actions rules out **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""i failed everything,"" ""i wasted it,"" ""not happy or enjoying anythnig""), and a history of resisting suicidal urges (""spent my whole life resisting the desire to end""). It mentions a desire to not be alive (""ran out of reasons to keep myself alive,"" ""i cant live like this,"" ""cant stand being here"") but frames the suicidal urge as something actively resisted. No specific plan, method, preparation, timeline, or past suicidal action is described. The core sentiment is profound despair and unwanted suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: While phrases like ""desire to end"" imply suicidal thoughts, the author explicitly states they have been *resisting* this desire, indicating the thoughts are unwanted and do not represent a current, active wish to die (""spent my whole life resisting the desire to end""). There is no direct phrase like ""kill myself"" or clear statement of *wanting* to die. The distress centers on suffering, not a stated intent to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No specific suicide method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The focus is on emotional pain and the struggle against suicidal urges, not planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post describes ongoing feelings of despair and a lifelong resistance to suicidal urges. It does not describe any specific, initiated suicidal action (past or recent). The phrase ""tried to"" or similar language indicating action is absent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The post expresses suicidal thoughts (""desire to end"") but explicitly frames them as unwanted and resisted (""resisting""). This aligns with the Indicator definition: distress and *unwanted* suicidal thoughts without a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die. The absence of any plan/method/preparation further supports this.
   - **Ideation/Behavior/Attempt Ruled Out**: No explicit desire to die *now* (only resisted historical urges), no plan/method/preparation, and no description of past or recent concrete suicidal actions. The intense hopelessness and suffering are present, but the suicidal element is characterized as a resisted burden, not an active intent or plan.

**Conclusion**: The primary content is profound distress and the experience of *unwanted* suicidal thoughts, meeting the criteria for 'Indicator'. The explicit resistance to the ""desire to end"" is the key differentiator from 'Ideation'.

191,SMI. How do you tell the people you love that you will probably commit suicide eventually?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" as a future probability (""will probably commit suicide eventually""). The core question is about communicating this to loved ones. There is a clear expression of suicidal intent but no mention of specific methods, tools, locations, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or timelines beyond the vague ""eventually."" No past actions or attempts are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. The phrase ""will probably commit suicide"" directly expresses a personal desire to die by suicide. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to"") or indication that these thoughts are unwanted/distressing without intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: No. The post references a general future possibility but lacks any details about a plan (how, when, where), method (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., gathering means). The word ""eventually"" implies no immediacy or concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The post discusses a future intention (""will probably"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried yesterday""). It is purely prospective.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""commit suicide"") is present → Rules out **Indicator**.

Will anyone read this?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - Mentions ""voices I'm hearing keep telling me to just end myself"" (suicidal ideation from external/internal voices). 
    - Expresses emotional distress: hopelessness (""losing grip,"" ""can't cope""), isolation (""don't know who to turn to""), guilt (""stupid financial mistakes""), and tearfulness.
    - Explicitly states **counter-desire to live**: ""I wanna see my daughters grow up."" 
    - No mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions. 
    - Focus is on distress and unwanted intrusive thoughts (""voices telling me"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Indirect suicidal ideation is attributed to ""voices,"" not the author’s personal desire. 
    - Author explicitly negates the desire to die (""I wanna see my daughters grow up""). 
    - **Conclusion**: Suicidal thoughts are framed as *unwanted* and externally imposed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations mentioned. 
    - **Conclusion**: Absence of planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - Describes past financial mistakes and current emotional pain but **no past or recent suicidal actions**. 
    - Voices suggest ideation but lack immediacy or action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Suicidal ideation is present but attributed to ""voices"" and explicitly rejected by the author. 
    - Primary themes are distress, helplessness, and a plea for help/solutions. 
    - Meets **Indicator** criteria: expresses distress and unwanted intrusive thoughts *without* personal desire to die. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal intent favors 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses escaping an abusive relationship and expresses hope for future support and emotional connection.  
   - Emotional indicators include distress (""i'm not okay right now"") but also resilience (""i can be okay"").  
   - Explicitly states ""maybe I don't need to die,"" directly negating a desire for death.  
   - No mention of suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - The phrase ""maybe I don't need to die"" explicitly rejects a desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned; instead, the writer actively distances themselves from death.  
   → **No explicit intent; leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.**  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No references to methods, tools, locations, preparations, or timelines.  
   → **Absence confirms no 'Behavior'.**  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on future hopes and current emotional struggle.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions.  
   → **No evidence of 'Attempt'.**  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses distress and acknowledges not being ""okay"" but couples this with hope and self-reassurance.  
   - Explicit rejection of death (""don't need to die"") rules out 'Ideation' (which requires desire to die).  
   - No plan/method ('Behavior') or initiated action ('Attempt').  
   → **Fits 'Indicator': distress without personal suicidal desire.**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions taking 3 Xanax pills and asks about the risk of death. 
   - Explicitly states ""i dont wanna die rn"" and frames the pill-taking as a way to ""be calm"" due to boredom. 
   - References suicidal thoughts as intrusive (""when im bored suicidal thoughts are always there""), not expressing a current desire to act on them. 
   - Declares intent to take pills regardless of advice (""i will do it anyway"") but frames it as curiosity about consequences, not a suicide attempt. 
   - No specific suicide plan, method (beyond the Xanax mention in a non-suicidal context), preparations, or past actions described. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No**: Directly negates desire to die (""i dont wanna die rn""). Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but framed as passive/unwanted (""always there"" during boredom). The pill inquiry is contextualized as seeking calm, not suicide. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**: Mention of pills is exploratory (""can you die...?"") and explicitly non-lethal in intent (""i just wanna be calm""). No plan, tools, locations, or preparations tied to suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes future pill-taking for non-suicidal reasons. No past/current suicidal actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core is **distress** (boredom, intrusive thoughts) and a **non-suicidal self-harm behavior** (taking pills to cope). 
   - Explicit lack of death/suicide desire (""i dont wanna die rn"") and context of pill use rules out *Ideation/Behavior*. 
   - No past/current suicidal action rules out *Attempt*. 
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress, unwanted suicidal thoughts without personal desire to die, and non-suicidal harmful behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense self-loathing (""piece of human garbage,"" ""monster""), guilt over harming a friend, and distress about abandonment fears. 
   - Explicitly asks for advice on concealed self-harm locations (""does anyone know what places on the body can be self harmed without anyone noticing""). 
   - Ends with a conditional suicidal threat: ""if he is dead, i will wait until I can kill myself."" 
   - No explicit mention of past suicidal actions (e.g., no description of an initiated attempt). 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness, guilt, and self-directed anger are prominent. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the phrase ""kill myself"" is explicitly stated, indicating a personal desire to die under specific conditions. 
   - The self-harm inquiry (""places on the body"") implies intent to engage in self-injurious behavior, which is distinct from suicidal intent but shows active harmful planning. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTICATION**: 
   - The self-harm question explicitly seeks a *method* (""places on the body"") for concealed self-injury, indicating active planning/preparation. 
   - The suicidal threat (""wait until I can kill myself"") lacks specific method/timing but pairs with the self-harm planning. 
   - No explicit suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring tools) are mentioned for suicide. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Self-harm planning is current/future-oriented (asking where to self-harm covertly). 
   - Suicidal intent is conditional and future-oriented (""wait until I can kill myself""). 
   - No description of past or recent *initiated* suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."" statements). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal suicidal desire (""kill myself""). 
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal desire is present, but the self-harm inquiry constitutes *preparation/planning for self-injury*. Self-harm (even non-suicidal) with concealed methods falls under preparatory ""Behavior"" per the framework. 
   - **Behavior**: The post includes suicidal desire *and* explicit planning for self-harm (seeking hidden locations), satisfying the definition of planning/preparation. 
   - **Attempt**: Ruled out—no description of past/recent initiated lethal actions. 
   - Key distinction: The self-harm query demonstrates actionable planning, elevating it beyond passive ideation. 

Conclusion: The post shows suicidal desire with preparatory behavior (self-harm planning), fitting 'Behavior'.

196,Im probably going to kill myself soon. I've been feeling a really strong urge to lately and the only people i have in my life dont care. They dont make any effort to keep me around. i just wish i wasn't even born to begin with. life is fucking stupid,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide (""kill myself""), a strong current urge to act on these thoughts, feelings of hopelessness (""wish I wasn't even born""), despair (""life is fucking stupid""), and perceived burdensomeness (""people don't care... don't make effort to keep me around"").
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, gun), locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""soon""), but it is vague and lacks imminence (e.g., no specific time like ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, current desire to die (e.g., ""strong urge to lately,"" ""probably going to kill myself soon""). There is no negation of this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tools, substances, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The reference to ""soon"" is general and not tied to concrete details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""probably going to... soon"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of a prior attempt or interrupted action). It focuses on thoughts and urges, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die with explicit suicidal thoughts, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation'. However, it lacks any mention of a specific plan, method, or preparation, which rules out 'Behavior'. There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The clear suicidal intent distinguishes it from 'Indicator', which is for general distress without personal desire to die or with unwanted thoughts.
   - Final reasoning: Suicidal desire is present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated, so 'Ideation' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""go to the highest floor and plummet to the ground,"" explicitly describing a method (jumping from height).  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt, fear of consequences for others, and fear of surviving with injuries (""crippled instead of a corpse"").  
   - A specific method (""plummet to the ground"") and location (""highest floor"") are stated.  
   - The phrase ""so tempted"" indicates active consideration but no initiation of action.  
   - No past actions are described; the focus is on internal conflict about a hypothetical future act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Plummet to the ground"" implies a lethal fall, and ""crippled instead of a corpse"" confirms intent to die. The desire is personal (""I"") and current (""tempted"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. A method (jumping from height) and location (highest floor) are explicitly mentioned. No preparations (e.g., notes) are described, but the specificity of method qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses temptation about a potential future act (""if only...""). No past or recent initiated action is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/location = **Behavior**.  
   - Ambivalence (guilt/fear) does not negate the suicidal intent or planning.  
   - No concrete action occurred, ruling out ""Attempt."" The method detail distinguishes this from ""Ideation.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent.  
   - Emotional context involves guilt/shame (fear of hurting the boyfriend) and implied burden (""he won’t feel that bad"").  
   - **No specific method, plan, preparation, or timeline** is mentioned.  
   - The phrasing is conditional/hypothetical (""If I deeply hurt..."") but expresses a personal desire tied to suicide.  
   - No reference to past actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrase ""kill myself"" is used.  
   - **Yes**: The statement implies a personal desire for suicide in the hypothetical scenario.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"")—suicide is presented as a consequential action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, tools, location, or preparations** are mentioned.  
   - The focus is on the *reason* (hurting boyfriend) and outcome (his reaction), not logistical planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **hypothetical future scenario**, not a past/current action.  
   - **No initiated or interrupted actions** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions specific method: ""jump"" from a ""hospital parking garage.""  
   - Describes repeated preparatory actions: ""standing on the ledge,"" ""sit there,"" ""sometimes for an hour.""  
   - Explicit desire: ""hoping I'll gain the courage [to jump]"" and expresses distress about lack of intervention.  
   - References a past suicide at the same location but no personal past attempt.  
   - Temporal context: Ongoing behavior (""I go,"" ""last time""), no initiated lethal action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Trying to work up the nerve to jump"" and ""hoping I'll gain the courage [to jump]"" confirm active desire to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/location + preparations (physically going to the ledge) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: Method (""jump"") and preparations (repeatedly positioning on ledge) are clear.  
   - Distinction from Attempt: No description of a past/current initiated lethal act (e.g., no jump started/failed).  
   - ""Trying to work up the nerve"" implies intent but no action beyond preparation.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide attempts: ""The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger"" and ""I have multiple attempts on my life"".  
   - Explicit desire to die: ""my death seems to [be] the ultimate answer"".  
   - Current suicidal planning: ""recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it to look like an accident"".  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is going absolutely shitty""), guilt (""all I caused was problems""), and isolation (""drove everyone away"").  
   - Past actions are concrete (attempts with a method), and current behavior involves active research into methods.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""tried committing suicide,"" ""ways to kill myself,"" and ""my death"" show clear personal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Past method: ""using a phone charger"" (substitute for rope).  
   - Current preparation: Actively ""searching about ways to kill myself"" to stage an accident.  
   - **Plan/preparation is present** in both past and current contexts.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past actions**: Describes concrete, initiated suicide attempts (e.g., using a phone charger).  
   - **Current behavior**: Actively researching methods but no initiated action described.  
   - **Key distinction**: Past attempts meet the 'Attempt' threshold (potentially lethal, self-initiated actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempts (""tried committing suicide,"" ""multiple attempts"") are explicitly described as **initiated actions**, falling under 'Attempt'.  
   - Current suicidal ideation/research would typically be 'Behavior', but **'Attempt' takes precedence** per guidelines when a concrete past action is disclosed.  
   - The post emphasizes *past actions* more than imminent future plans, solidifying 'Attempt' as the primary category.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of betrayal (""faking everything""), hopelessness (""nobody cares about me,"" ""more dead inside""), and exhaustion (""done with everything"").  
   - Key phrases: ""more dead inside,"" ""done with everything,"" ""done being played with,"" ""done trying my best.""  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Emotional language centers on despair but lacks personal suicidal desire.  
   - The phrase ""more dead inside"" is metaphorical (emotional numbness), not literal.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - **No clear desire to die** expressed. Distress focuses on relational pain and futility (""done with everything""), not ending life.

     - Personal desire to die (rules out *Ideation*).  
     - Plan/method/preparation (rules out *Behavior*).  
     - Past/recent suicidal actions (rules out *Attempt*).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""jump off"" and specifically ""jump out of my bedroom window,"" indicating a method (jumping) and a location (bedroom window). 
   - It includes emotional indicators like building courage (""I'm getting more courage"") and anticipation (""Hopefully I can do it soon"").
   - There is a reference to the environment (""trees and mud below""), which suggests assessment of the method, but no explicit preparations like writing a note or acquiring means are described. The temporal context is future-oriented (""soon""), with no mention of past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump off"" in this context implies a self-harm intent associated with ending life.
   - It expresses a desire to act (e.g., ""I think I can jump off,"" ""Hopefully I can do it soon""), with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated. Thus, there is an implied desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (jumping) and location (bedroom window) are mentioned, along with mental preparation (""getting more courage"").
   - This constitutes a plan/method, which aligns with the 'Behavior' category.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""soon""), not past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I did"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal suicidal desire (leaning away from 'Indicator') and includes a specific method/location, which moves it beyond 'Ideation' (desire without plan). As no past action is described, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit due to the presence of a plan/method.

   - Mentions depression, family mental illness history, reluctance to seek therapy, and feeling like a burden.
   - Key phrase: ""sometimes depression hits really hard and next thing I know I'm writing suicide notes."" 
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""waste their time""), anhedonia (""low energy"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - ""Writing suicide notes"" is a preparatory behavior. However, this is described as a passive consequence of depression (""next thing I know"") without linkage to a current plan, method, or imminent action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - References writing suicide notes as a past/recurring behavior during severe depressive episodes. No description of a specific initiated lethal action (e.g., attempting overdose). Notes are preparatory, not an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - **No explicit current desire to die** → leans away from Ideation/Behavior.
   - **Preparation (notes) exists but lacks active intent or plan** → not standalone Behavior.
   - Primary focus: Distress about depression/relationships. Suicide notes are mentioned as an unwanted symptom, aligning with **Indicator** (unwanted thoughts/preparations without genuine current desire to act).

No one cares not even me if i get the things i sought and need its okay but if i dont i suddenly get all depressed there are people suffering from medical depression on this sub and you think your petty problems are enough to warrant sympathy from suicide watchers idk maybe i just need attention yes its all a ruse for attention. People dying is funny hope that asshole dies hope i die maybe then ill get a good chuckle fuck me fuck da world",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense emotional distress, including phrases like ""suffering mentally,"" ""all depressed,"" and hopelessness (e.g., ""fuck me fuck da world""). It explicitly mentions death/dying with ""hope that asshole dies hope i die"" and ""People dying is funny,"" indicating a personal desire for death. However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, guns), plans (e.g., when or how), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions. The writer also questions their own motives, suggesting it might be ""a ruse for attention,"" but this does not clearly negate the expressed desire to die. No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post includes explicit personal expressions of a desire to die, such as ""hope i die."" This is stated in a context of despair, even with sarcastic or attention-seeking undertones. There is no explicit statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not desire to act on them (e.g., phrases like ""I don't want to die"" are absent). The attention comment adds ambiguity but does not override the direct expression of a wish for death.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, saying goodbye) are mentioned. The references to death are vague and lack concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and desires but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an initiated attempt like taking pills). It focuses on present emotional state without indicating imminent action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""hope i die"") and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator,' which requires no personal desire or unwanted thoughts. The lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior.' No described past or recent suicidal actions rules out 'Attempt.' Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the personal expression of suicidal desire without concrete plans or actions. The attention-seeking aspect does not downgrade it to 'Indicator' because the desire is still explicitly stated.

205,Ah. Just cut to deep fuck,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post ""Ah. Just cut to deep fuck"" appears to contain a possible typo (e.g., ""cut to deep"" likely means ""cut too deep""). ""Cut"" suggests self-injury, which may or may not be related to suicide. However, there are no explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm in a suicidal context (e.g., no phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""end it""). Emotional indicators include frustration or distress (""Ah,"" ""fuck""), but no clear expressions of hopelessness, despair, anhedonia, or being a burden. No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes) are mentioned. The phrase ""just cut"" implies a recent action, but it is not described as part of a suicidal act. There is no stated desire to die or any reference to unwanted suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. No expression of a clear desire to die or not be alive (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no indication of whether such thoughts are unwanted or not. Therefore, this leans strongly toward 'Indicator' as there is no personal expression of suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The word ""cut"" could imply a method (e.g., cutting as self-harm), but it is not specified in a suicidal context. No details about tools, locations, or preparations are provided. Without any indication that this is part of a suicidal plan, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. Self-harm alone, without suicidal intent, is insufficient for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a recent action (""just cut""), but it is vague and lacks context about lethality or intent. There is no description of a concrete, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., no mention of intending to die or that the cutting was a suicide attempt). Therefore, it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress and possible self-injury but lacks any explicit desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or preparation. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which includes general distress or self-harm without clear suicidal intent. Since there is ambiguity about suicidal desire (and no evidence of it), 'Indicator' is the appropriate choice over 'Ideation'. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' do not apply due to the absence of suicidal elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense anger and frustration towards others who post generic supportive comments (e.g., ""don't do it!""). The author criticizes these comments as insincere and attention-seeking. Key elements include:
   - **Emotional indicators**: Anger, resentment, and cynicism about others' motives.
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.
   - **No references** to past actions or suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).
   - **No temporal markers** suggesting imminent risk (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.
   - The author focuses on criticizing others' behavior, **not** expressing personal suicidal ideation or a wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparatory actions.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - **No descriptions** of past/current suicidal actions or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post shows **distress and cynicism** but lacks a personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions. 
   - The anger is directed externally (at others' behavior), not internally (e.g., self-hatred or hopelessness). 
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress without explicit suicidal desire, ideation, or behavior from the author.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""kinda just wanna die but dont at the same time"" – expresses ambivalence about death/suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: hopelessness (""struggle to get up,"" ""find everything boring""), isolation (""friends left,"" ""bullied,"" stopped school), worthlessness (""bad grades"").  
   - **No mention** of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  
   - Desire is explicitly conflicted: ""wanna die but dont at the same time.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""wanna die"" but **immediately negates it** (""but dont at the same time""). The primary sentiment is distress about conflicted feelings, not a clear desire to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No indication** of a plan, method, tools, location, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggles but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no attempt, interruption, or preparatory act).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Ambivalent desire (""wanna die but dont"") and lack of plan/method align with **Indicator**.  
   - Explicit suicidal thought is present but framed as *unwanted* and lacks conviction or intent to act.  
   - Rules out Ideation (requires clear desire to die without ambivalence) and higher categories (no plan/behavior/attempt).

208,"Should I share my thoughts with a long distance friend. I understand this is probably a very basic thing to ask, and I feel guilty for asking when I know 99% of people have it way worse than me. Writing this while my head is at it's clearest. I've been having suicidal thoughts for a while now, and as my anxiety and depression seems to be getting worse almost every day, they've increased to where I've been thinking about it most of the time for the past few months. I know people such as a few friends and my dad would not take it the best right away, some of them have lost enough people already, and despite wishing I've never met them because I fear I only hurt, I know it would have a really bad impact. But every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying. I don't have many strong and reliable methods at my finger tips but I know how impulsive and sporadic I can get at my worst. I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that. There's not even anything he can do, I don't know how that'd change anything. But for some reason I fell like if I keep getting worse he has to know, at the very least as a warning.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" worsening anxiety/depression, and daily feelings of wanting to ""justify dying.""  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt, hopelessness (""I fear I only hurt""), self-destructive tendencies, and feeling like a burden.  
   - The author references ""partially planning to die"" but provides **no specific method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - Mentions impulsivity and having ""few strong and reliable methods"" but no concrete plans or imminent actions (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - No past actions (e.g., attempts) are described—only persistent thoughts and hypothetical concerns.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""want to justify dying,"" and ""partially planning to die."" The desire to die is personal and current (""every single day I feel terrible and want to justify dying"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Though ""planning to die"" is mentioned, it is qualified as ""partial"" and lacks specifics (method, tools, timeline, or preparations). The author explicitly states they lack ""reliable methods"" and only references impulsivity as a risk.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on ongoing thoughts (""thinking about it most of the time for the past few months"") and potential future disclosure. **No description of past/current initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried X"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit personal desire to die (""want to justify dying"") rules out Indicator.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No specific plan/method/preparation is stated (only vague ""partially planning""), so it does not meet the threshold for Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past/recent concrete suicidal actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: The core content expresses a persistent desire to die with suicidal thoughts but lacks actionable plans or methods. Fits **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""no reason to keep going""), despair (""my life has always been shit""), and self-loathing (""ugly useless stupid girl""). 
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""better off dead,"" ""end it,"" and ""hang myself."" 
   - A specific plan/method is detailed: ""drive out into the mountains... hike... find a nice little spot to hang myself."" 
   - No past actions (e.g., prior attempts) are described—only future intentions. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""better off dead,"" ""end it,"" and ""hang myself."" The desire is personal and current (""now I really don’t care anymore""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **Yes**: A specific method (hanging) and location (mountains, away from paths) are outlined. The act is planned but not yet initiated. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes future intent (""I could just drive out..."") with no mention of past/ongoing actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (ruling out *Indicator*). 
   - A specific method/location is provided (ruling out *Ideation*). 
   - No initiated lethal action is described (ruling out *Attempt*).

210,I want to be dead. I don't enjoy anything. I am lonely. I am seeking therapy and taking antidepressants. I am not healing. It is terrible. I don't want to live anymore.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit expressions of a desire to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"") and emotional indicators of hopelessness (e.g., ""I don't enjoy anything,"" ""I am not healing,"" ""It is terrible""). It also mentions coping mechanisms (""seeking therapy and taking antidepressants""), but no specific suicide plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or imminent timing). There are no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states a desire to die with phrases like ""I want to be dead"" and ""I don't want to live anymore,"" which indicate a personal and current suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author is resisting them (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. The references to therapy and antidepressants are help-seeking behaviors, not suicidal preparations.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no mention of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no initiated events like ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to be dead,"" ""I don't want to live anymore"") qualifies this for 'Ideation' as it involves personal suicidal thoughts without any plan, method, or preparation. The emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness) supports this but does not override the clear suicidal intent. Since there is no plan/method, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. No past actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. The absence of any negation of suicidal desire (e.g., ""I don't actually want to die"") means it does not fit 'Indicator'.

   - Emotional indicators: Frustration (""i wish i wasn't like this""), effort to suppress thoughts.  
   - Specific method referenced: ""eye drops in his beverages"" as a suicide method idea.  
   - **Crucially**, the writer states: ""I try to suppress my suicidal thoughts as much as I can because I know deep down that I really don’t want to have to do that."" This explicitly negates a genuine desire to act.  
   - No plan, preparation, or imminent timeline described. The method is framed passively (""gave me an idea""), not as an active plan.  
   - No past actions initiated (e.g., no attempt described).

   - Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicitly mentioned.

   - A method (eye drops) is mentioned, but only as an abstract ""idea"" triggered by external content.  
   - No evidence of planning, preparation, or intent to use the method. The phrasing (""gave me an idea"") is passive and hypothetical.

   - The method mention lacks planning/preparation context and is framed as an unwanted intrusive thought.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: Distress about unwanted suicidal ideation without personal desire to die or act. The method reference is incidental to the core expression of resisting unwanted thoughts.

   - No references to suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Instead, the writer emphasizes enduring pain (""I am hanging on by threads"") and reasons to stay (""the reason I stay now is that I try to find worth in the present"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated; distress focuses on loneliness, trauma, and emotional pain.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Passive statements about being ""gone"" or a ""fading memory"" suggest hopelessness but **not an active desire to die**. The writer explicitly states they stay to ""find worth,"" countering suicidal intent.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit desire to die; leans toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No mention** of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines.  
   - Focus remains on emotional suffering, not actionable plans.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **past trauma** (abuse) and **current distress**, but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""tried to"" statements).  
   - References to enduring pain (""hanging on by threads"") and seeking therapy indicate coping, not initiation of self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Distress without suicidal desire**: Expressions of hopelessness and worthlessness are severe but lack personal suicidal intent.  
   - **Passive vs. active ideation**: Wishing the world wouldn’t miss them is passive and abstract, not a declaration of self-harm.  
   - **Absence of plan/action**: No elements of 'Behavior' (plan/method) or 'Attempt' (past action).  
   - **Key phrases**: ""I wish I wasn’t alone"" (loneliness, not death wish) and ""the reason I stay"" (active coping) support 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ambiguity resolution**: Where suicidal desire is unclear (e.g., ""if I were gone""), rules prioritize 'Indicator'.

I can tell you who to ask and they'll assure you",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""want to die,"" ""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm done with life""), self-perceived burden (""all I cause is pain"").
   - Specific plans/methods: Two methods detailed (slitting wrists in a broken car, hanging from a tree), preparations implied (choosing location ""for my parents to see""), and a timeframe (""Tuesday"").
   - No past actions described; focuses on future intent.
   - Stated desire is unequivocal (""make me want to die,"" ""I'm either going to..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes (""want to die,"" ""slit my wrist,"" ""hang myself""). No negation of desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - Yes. Specific methods (slitting wrists, hanging), tools implied (blade/rope), locations (car, tree), and temporal preparation (""Tuesday""). Intent to enact is explicit.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes future intent (""Tuesday, I'm going to...""). No past/initiated lethal actions mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - Not 'Attempt' (no initiated action), not 'Ideation' (plan exists), not 'Indicator' (desire is explicit and active).

217,"Having a lot of suicidal thoughts but I dont think im depressed. Throwaway because people I know, know my main acc. Turned 17 in Jan. Don't know how to describe exactly how I'm feeling cause it doesn't make much sense (and English is also my 4th language), but I will try my best. I don't think I am depressed. I have many friends, people I can rely on, people that rely on me, support from family, hobbies, I look forward to the next day, I am motivated however I often feel that it would be better if I was dead. It just seems so much better. Why do I struggle and work towards my goals if it wont lead to anything in the ultimate end? Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""having a lot of suicidal thoughts"" and repeatedly expresses a desire for death (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead,"" ""Eternal sleep? Sign me up please"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (questioning life's purpose), emptiness, and guilt, but also notes positive factors (support system, motivation).  
   - **No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned. The references to death are abstract/comparative (e.g., ""death is just like sleep"").  
   - The author explicitly states barriers to acting on thoughts (e.g., suicide being ""selfish,"" concern for dog, loved ones, and friends), indicating these thoughts are **unwanted or resisted**.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described (e.g., the robbery incident is a hypothetical reaction, not a suicide attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated.  
   - **Yes**, a desire to die is expressed (e.g., ""it would be better if I was dead"").  
   - **Crucially, the writer explicitly negates acting on these thoughts** due to external obligations/guilt (e.g., ""suicide is selfish,"" concerns about dog/friends). This frames the suicidal thoughts as **distressing but unwanted**, leaning toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations** are mentioned. Death is discussed philosophically (""eternal sleep""), not as a concrete plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts**, not past/future actions. The robbery anecdote is unrelated to self-harm.  
   - **No initiated suicidal actions** (past or recent) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **explicit suicidal thoughts and desire to die**, but these are **counterbalanced by clear reasons against acting** (guilt, responsibility), framing the thoughts as distressing intrusions rather than active intent.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is present, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/recent suicidal actions** described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
   - The **combination of explicit suicidal thoughts with unambiguous disavowal of action** aligns best with 'Indicator' (per definition: ""suicidal thoughts if explicitly stated as unwanted and not representing a current personal desire to die"").  
   - *Note*: While desire is expressed, the overwhelming emphasis on resistance and lack of actionable intent tips this to 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' (per rule: ""If in doubt due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator"").

218,"Hotline where they can't track me or call the police to come to me?. Last time I called a hotline just to have someone to talk to (didn't have a method or anything), I ended up having the cops called on me and they came to my dorm room and I got stuck in a psych ward for 3 days. It made me 10x more suicidal to be there. My question is, is there a hotline I can call or text where they won't call anyone on me? I'm just. worried about them being able to get my location somehow. Maybe I'm being irrational but I'm paranoid after what happened last time",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The user describes a past negative experience with a hotline where they sought support (without a suicide method/plan) but faced police intervention and hospitalization.  
   - They explicitly state this experience made them ""10x more suicidal"" but frame this as a *past reaction*.  
   - The post focuses on seeking a *safe way to access support* (a hotline that won’t track/call police) due to fear/paranoia from their prior experience.  
   - No mention of current suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plans, methods, preparations, or past/current suicidal actions. The phrase ""more suicidal"" references a past emotional state, not current intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. While the user mentions becoming ""more suicidal"" in the past, this is contextualized as a consequence of trauma, not a current desire to die. The post lacks phrases like ""I want to die"" or direct expressions of active suicidal intent. The focus is distress about accessing help, not personal suicidal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. There is no reference to a suicide plan, method, tools, location, or preparations (past or present). The user explicitly states they previously called ""just to talk"" without a method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The only past action described is *calling a hotline for support*, not a suicidal act. The hospitalization was involuntary (an external response), not a self-initiated suicide attempt. No initiated suicidal actions (past or present) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is **distress about barriers to mental health support** (fear of intervention) and trauma from past institutionalization.  
   - The phrase ""made me 10x more suicidal"" reflects a past emotional state, but the post lacks a *current, personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior*.  
   - Since there is no explicit suicidal intent, plan, method, or action by the author, this aligns with **Indicator** (distress about mental health/suicide-related experiences without current personal suicidal desire or intent).

219,This is not right. I dont want to live anymore. I just want be by myself.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post states ""I dont want to live anymore,"" which directly expresses a desire not to be alive. It also includes ""This is not right,"" indicating distress, and ""I just want be by myself,"" suggesting isolation or withdrawal.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: While it doesn't use explicit terms like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" ""don't want to live anymore"" is a clear expression of a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators: The language conveys hopelessness and despair (e.g., ""not right,"" ""don't want to live"").
   - Plans/methods/preparations: No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - Past actions: No reference to any past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - Imminence: No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") suggesting immediacy.
   - Stated desire: The phrase ""I dont want to live anymore"" expresses a genuine personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""I dont want to live anymore"" is a direct and personal expression of a desire to not be alive, equivalent to a wish to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don't want to"") indicating the thoughts are unwanted. Thus, this is not 'Indicator' and points to suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The desire to ""be by myself"" implies isolation but does not constitute a suicidal plan or preparation. Without any explicit planning element, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and desires (""I dont want to live"") with no reference to past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I dont want to live anymore""), which aligns with 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or preparation). It is not 'Indicator' because the desire is explicit and not framed as unwanted thoughts. It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan/method, and not 'Attempt' as no past or recent action is described.
   - Following the rules: The suicide risk is solely for the author; there is no ambiguity about desire (so 'Indicator' is ruled out); and no plan/method means 'Behavior' is not applicable. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

AND YOU SAYING THAT DOESNT HELP AT ALL AND MAKES ME HATE YOU BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY DONT KNOW HOW I FEEL IF YOU SAY THAT. Everything I do that has something to do with my feelings I get called out for 'attention seeking.'. They don't care. They won't believe it until I die. Then they'll say 'oh why didn't he ask for help' BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT YOU SICK PIECE OF GARBAGE. Sorry for the rage it just really angers me when someone says that bullshit,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense anger and frustration towards people who dismiss expressions of distress as ""attention-seeking,"" particularly in the context of suicidal feelings. The author references being accused of not being genuinely suicidal and defends themselves by stating they are ""trying to hold on"" and ""still need help."" They mention past experiences of seeking help being neglected, with hypothetical statements about death (e.g., ""They won't believe it until I die""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., feeling unheard and neglected) and despair, but the primary focus is on the rage against invalidating comments.
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Suicide is discussed indirectly through the quoted statement (""If you are actually suicidal... you would've told no one and just ended it silently"") and in the author's response, but it is not a personal expression of the author's own desire. Phrases like ""until I die"" are hypothetical and refer to others' potential reactions, not the author's intent.
   - Specific plans, methods, or preparations: None are mentioned. The post does not indicate any plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.
   - References to past actions: The author mentions having asked for help (""BC I DID AND U NEGLECTED IT""), but this refers to seeking support, not a suicidal act. No description of initiating or attempting suicide.
   - Imminence: No time frames (e.g., ""tonight"") or immediate intentions are stated.
   - Stated desire: The author emphasizes trying to ""hold on"" and needing help, which suggests distress and a desire for support, not a wish to die. Suicidal thoughts are contextualized as unwanted accusations from others, not personally endorsed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Does the post explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar? No. Suicide is referenced indirectly via the quoted statement, but the author does not personally use direct phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself.""
   - Does it express a clear personal desire to die? No. The author states, ""IM TRYING TO FUCKING HOLD ON"" and ""I STILL NEED HELP,"" indicating a struggle to cope and a plea for assistance, not an endorsement of suicidal thoughts.
   - If suicidal thoughts are mentioned, are they unwanted? The author does not explicitly state they have suicidal thoughts; instead, they refute the idea that expressing feelings is ""attention-seeking."" The distress is about being misunderstood, not about unwanted suicidal ideation. This leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is distress without personal suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are present.
   - Since there is no evidence of a plan or method, and suicidal desire is not explicitly expressed, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past experiences of seeking help and ongoing emotional struggles, but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described. References to death are hypothetical (""until I die"") and not based on concrete actions by the author.
   - No initiated suicidal acts are mentioned, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows general distress, anger, and hopelessness related to being invalidated and neglected when seeking help, but it lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. Suicidal themes are discussed abstractly in response to others' comments, not as the author's own experience. Phrases like ""trying to hold on"" and ""need help"" reinforce a desire for support over a wish to die.
   - Ambiguity exists because the author engages with suicidal topics, but the explicit personal desire is absent. Per the rules, when in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.
   - No plan/method or preparation is present, so it cannot be 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

Conclusion: The post fits 'Indicator' as it expresses distress and discusses suicide abstractly without a personal desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense loneliness, hopelessness (""I have no more strenght""), and despair (""it huts so much"").  
   - Explicitly states suicidal desire: ""I feel like killing my self every day.""  
   - Mentions specific **preparations**: ""Everythings ready, suicide note, bills, testament. it's all done.""  
   - Refers to a potential imminent action: ""this might be my final good bye.""  
   - No description of a past or recent *initiated* suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""killing my self"" and frames it as a current, persistent feeling (""every day""). No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly notes completed preparations (""suicide note, bills, testament"") and emphasizes ""it's all done."" Though no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned, preparations qualify as ""behavior.""  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current/future intention** (""this might be my final good bye"") and references past disappointments, but **no past/initiated suicidal action** is described (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (ruling out *Indicator*).  
   - Preparations are explicitly mentioned (ruling out *Ideation*).  
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (ruling out *Attempt*).  
   - **Behavior** fits: Explicit desire + concrete preparations (completed note, arrangements).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""kms"" (kill myself) repeated, ""I'm going to kill myself very soon,"" ""I can't get these thoughts out of my head.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I'm not ok,"" ""I don't know what to do""), isolation (""I can't talk to anyone""), shame/embarrassment about seeking help.  
   - Stated desire: Clear personal wish to die (""I finally accepted the fact that I'm going to kill myself very soon"").  
   - Self-harm: ""I can't stop cutting"" (contextual but noted).  
   - Plan/Method: No specific method, tools, location, or preparations described (e.g., ""kms"" is vague; no pills, weapons, or notes mentioned).  
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""very soon,"" ""just not yet though I can't leave my dog""). No past or recent initiated lethal actions described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal intent is explicit, no concrete plan, method (e.g., overdose, hanging), or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. ""Kms"" and ""soon"" are nonspecific.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""soon"") but **no past or recent initiated lethal action**. Cutting is self-harm but not a suicide attempt.

Having 4 people talk me down at the same time, really makes me wanna ruin their lives by killing myself even more. I told them to stop talking to me and leave me alone but they wouldn't. So apparently they found one of my suicide notes I threw away in the trash. They told me that if I do it, it would be a life sentence of misery for them. That's selfish in its own right, I shouldn't have to stay alive for them because they will be eternally scarred. I don't care. What happened afterward is a blur of arguments that is hard to put into chronological order. A few statements made me really wish I could shoot myself on the spot. Somebody told me to grow up, he also told me something like ""what gets on my nerves is that you won't talk to us but you'll tell a therapist everything"". My parent kept pitching ideas of me going into the military to find a purpose in life, what a fucking tool, he also kept pointing out that I wouldn't look anybody in the eyes, I have problems with eye contact with people.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanna kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" ""shoot myself,"" and references to a suicide note.
   - Emotional indicators: Anger (""they deserve to live with the burden""), hopelessness (""I don't care""), and feeling trapped (""shouldn't have to stay alive for them"").
   - Preparations: Confirms writing a suicide note (""they found one of my suicide notes I threw away"").
   - Methods: Specifically mentions ""shoot myself"" as a desired action.
   - Imminence: No explicit timeframe (e.g., ""tonight""), but intense current distress is evident.
   - Desire: Strong personal desire to die is expressed (""wanna kill myself,"" ""wish I could shoot myself"") without stating these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes. Direct phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""shoot myself."" The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I don’t care"" about family suffering).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes. A specific method (""shoot myself"") is mentioned. Preparations are confirmed via the suicide note (""found one of my suicide notes"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current ideation and anger, alongside past preparations (writing/throwing away the note). No *initiated* lethal action (e.g., attempting to shoot) is described—only desires and preparatory steps.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die (suicide/death intent) rules out 'Indicator'.
   - Mention of a specific method (""shoot myself"") and preparation (suicide note) exceeds 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - No description of a past or recent *initiated* lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to shoot myself"")—only wishes and preparatory behavior. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Fits 'Behavior': Suicidal desire + specific method/preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""OD"" (overdose) as a method of suicide, with specific substances listed: venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolpidem (zolfresh), and propranolol (inderal). It includes a plan to take all of them at once (""popping all of them at once"") and expresses a sense of urgency with ""today.""
   - Emotional indicators are present: ""I can't feel anything right now"" (numbness/despair) and ""it's all I can think about"" (preoccupation with suicide). The author references a history of suicidal thoughts (""I've been thinking about suicide for a while now"").
   - There is no description of past actions initiated (e.g., no mention of a previous overdose attempt). The focus is on current/future intentions.
   - The author's desire to die is implied through the plan to overdose and ""hope for the best,"" but there is no explicit statement of not wanting these thoughts or actions (e.g., no negation like ""I don't want to die"").

   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and uses ""OD"" (overdose) as a direct reference to self-harm with lethal intent.
   - The phrase ""think I'm going to OD today"" and ""hope for the best"" indicate a current, personal desire for death, not merely unwanted thoughts. There is no indication that the thoughts are rejected.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is clearly stated: overdose using named medications (venlafaxine, quetiapine, zolpidem, propranolol). The plan includes taking all pills at once.
   - Preparation is implied through possession of a ""month's prescription,"" indicating access to means. The temporal element ""today"" adds imminence.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""going to OD today"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. References to ""thinking about suicide"" are ideation-based, not descriptions of concrete past behaviors (e.g., no ""I tried but..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content includes explicit suicidal desire and a specific plan/method (overdose with listed drugs), moving it beyond general distress (Indicator) or desire without a plan (Ideation).
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no attempt was made), so Attempt does not apply.
   - With a clear plan and method, the classification is Behavior, as per the rule: ""mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken.""

225,"Sorry. I've got nothing left. I'm completely used up. Sorry to anyone I've ever hurt and thank you to those who brought any light into my life. The end is the only thing that feels right now. Love you Mom, Dad, Sarek, and Jayson. I'm sorry I wasn't a better person.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses feelings of being depleted (""I've got nothing left,"" ""I'm completely used up"") and hopelessness. It includes apologies and thanks, which resemble a farewell message. The phrase ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" strongly implies a desire for death or suicide, though it is not explicit. There are no mentions of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note beyond this post, acquiring means), or time frames (e.g., ""tonight""). No past suicidal actions are described. The emotional tone is one of despair and finality, with the author expressing a genuine wish for ""the end,"" suggesting a desire to die rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. However, ""The end is the only thing that feels right now"" expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive, in the context of despair. The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or negate the desire; instead, it is presented as feeling ""right,"" indicating a genuine wish to die. Thus, this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) is mentioned or implied. The apologies and thanks could be interpreted as a form of goodbye, but this is not explicit preparation (e.g., ""writing a suicide note"" is not stated). Without any clear plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and intentions (e.g., ""feels right now""), but no past or recent suicidal actions are mentioned. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., taking pills), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (""The end is the only thing that feels right now""), which is explicit enough for 'Ideation'. However, there is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'. The lack of explicit suicide terminology or unwanted thoughts distinguishes this from 'Indicator', and the absence of past actions rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the suicidal desire without concrete plans.

226,"It's late in the evening and I feel so bad. Nothing particular happened today but I feel terrible. Like, terrible teribble. I was already suicidal and depressed but this is something different. My mind is going crazy and all I want to do is shut every thought down by cutting my god damn throat. I feel incredibly overwhelmed and don't know what to do. Fuck, I can't even cry.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""already suicidal and depressed"" and current intense distress (""feel terrible,"" ""mind is going crazy,"" ""incredibly overwhelmed"").  
   - Explicitly states a desire to act: ""shut every thought down by **cutting my god damn throat**"" – this is a direct reference to a specific lethal method (throat-cutting).  
   - No indication of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools) or past actions taken.  
   - Expresses current emotional crisis but no explicit negation of suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to do this"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""I was already suicidal"" (personal history) + ""cutting my god damn throat"" (explicit method tied to suicidal intent).  
   - Desire to die is strongly implied by the violent imagery.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method is clearly stated**: ""cutting my god damn throat."" This is a lethal method directly linked to the desire to end thoughts/life.  
   - No mention of preparations (e.g., ""I have a knife"") or past actions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a *current urge* (""all I want to do"") but **no indication of initiated action** (past or present).  
   - Focus is on immediate desire with a method, not a completed/interrupted act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** + **specific method** (throat-cutting) = **Behavior**.  
   - Though no preparations are described, the explicit naming of a lethal method satisfies the criteria for 'Behavior'.  
   - Not 'Attempt' because no action was initiated. Not 'Ideation' due to method specificity. Not 'Indicator' due to clear personal desire to act.

227,"Quote about suicide. I recently stumbled upon this quote that said something along the lines of ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doenst matter"" much more beautifully phrased thought. Anyone know more about it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses a quote about suicide: ""if you want to kill yourself you might as well keep going cause it doesn't matter."" The user describes it as ""beautifully phrased"" and asks if anyone knows more about it.
   - There is a mention of suicide (""kill yourself"") but it is part of a quoted phrase, not a personal expression from the user.
   - No emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair from the user themselves; they are sharing the quote neutrally or appreciatively.
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the user.
   - No imminence or temporal context indicating immediate risk; the focus is on the quote.
   - The user does not express a personal desire to die; instead, they frame the quote as a positive or thoughtful message about continuing to live.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The quote contains explicit phrases like ""kill yourself,"" but this is not the user's own statement. The user is recounting the quote, not expressing personal suicidal intent.
   - The user does not state a personal desire to die or not be alive (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die"" from the user).
   - The suicidal thought is part of the quote and not attributed to the user, so there is no indication that the user has unwanted suicidal thoughts or desires. This leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment is about sharing external content, not personal distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned by the user.
   - The quote itself does not include a plan or method; it is abstract advice.
   - Since there is no personal plan or preparation from the user, this does not support 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes stumbling upon a quote recently, but this is not a suicidal action.
   - No description of past or recent self-initiated, potentially lethal actions by the user (e.g., no mention of attempts).
   - The content is informational (asking about the quote), not action-oriented.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent from the author. The suicide reference is abstract and part of a shared quote.
   - This fits 'Indicator' because it discusses suicide indirectly without the user expressing personal suicidal thoughts, desire, plan, or action. The user's tone is curious or appreciative of the quote's message, not indicative of personal risk.
   - Not 'Ideation' because there is no personal desire to die expressed. Not 'Behavior' because there is no plan or method. Not 'Attempt' because there is no described action.
   - Following the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" Here, there is no personal desire, so 'Indicator' is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes expressions of hopelessness (""my life will never get better""), despair (""i'm not happy anymore""), and a recurring desire to die (""i always end up wanting to die""). 
   - It explicitly mentions a current desire to not be alive: ""i want to leave earth"" and ""now i'm ready to join my dog"" (implying a wish to be with a deceased pet, suggesting death as an escape).
   - There is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The phrase ""ready to join my dog"" is metaphorical and lacks concrete planning details.
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts initiated but stopped). The user describes ongoing thoughts and feelings, not behaviors.
   - Imminence is not indicated (e.g., no words like ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the tone is more resigned and chronic.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, not distress about unwanted thoughts. Phrases like ""i've accepted that"" and ""i'm ready"" show acceptance of suicidal ideation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post directly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""i want to leave earth"" and ""i always end up wanting to die."" This is a personal, current expression of suicidal intent, not abstract or unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means) is mentioned. ""Ready to join my dog"" is vague and does not imply a concrete plan. Without any explicit planning elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post focuses on past and ongoing feelings (e.g., ""never been truly happy since i was young,"" ""endless loop"") but does not describe any initiated suicidal actions. The phrase ""i always end up wanting to die"" refers to recurring ideation, not an attempt. There is no indication of a recent or past concrete action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The content shows explicit suicidal desire, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire to die or only unwanted thoughts).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, this aligns with 'Ideation': the author expresses a personal desire to die and suicidal thoughts, but without specifics on how or when it would be carried out.

229,"My grandpa passed away tonight. I had previously made up my mind. I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit. Now, I know I can't do that. My mom is already doing awful after losing her father, and I couldn't add the loss of a child to that within the same week. It was his time to go. He's been in hospice, and in very bad health for a long time. In a way, his passing has saved my life for the time being. Nothing has changed for me, but I somehow gained a sort of appreciation for my life. I haven't had anyone that close to me die before, and seeing firsthand how it affects people really puts everything into perspective. I don't ever want to make my mother cry the way I saw her cry when she heard he had passed.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions a past intention: ""I was going to kill myself before Christmas hit."" This indicates a clear desire to die and a specific timeframe (""before Christmas"").  
   - The writer states they *cannot* act on this intention now due to their mother's grief (""I know I can't do that""), expressing a current unwillingness to proceed.  
   - There are no mentions of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, or acquired means).  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). The focus is solely on a *previous plan* that was not acted upon.  
   - Emotional themes include guilt (""I couldn’t add the loss of a child""), perspective gained (""seeing firsthand how it affects people""), and a shift toward self-preservation (""gained appreciation for my life"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""kill myself"" is a direct, explicit statement of suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: The desire to die is clear in ""I was going to kill myself.""  
   - **However**, the writer explicitly negates this desire *in the present*: ""I know I can't do that"" and ""I don’t ever want to make my mother cry."" This frames the suicidal thought as unwanted and not reflective of current intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A timeframe (""before Christmas"") implies planning but **no specific method, tool, location, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no ""pills,"" ""gun,"" or ""note"").  
   - Without concrete details, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal ideation and plan are framed as **past intentions** (""had previously made up my mind,"" ""was going to"").  
   - **No action was initiated**: There is no description of an attempt (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took""). The plan was halted by the writer’s decision, not interrupted mid-action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit suicidal desire (""kill myself"") and plan (""before Christmas"") lean toward 'Ideation' or 'Behavior'. However, the absence of a method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - Critically, the writer **explicitly rejects** the past suicidal intent as unwanted *now* and expresses a current desire to avoid causing pain. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes references to suicidal thoughts when they are framed as distressing and not representing a *current* desire to die.  
   - Rule reminder: ""If suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly stated as unwanted... lean towards 'Indicator'.""

Me and my mom fight alot and she says that I don't help her around the house when I'm the only one that does help her. My brother and my dad don't do shit. When i bring this up they say that it's because my dad brings home the money, and my brother doesn't need to do anything because he's a boy. This get me so mad because I do help my mom, but both my brother and dad call me lazy and say that I dont. When we fight I always think about suicide. I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy. They said that I need to do my own laundry, I need to cook my own food &amp; that i need to do everything. Am i being dramatic about this? since thats what triggers me to actually want to commit suicide? Sometimes i feel like thats an excuse to do it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""serious thoughts about suicide for days"" and researching ""easy painless ways to kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Anger, frustration, feeling unappreciated, self-doubt (""faking it""), and triggers (family conflicts).  
   - No explicit plan/method details (e.g., specific tools, locations, or timing like ""tonight"").  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means) or past actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  
   - Desires to die are framed as reactive to triggers but lack immediacy. Self-doubt questions intent (""doing it for attention"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""thoughts about suicide"" and ""kill myself.""  
   - **But**: Questions genuine desire (""feel like I’m doing it for attention""), leaning toward distress over active intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Mentions ""research for easy painless ways,"" but no specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are described.  
   - Research alone implies consideration but not a concrete plan (per rules: ""unsure → Ideation"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Thoughts occurred in February (past) and recur when triggered. No initiated actions (e.g., ""I took pills"") described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts/desire exist (""kill myself""), but no plan/method/preparation is specified.  
   - Research is passive (information-gathering), not actionable preparation.  
   - Self-doubt (""faking it"") suggests ambivalence, but explicit personal desire places it above *Indicator*.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits **Ideation** (desire + thoughts, no plan/preparation).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and philosophical musings about an existence beyond death (""something better on the other side... no human Emotions... Just a being"").  
   - It advocates for normalizing ""Death and suicide"" but frames this as a societal/cultural stance (""need to be normalized""), not a personal expression of intent.  
   - **No explicit personal desire to die**, specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No**: The author does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""I will kill myself,"" or similar personal declarations. References to suicide are abstract/generalized (""suicide need to be normalized"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: No specific method, tools, locations, or preparatory actions (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No**: The post discusses abstract concepts and societal views. It describes no past/current personal suicidal actions or attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The core sentiment is hopelessness (""Life is useless"") and advocacy for normalizing death/suicide, but **without personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Mentions of suicide are detached (focused on societal acceptance) rather than reflecting the author’s current intent.  
   - This aligns with **Indicator**: General distress, abstract discussion of suicide/death, and **no explicit personal desire to die**.

232,Ain't the thought of death just beautiful?. To never feel pain anymore. Never deal with the hassle. To be nothing in a black sea of infinity. To let go after holding on so tight. Isn't it just beautiful?,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post discusses the concept of death abstractly, romanticizing it as an escape from pain and life's burdens (""never feel pain anymore,"" ""never deal with the hassle,"" ""to be nothing""). It uses metaphorical language (""black sea of infinity,"" ""let go after holding on so tight"") and frames death as ""beautiful."" There are **no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations**. The tone conveys hopelessness and despair but focuses on philosophical musings about death, not personal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used.  
   - The post expresses abstract attraction to death but **does not state a personal desire to die** (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I weren’t here""). The phrasing (""Ain't the thought..."") distances the author from ownership of the desire.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit personal suicidal intent. Leans toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes).  
   - **Conclusion**: Absence of planning elements supports 'Indicator' or 'Ideation'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post reflects on death as a concept, with no references to past actions, future intentions, or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of initiated actions or time-bound plans.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress and hopelessness but lacks a **personal, current desire to die** or act on suicidal thoughts. The abstract, poetic framing of death as ""beautiful"" suggests philosophical distress, not actionable intent.  
   - Ambiguity about genuine desire: The writer romanticizes death but does not claim ownership of suicidal urges. Per rules, **default to 'Indicator' when intent is unclear or abstract**.  
   - No plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'/'Attempt'; no desire rules out 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: feeling like an outcast, isolation (""no one I can go to""), hopelessness (""my will to live is hanging by a thread""), and burden (""friends don't care"").
   - **Explicit suicidal intent**: ""if I'm positive, I'll kill myself"" and ""use any method I can as long as I don't see another day"" directly state a desire to die.
   - **Plan/Method**: Mentions a conditional plan (suicide if COVID-positive) and willingness to use ""any method,"" indicating a generalized but concrete intention to act. No specific tools/locations are named, but ""any method"" implies preparation/acceptance of means.
   - **Temporal Context**: The plan is future-oriented (""tomorrow,"" after results). No past suicidal actions are described (only past fear of death, now gone).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""I'll kill myself"" and ""I don't see another day"" are unambiguous expressions of a current desire to die. The writer does *not* frame these thoughts as unwanted or resisted.

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**. A clear conditional plan is stated (suicide if COVID-positive), and ""use any method"" signals intent to employ lethal means. This elevates it beyond passive ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes future intent, not past actions. No initiated suicidal behavior (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). The mention of past fear of death is irrelevant to current action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die rules this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Goes beyond desire (""I want to die"") by specifying a contingency plan and method acceptance.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Matches due to **explicit desire + conditional plan + method acknowledgment** (""any method""). While methods aren’t itemized, the broad acceptance of means and time-bound decision (post-results) constitutes preparatory intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""kill myself"" twice, ""took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" (specific method and substance), ""nothing"" (implying failure of action), and emotional distress (""burden,"" ""disappoinment""). 
   - Explicitly describes a past action: taking an entire bottle of Zopiclone (a sedative) with the intent to die. 
   - Expresses ongoing suicidal thoughts (""What shoul i do kill mslef"") and hopelessness, but the core focus is on a concrete past act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** Directly states ""kill myself"" multiple times and ""stop being a burden,"" confirming a genuine desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes.** ""Took an entire bottle o zopiclone"" specifies a method (overdose) and substance, and ""nothing"" confirms the action was initiated but failed.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a **past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action** (ingesting pills) that was carried out but failed (""and nothing""). This is a concrete suicidal act, not just ideation or planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post centers on a **past suicide attempt** (taking Zopiclone) that was interrupted/failed. This meets the 'Attempt' definition (initiated, potentially lethal action). Current distress (""What shoul i do kill mslef"") is secondary to the described attempt.  
   - Rules: Past concrete attempts take precedence over current ideation/behavior.  
   - Not 'Behavior' (no *future* plan/prep mentioned), not 'Ideation' (action occurred), not 'Indicator' (explicit desire/action present).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes feelings of distress related to being a ""short, skinny aspie guy"" with learning disabilities, including mistreatment by others, bullying in school, anger toward neurotypical people (""NTs""), and a sense of not belonging in society. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""navigate through Hell every fucking day"") and despair (""I feel like I don't belong in society"").
   - Explicit mention of suicide: The phrase ""I might kill myself"" directly references suicide/self-harm.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts; all descriptions are of past mistreatment and current emotional state.
   - The suicidal statement (""I might kill myself"") lacks imminence (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight"") and is phrased conditionally (""might"").
   - The writer expresses a genuine consideration of suicide but does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they actively resist them (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating direct suicidal intent from the author.
   - The phrase expresses a personal desire to die or not be alive, framed as a possibility in the context of despair.
   - There is no explicit negation or indication that the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present.
   - With suicidal desire expressed but no plan or preparation, this points to 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on past experiences (mistreatment, bullying) and current emotional distress. The suicidal statement (""I might kill myself"") refers to a future possibility, not a past or recent action.
   - No description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed), so this does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit expression ""I might kill myself"" indicates a personal desire to die, moving this out of 'Indicator' (which requires no clear suicidal intent).
   - The lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - The absence of any past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The post fits 'Ideation' because it explicitly states suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without details on how, when, or preparations.
   - Uncertainty in phrasing (""might"") does not negate the presence of ideation; it still represents active suicidal thinking.

236,Goodbye. I've been struggling with depression for god knows how long and I'm going to end it tonight by taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another while bottle of Advil. Goodbye world. I will be non existent in about a few minutes.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""end it"" (suicide), ""taking a whole bottle of extra strength Tylenol and another bottle of Advil"" (specific method/means), and ""I will be non existent in about a few minutes"" (imminent timeline).  
   - Emotional indicators: ""struggling with depression,"" hopeless tone (""Goodbye world"").  
   - Explicit desire to die with a concrete plan and imminent execution.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""I'm going to end it"" and ""I will be non existent"" directly express a desire to die.  
   - No indication of unwanted thoughts or resistance to acting.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific methods (Tylenol and Advil overdose), quantities (""whole bottle""), and timing (""tonight,"" ""in about a few minutes"") indicate a plan and imminent preparation.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""tonight,"" ""in a few minutes""), not a past action. No initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I took pills but survived"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method + preparation (acquiring pills, imminent timing) → **Behavior**.  
   - Not 'Attempt' because no past/initiated action is described.  
   - Not 'Ideation' due to presence of method/preparation.  
   - Not 'Indicator' due to clear personal desire to die.

237,"I can't remember what happened last year and it makes me so physically uncomfortable i want to kill myself. I just remember that I was really miserable. I couldnt stand being at home anymore, but for what reason? I cant fucking remember",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""i want to kill myself"" explicitly, indicating a personal desire for suicide. It also expresses emotional distress (e.g., ""physically uncomfortable,"" ""really miserable,"" frustration about memory gaps). There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The user references past misery but not any past suicidal actions. The suicidal desire is current but lacks temporal imminence (e.g., no words like ""tonight""). The stated desire (""want to kill myself"") appears genuine and not negated as unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill myself,"" which is a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (""i want to kill myself"").
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don't want to""). This leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The focus is solely on the desire to die, without any planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses past feelings of misery but no past suicidal actions. The suicidal thought (""want to kill myself"") is expressed in the present tense, indicating current ideation. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no reference to trying or attempting suicide).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal desire (""i want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires a lack of current personal desire or unwanted thoughts.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.
   - 'Ideation' fits best because the content shows a current desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no plan or action. The mention of past distress does not change this, as it is not tied to suicidal behavior.

238,"18 and not a day. Its like life wants me to kill myself on my birthday. I had plans for once, and corona ruined them. Now the last resort of my plans is also ruined. And everything is shit. My initial plan was to kill myself anyways on my birthday. I promised myself this after my first failed attempt in October. This was until my friends convinced me to have a little party. Now im sure that life is sending me the message that I should die. I'm not deserving of love or even fun. And life is right. I deserve to die and suffer while doing so. And so I will end myself on my birthday in two weeks.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" ""deserve to die,"" ""first failed attempt in October.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""life is sending me the message that I should die""), worthlessness (""not deserving of love""), and guilt (""deserve to suffer"").  
   - Plan/Method: Specific future plan (""end myself on my birthday in two weeks"") and reference to a past suicide attempt (""failed attempt in October"").  
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""in two weeks"") and past action (attempt in October).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""end myself,"" and ""deserve to die"" show a clear, current desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: A specific plan (""end myself on my birthday in two weeks"") is stated. While no method (e.g., pills, gun) is detailed, the timeframe (""in two weeks"") and contextual link to a past attempt imply preparation/planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past action: Describes a concrete, potentially lethal past attempt (""failed attempt in October"").  
   - Future intention: Explicit plan for suicide in two weeks.  
   - **Key**: The post focuses on *future* intent with a plan, not solely on the past attempt. The past attempt is mentioned as context but does not dominate the current sentiment.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and plan rule this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Desire to die is paired with a specific plan/timeline.  
   - **Not Attempt**: The post describes a *future* plan and references a *past* attempt. The current focus is on impending behavior (planning), not a recent initiated action.  
   - **Behavior**: The author expresses suicidal desire and a concrete plan (""end myself on my birthday in two weeks""). The past attempt supports urgency but does not override the current behavioral planning.

239,"Im celebrating today bros!. Today hits one month from my last suicide attempt and I must say. My suicidal thoughts kinda left. And by kinda I mean they are gone. I think about death but not about doing it! Also today's my birthday but. it's nothing really. I feel really good. From the time I realized that person that I really adored maybe is not toxic. but low key stupid and she don't deserve me, and from that moment it's a lot better. Even counting the fact that I am depressed for 2 years and that person entered my mind 6 months ago, getting rid of that person from my mind helped me almost completly, which is magic miracle. Thanks to all of you that helped me survive to this moment.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""last suicide attempt"" explicitly, referring to a past event where the author initiated a potentially lethal action. 
   - Emotional indicators are positive: the author celebrates one month since the attempt, states suicidal thoughts are gone (""they are gone""), and feels ""really good."" They mention thinking about death but not acting on it (""I think about death but not about doing it!""), indicating no current desire for self-harm. 
   - There are no references to current plans, methods, preparations, or imminent intentions for suicide. The focus is on recovery and gratitude. 
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as unwanted and in the past, with no current ideation or behavior.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide attempt"" in the past tense, but for the present, the author states suicidal thoughts are gone and denies any desire to act (""not about doing it""). There is no current expression of a desire to die or commit suicide. Thus, current intent is absent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. The only reference to suicide-related behavior is the past attempt, which is not elaborated with specifics (e.g., method or tools). For the present, there is no indication of planning or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past suicide attempt (""last suicide attempt"" one month ago) as a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action. This aligns with the 'Attempt' category definition. 
   - Current state: The author explicitly states no suicidal thoughts or actions now, only abstract thoughts about death without intent. No current or future suicidal behavior is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post describes a concrete past suicide attempt by the author, which falls under 'Attempt' regardless of current mental state. 
   - There is no current 'Ideation' (desire to die) or 'Behavior' (plan/preparation), as suicidal thoughts are stated to be absent. 
   - While the overall tone is positive and recovery-focused, the clear description of a past attempt takes precedence per the guidelines: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
   - Thus, 'Attempt' is the best fit, as the content centers on acknowledging a specific past action.

240,I can't take it anymore. I don't have anyone I can reach out to and it's frustrating to hold my tears. My eyes are burning so bad because I can't sleep anymore. I can't bring myself to do what I enjoy. I tried to go out of the house today and I felt guilty for trying to do something nice for myself. I'm so tired. I don't have a plan to hurt myself but I've been drowning in these awful thoughts and I'm so scared.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses emotional distress, including hopelessness (""I can't take it anymore""), anhedonia (""I can't bring myself to do what I enjoy""), guilt (""felt guilty for trying to do something nice""), exhaustion (""I'm so tired""), and fear (""I'm so scared""). It mentions ""awful thoughts"" but does not explicitly reference death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. The user explicitly states, ""I don't have a plan to hurt myself,"" indicating no current plan, method, or preparation. There is no mention of past suicidal actions or imminent intent (e.g., no time frame like ""tonight""). The focus is on distress and unwanted thoughts, with the author feeling scared and overwhelmed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""awful thoughts"" could imply suicidal ideation but is vague and not explicitly tied to a personal desire to die. The author negates any desire to act by stating they have no plan and express fear about the thoughts, indicating the thoughts are unwanted. This leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned. The user explicitly denies having a plan (""I don't have a plan to hurt myself""), which rules out 'Behavior'. Without any plan or method, the content does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional states and thoughts but no past or recent suicidal actions. References to ""tried to go out of the house"" relate to general self-care, not a suicidal act. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows distress and possible suicidal thoughts but lacks an explicit personal desire to die or commit suicide. The author emphasizes that the thoughts are unwanted and scary, with no plan or intent to act, aligning with 'Indicator' (general distress with unwanted thoughts). Ambiguity exists around ""awful thoughts,"" but the explicit negation of a plan and expression of fear support 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' (which requires a clear desire to die). Rules dictate choosing 'Indicator' if uncertain about genuine suicidal desire. No plan/method/preparation or past actions move this out of 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

I couldn't remember the dream all I know is it was better than this. I spend pretty much all my time worrying about wasting time and then I waste time thinking about wasting time. I have a plethora of stupid shit I've been doing. This isn't the usual 'cringe at your past self' stuff I fucking hate myself yesterday and a week before Ive met up with people and met a few new ones and I just have completely fuckin lost my social skills. I'm the fattest I've ever been, just turned twenty and hey look my dick is still the size it was when I was a fucking infant. When I get hard it's probably 3 or something inches. As if I wasn't already fucking terrified of sex for so many other reasons, im only now realizing how fucking small I am and it's pathetic and this isn't some incel bullshit but I probably won't have sex, ever, by choice because the embarrassment would kill me. This feels like a big deal in my head for hours until I convince myself (by looking online) for women who say it doesn't matter and men who say it's fine . So cool! I don't care about my dick for 30 minutes until I run into the next fucking wall. I spend all my money on stupid shit. Fat food, weed, stupid fucking little vapes that taste like soap. Threw it all away this morning said I wouldn't do it again for a while but who fucking knows Ive done this like 10 times and I always go back. I do not give a flying FUCK about money. At all. I don't care about saving. I want to die or reverse time, because as it moves forward I am fucking always worried about it. When's my dog gonna die?. I can't believe I miss highschool. I was hospitalized in highschool for depression but most of it I wasn't and I fucking knew it would get worse after highschool. All my friends/acquaintances are somewhere else getting grades visiting their girlfriends partying with frat boys. Fuckin so glad that it's alright for them. My buddy Jack said it's the best time of his life. I haven't died because of the old ""your parents will be sad dummy"" thing.

I don't wanna play video games or watch movies or listen to music or work or drive or even eat anymore. I literally don't want to eat I physically have trouble swallowing things because I don't fucking want it I'm literally a man baby and now I'm fucking crying like one. I constantly, all the time, imagine myself amputating parts of my body and burning myself, I am an absolute pussy when it comes to pain and I've never purposely hurt myself but that doesn't stop my from dismembering and hurting myself in my head. I think about my sisters, and what they think of me, and my aunts and uncles. Every family gathering is another round of job advice. Ive wanted to quit my shit delivery job for so long now and the idea of getting a new one makes me want to cut off my hands. Laying in bed as usual!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""I fucking hate being alive,"" ""I fucking hate myself,"" ""it's just so so much all the time.""  
   - Explicitly states a desire to die: ""I want to die"" and ""I think about dying every fucking day all the fucking time.""  
   - Mentions passive suicidal ideation (""I haven't died because of... your parents will be sad"") but no active plan, method, or preparation.  
   - References past depression/hospitalization but no description of a concrete suicidal act.  
   - Describes intrusive violent thoughts (self-harm imagery) but explicitly states ""I've never purposely hurt myself.""  
   - No temporal immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"") or specific means (tools, locations, substances).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""I want to die,"" ""I think about dying every fucking day."" The desire is personal and current.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. No mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). Self-harm imagery is hypothetical (""imagine myself"") and explicitly not acted upon.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes chronic ideation (""every day"") but no past or recent initiated lethal action. Past hospitalization is noted, but no suicide attempt is described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit, personal desire to die.  
   - **Behavior** is ruled out: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned.  
   - **Attempt** is ruled out: No description of an initiated lethal action.  
   - **Ideation** fits: Clear desire to die (""I want to die"") and persistent suicidal thoughts (""think about dying every day"") without a specific plan or method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense emotional and physical pain (""hurting,"" ""emotionally that it starts to hurt physically,"" ""muscles ache""), depression (""so depressed""), exhaustion (""everything is exhausting""), and hopelessness (""my own body is giving up"").  
   - It explicitly states a desire for death: ""i'm really hoping i will die in my sleep tonight.""  
   - No mention of suicide, self-harm methods, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, means), or past actions. The death wish is passive (""die in my sleep"") and relies on chance, not active intervention.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, the author explicitly expresses a desire to die (""hoping I will die""). The context is despair-driven, and there is no negation (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No** specific method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned. The phrase ""die in my sleep"" implies a passive, non-actionable wish (relying on natural causes/accident), not a plan the author controls.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes current distress and a future-oriented wish (""tonight"") but **no past or recent self-initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The author expresses a **clear desire to die** (""hoping I will die""), aligning with *Ideation*.  
   - However, there is **no plan, method, or preparation** (e.g., no active means like pills or weapons). The passive nature of ""die in my sleep"" lacks intentionality.  
   - *Behavior* requires explicit planning elements, which are absent.  
   - *Attempt* is inapplicable as no past/recent initiated lethal action is described.  
   - *Indicator* would apply only if suicidal desire was ambiguous or unwanted; here, the desire is explicit and personal.  
   - **Conclusion:** *Ideation* best fits due to the explicit desire to die without a plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly describes taking an overdose of Zoloft (6 pills/300mg) at a specific time (11:30).  
   - Emotional indicators include despair (implied by the act) and physical symptoms (nausea, sweating).  
   - Specific method/means: Overdosing on Zoloft pills is clearly stated.  
   - Past action: The author initiated a potentially lethal act (""I took 6 pills"").  
   - Imminence: The act occurred recently (stated time: ""11:30"").  
   - Desire: The phrase ""wasn't enough to kill me"" confirms intent to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention? Yes (""overdose"" in a suicidal context).  
   - Clear desire to die? Yes (""wasn't enough to kill me"" implies disappointment at survival).  
   - Unwanted thoughts? No – the act was initiated voluntarily.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method: Yes (Zoloft overdose with dosage details).  
   - Preparation: Yes (pills were acquired and consumed).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a past/recent self-initiated action (""I took 6 pills"").  
   - Action was potentially lethal (overdose) and physically enacted, even if it failed.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author describes a **concrete, initiated action** (ingesting pills) with lethal intent.  
   - This fits 'Attempt' (past/recent potentially lethal action), overriding any current ideation/behavior.  
   - Rules: The act is self-initiated and focused on the author. ""Behavior"" would apply only to plans/preparations without enacted harm; here, harm was initiated.

   - Explicit mentions: ""destined to do it,"" ""I've made my decision,"" ""Hope my plan works,"" ""there's no way I'm living in a body that has clearly given up,"" ""it's soon.""
   - Emotional indicators: Calmness (""feel so calm,"" ""at peace"") tied to the decision to end life, hopelessness about health (""body that has clearly given up"").
   - Plan/method: References a ""plan"" (though unspecified) and imminent timing (""soon"").
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""no way I'm living"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes. ""Destined to do it"" implies suicide, and ""no way I'm living"" explicitly rejects being alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes. Mentions ""my plan"" and hopes it ""works,"" confirming a concrete plan exists. Temporal urgency (""soon"") reinforces this.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Focuses on future intent (""destined,"" ""soon"") and a plan, but no description of past/initiated actions. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan (""my plan"") = **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action (ruling out 'Attempt').  
   - ""Plan"" reference distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (where no plan/method exists).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional indicators: ""Hopeless,"" ""felt hopeless for months,"" ""realizing you're hopeless is too much.""  
   - Explicitly references suicide: ""I just want to find an actual suicide forum.""  
   - No mention of specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past/current suicidal actions.  
   - No stated desire to die—focus is on hopelessness and seeking a forum. The phrase ""suicide forum"" suggests interest or distress, but not a personal intent to act.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings, not imminent intent or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide forum"" (Yes), but no personal expression like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself.""  
   - The writer does not state a desire to die; they express hopelessness and a wish to *find* a forum, implying distress or curiosity rather than active suicidal intent.  
   - Since suicidal thoughts are referenced indirectly (via seeking a forum) but not accompanied by a personal wish to die, this leans toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations mentioned. The focus is on emotional state and seeking a forum, not actionable steps.  
   - Thus, does not meet criteria for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes chronic hopelessness, no reference to past/current suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  
   - Not applicable for 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress (hopelessness) and references suicide indirectly through seeking a forum, but lacks a clear, personal desire to die or commit suicide.  
   - Absence of explicit suicidal intent, plan, method, or past action rules out 'Ideation', 'Behavior', and 'Attempt'.  
   - Fits 'Indicator' due to abstract suicide reference (forum) and emotional distress without personal intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of self-harm/suicide: Explicitly states ""on the verge of trying to slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Despair (""disgusting to look at,"" ""how low my expectations""), hopelessness (""idc just want an end""), and feeling unsupported (""Why couldn't I get even that?"").  
   - Specific method: ""slash my wrists"" is a clear, lethal method.  
   - Imminence: ""on the verge of trying"" implies urgency.  
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""just want an end,"" confirming a genuine wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""slash my wrists and die"" and ""just want an end"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:

   - Mentions ""I cannot wait to die because at least the pain will all be gone"" – indicating explicit desire to die and hopelessness.  
   - References preparations: ""ill fix all of the funeral costs so nobody will have to worry about it.""  
   - No explicit method (e.g., pills, weapons) or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") mentioned.  
   - Strong emotional distress: rejects reassurances (""bullshit phase""), feels isolated (""no-one I know has gone through..."").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I cannot wait to die"" is a clear, personal desire to die to end pain. No negation of intent (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Fix all of the funeral costs"" explicitly indicates practical preparations tied to death, falling under ""preparations"" (similar to writing a note/giving things away).  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills) or location, but preparations alone qualify for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future intentions (""cannot wait to die,"" arranging funeral costs).  
   - **No** mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""cannot wait to die"") + preparations (funeral costs) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from 'Ideation': Preparations push it beyond mere desire/thoughts.  
   - Not 'Attempt': No described initiated action.  
   - Not 'Indicator': Desire is explicit and personal, not abstract/unwanted.

248,"if life won't ever be as good again, what's really the point?. does anybody have some wisdom to share about the following dilemma:. the summer of my life is over. i have enjoyed perfect happiness. everything that made my happiness has now left me. i'm destined to live a depressed life because i can't see my future being anywhere near as beautiful as my past. (Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent)",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of hopelessness and despair, specifically stating that ""life won't ever be as good again,"" ""the summer of my life is over,"" and ""I'm destined to live a depressed life."" It references past happiness that has been lost and an inability to see a positive future, indicating anhedonia (loss of pleasure) and a sense of burden (""Forgive me if I am being egoic / self-indulgent""). However, there are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. The author questions ""what's really the point?"" but this is framed as a philosophical dilemma rather than a direct suicidal threat. The request for ""wisdom to share"" suggests distress but also a desire for support or coping strategies. No temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated, and the focus is on emotional pain rather than actionable intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The post does not express a clear desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I want to be gone"" or ""I wish I weren't alive""). Instead, the author discusses unhappiness and a bleak outlook, with suicidal thoughts not referenced at all. The absence of any suicidal language or negation of such thoughts (e.g., ""I don't want to die"") means this leans toward 'Indicator' due to the focus on distress without suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means) is mentioned. The content is entirely about emotional state and abstract questioning, with no planning elements for suicide. This absence rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past happiness and current/future despair, but there is no reference to any past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated self-harm, attempts, or interventions). The content is contemplative and lacks any action-oriented language, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows significant distress, hopelessness, and anhedonia, but without any explicit personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or past action. The questioning of life's point is vague and philosophical, not a declaration of suicidal intent. According to the rules, if there is ambiguity about suicidal desire (e.g., ""what's the point?"" could be misconstrued but isn't explicit), 'Indicator' should be chosen. The request for wisdom also supports this, as it indicates a focus on seeking help rather than acting on suicidal impulses. Thus, 'Indicator' is the best fit, as it captures general distress without escalating to ideation, behavior, or attempt.

I live in NYC and I'm just here to find out what's the best bet if I where to jump from a bridge which one do I have the highest chance of death but even if no one answers I'm gonna pick one by the weekend so wish me luck hopefully everything pans out the way I want,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""jump from a bridge,"" which is a specific method of suicide, and ""highest chance of death,"" indicating a focus on lethality.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I doubt anyone will answer me"") and a stated desire for death (""hopefully everything pans out the way I want"").
   - Specific plan/method: Jumping from a bridge is explicitly mentioned, and the author is researching which bridge in NYC has the highest chance of death, showing preparation.
   - Preparation: The author is gathering information to inform their choice, and they set a timeline (""by the weekend"").
   - Imminence: The phrase ""by the weekend"" indicates a near-future intention.
   - Stated desire: The author expresses a clear wish to die (e.g., ""highest chance of death,"" ""hopefully everything pans out""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""jump from a bridge"" is a well-known suicide method, and the context (e.g., ""highest chance of death"") makes the suicidal intent explicit and personal.
   - The desire to die is clear and not negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to"").
   - Conclusion: Explicit intent is present, so not 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: jumping from a bridge.
   - Preparation is indicated by the author seeking information to choose a bridge with high lethality, which is a form of planning.
   - This points to 'Behavior' because there is a method and active preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I'm gonna pick one by the weekend""), not past actions.
   - There is no mention of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no description of a past attempt).
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post goes beyond general distress ('Indicator') by expressing a personal desire to die.
   - It includes a specific method (jumping from a bridge) and preparation (researching bridges), which elevates it from 'Ideation' (thoughts without a plan) to 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Based on the rules, 'Behavior' is the best fit due to the explicit plan/method and preparation.

The pain will never loosen it's grip. This is my destiny, right? Do I deserve it?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I am convinced that I will never die, I will never be free""), feelings of isolation (""I supposed to be an alien""), worthlessness (""Do I deserve it?""), and perceived burdensomeness (""this is my place in the world"").  
   - There is **no explicit mention** of death, suicide, self-harm, or methods (e.g., pills, weapons).  
   - The author describes a state of enduring suffering (""live in pain,"" ""pain will never loosen its grip"") but **does not express a desire to die** or escape via suicide. Instead, they emphasize a resigned acceptance of eternal suffering.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die"" appear.  
   - The statement ""I will never die"" paradoxically **rejects death** as an escape, framing their pain as inescapable but **not desired**.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, wanted or unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to plans, tools, locations, or preparations for self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **ongoing emotional suffering** with no past/current actions related to self-harm or suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **hopelessness and distress** without personal suicidal desire, plans, or actions.  
   - Lacks explicit suicidal intent (""Ideation"" requires desire to die).  
   - Fits ""Indicator"" due to expressions of despair and existential pain, but **no actionable suicidal intent**.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them. At this point I really look forward to sleep. And the idea of that state lasting forever is one that is hard to turn away from.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions sister's suicide and past attempts, personal grief, unanswered call, and philosophical questioning about suicide.  
   - Expresses passive acceptance of death (""a welcome end to everything""), hopelessness (""why bother going through all of it?""), and emotional numbness.  
   - References a **past ""aborted attempt at suicide"" (6 years ago)**, but no current plan, method, or preparation.  
   - Explicitly states suicidal thoughts are unwanted due to parental impact (""I won't dispute that my parents... love me... losing two children would break them"").  
   - No imminent timeline, method, or active preparation.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything"" and ""why bother going through all of it?"" indicate a current desire to die.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not framed as unwanted** (e.g., ""my brain says X, but I don’t want to""); instead, they’re acknowledged but restrained by external factors (parents).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** mentioned for current suicidal thoughts. The only reference to means is historical (past attempt).  
   - Current ideation is passive (""welcome end,"" ""hard to turn away from"" eternal sleep) without actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past action: ""aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago"" (historical, not recent).  
   - **No initiated lethal action described recently**; only abstract longing for death.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""welcome end"") qualifies for **Ideation**.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** for current thoughts (rules out *Behavior*).  
   - Past attempt is irrelevant to current state (rules out *Attempt*).  
   - Unwillingness to act is due to external concern (parents), not internal resistance to suicidal thoughts (rules out *Indicator*).

I'm sorry to those who cared about me, but you must understand its for the best. Thank You.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""There's no hope anymore""), anhedonia (""no joy""), and emotional numbness. 
    - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I plan on doing it in the tub, there will be less of a mess."" The phrase ""doing it"" contextually refers to suicide, reinforced by the apology/farewell (""I'm sorry to those who cared...""). 
    - A specific method/location is mentioned (""in the tub"") with practical planning (""less of a mess""). 
    - No past actions (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took"") are described—only future intent. 
    - The author expresses a clear desire to die (""it's for the best"") without negating the intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - Yes. ""I plan on doing it"" implies suicide (given the context of despair and farewell), and the desire to die is unambiguous.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
    - Yes. A specific method/location (""in the tub"") is stated, along with practical considerations (""less of a mess""). Preparations include the farewell/apology (""Thank You,"" ""I'm sorry"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
    - The post describes a *future* intention (""I plan on doing it""). There is no mention of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - Suicidal desire is explicit (Ideation threshold met). 
    - The specific method (""tub"") and preparation (farewell) elevate it to **Behavior**. 
    - No concrete past/ongoing action (e.g., ""I took pills"") is described, ruling out Attempt.

253,Can someone just hug me please. I just want the pain to go away,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses emotional distress (""I just want the pain to go away"") and a plea for comfort (""Can someone just hug me please""). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. Emotional indicators include hopelessness or despair related to pain, but not anhedonia, being a burden, or explicit suicidal themes. No specific plans, methods, preparations, past actions, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The writer's stated desire is focused on alleviating pain and seeking support, not on ending life or having suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. It does not express a clear desire to die or not be alive; instead, it centers on wanting relief from pain. No suicidal thoughts are mentioned, so there is no context where the writer negates or expresses unwanted thoughts. This aligns with 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., suicide note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The absence of these elements supports 'Indicator' or 'Ideation', but since suicidal desire is absent, 'Indicator' is more appropriate.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a current emotional state, not a past event or future intention. There is no description of any initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' is not relevant.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress and a wish for pain to end but lacks any explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire to die, plan, method, or past action. This fits the 'Indicator' category, which covers distress without current suicidal intent. If there were ambiguity about suicidal desire (e.g., interpreting ""pain to go away"" as a metaphor for death), the rule dictates choosing 'Indicator'. There is no evidence to support 'Ideation' (no desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan), or 'Attempt' (no action).

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post begins with a clear statement of intent: ""REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT,"" and later reinforces suicidal thoughts (""my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it"").  
   - Emotional indicators are abundant: hopelessness (""Life is miserably unfair""), despair (""I wish I was good enough""), anhedonia (""I failed miserably""), and feelings of being a burden (""I never deserved anything"").  
   - **No specific plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, timing, or notes). The reference to ""Taking pain killers and antidepressants"" is described as a coping mechanism for ""racing thoughts"" and led to accidental addiction/health issues, not as a suicidal act.  
   - Past actions (e.g., taking pills) are framed as maladaptive coping or addiction (""secretly to cope""), not as initiated suicide attempts. The author states they ""didn't succeed"" academically, not in a suicide attempt.  
   - No imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is specified.  
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (""wanting to end it""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""END IT"" and ""wanting to end it"" are direct expressions of suicidal intent. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of a method (e.g., pills for suicide, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note). Past pill use is contextualized as coping/addiction, not suicide planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past trauma and ongoing struggles but **no concrete, initiated suicidal action**. The pill usage is attributed to coping with distress, not a suicide attempt (e.g., no ""I took pills to die"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""END IT"") places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past potentially lethal action initiated as suicide (pills were for coping, not suicide), ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - **Ideation** fits: Clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts (""wanting to end it"") but no plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post explicitly states ""I really want to fucking kill myself"" and describes suicidal thoughts returning. It details a specific plan: ""running away to the train station near my house and just lay my head on the train tracks and just let a train crush my head."" Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have no one""), despair (""Fuck my life""), and references to past self-harm (""I feel like cutting myself again"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide Intent**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" confirm a personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: A specific method (train tracks) and location (train station near their house) are explicitly stated.  
   - **Temporal Context/Action**: The plan is future-oriented (""thinking about""). No past or recent *initiated* lethal action is described (self-harm urges are mentioned but not framed as a prior suicide attempt).  
   - **Distinguishing Categories**:  
     - Strong explicit desire for suicide → Rules out *Indicator*.  
     - Specific method/location mentioned → Rules out *Ideation*.  
     - No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action → Rules out *Attempt*.  

2. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   The post shows **active suicidal desire** + **specific plan/method** (train tracks at a named location), meeting the criteria for **Behavior**. The self-harm reference is secondary to the explicit suicide plan and does not override the classification.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Explicit mentions: ""wanted to die"" (daily for 4,808 days), ""suicide attempts"" (multiple, with one described as ""most successful""), ""kill myself,"" ""intrusive thoughts,"" and profound hopelessness (e.g., ""medication resilient major depressive disorder,"" desire to be a ""zombie"").
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme anger (""jealous and pissed as fuck""), hopelessness (""forced to live""), and burden (""People fail to make me happy, and in return get depressed"").
   - Past actions: Confirms multiple ""suicide attempts,"" including one where intervention occurred (""saved by someone"").
   - Desire: Explicitly states a wish to die (""my body, my choice means I should be able to kill myself"") and frames living as involuntary (""forced to live""). No negation of suicidal desire.
   - No current plan/method/preparation: Describes past attempts but no active planning for future suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or imminent timeline mentioned for a new attempt). The ""thorazine drip"" is a hypothetical demand for sedation, not a suicide method.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I have wanted to die,"" ""kill myself,"" and defends suicide as a right (""my body, my choice""). Suicidal thoughts are presented as desired, not unwanted.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Past attempts are referenced, but no specific current plan, method, or preparation is described (e.g., no mention of acquiring means or setting a timeline for a new attempt).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past actions**: Multiple suicide attempts (initiated and potentially lethal, one requiring intervention). The ""most successful attempt"" and lack of regret confirm concrete past behaviors.  
   - **No current/future action**: Expresses ongoing ideation but no indication of imminent or planned new attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post centers on **past suicide attempts** (""I had a few suicide attempts""), which were concrete, self-initiated, and potentially lethal (one required rescue).  
   - Although current suicidal ideation is present (""Every day... I have wanted to die""), **the rules prioritize 'Attempt' when past lethal actions are clearly described**, even if current distress/ideation coexists.  
   - No current plan/preparation moves it away from 'Behavior'.  
   - Explicit desire to die and past actions rule out 'Indicator' or 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""Trying to kill myself,"" ""I'm going to try again,"" ""shame for failing"" (past attempt), ""different method,"" ""not so easy to back out of,"" and planning timeframes (""tomorrow,"" ""next week"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Guilt, pain, anger, shame, hopelessness (""I’m such a fucking loser""), and perceived abandonment.  
   - Specifics: References a past attempt (""failing"") and plans for a future attempt with a more lethal/unavoidable method. Method details are implied (requires hospitalization to stop) but not explicitly named.  
   - Imminence: Timeframe is ambiguous (""tomorrow maybe,"" ""next week,"" etc.), but intent is clear.  
   - Desire: Explicit personal desire to die (""trying to kill myself is the only thing that feels real"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases (""kill myself,"" ""try again"") and clear desire to die (""I feel anger of not being able to get over my own survival instincts""). No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Mentions a ""different method"" designed to be irreversible without intervention, showing planning and preparation. Also references past attempt (""failing"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past action: Describes a concrete past attempt (""shame for failing"").  
   - Future intention: Plans to re-attempt with a more lethal method and discusses timing (""tomorrow maybe"").  
   - **No ongoing/recent initiated action** described in the present moment.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal actions.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Plan/method/preparation is present (""different method,"" specifics about lethality).  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: While a past attempt is mentioned, the post focuses on **future intent** with new planning. Rules state that if past attempts are mentioned alongside current plans, 'Attempt' only takes precedence if the focus is on the past action. Here, the emphasis is on imminent future behavior.  
   - **'Behavior' fits**: Explicit desire to die **and** active planning (method change, preparation for irreversibility, timeframe consideration).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""Satanic Groundhog day,"" ""Brain really hurts,"" ""No income,"" ""Nothing to do,"" ""I hate everything,"" ""It's over.""
   - Explicit desire to die: ""All I want is courage to end it"" directly expresses a wish for suicide.
   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines).
   - No reference to past actions or attempts; focuses on current feelings and desire.
   - ""End it"" implies suicidal intent, but lacks actionable details or imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes: ""end it"" is a direct phrase synonymous with suicide/killing oneself.
   - Yes: ""All I want is courage to end it"" expresses a clear desire to die.
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No method (e.g., pills, gun) mentioned.
   - No preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.
   - Focus is on *lacking courage* to act, not on planning or readiness.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes current emotional state and desire.
   - No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""offing myself,"" which is a direct reference to suicide. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm not worth living""). There is a specific plan indicated by the date and time: ""April 13, 2021"" at ""13:14 hours,"" with the phrase ""I'm going out of this world at that time"" and ""I'm offing myself then."" No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned, but the exact timing is specified. The context is future-oriented (""I'm going out""), with no reference to past actions. The desire to die is explicit and personal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""offing myself,"" which is a direct phrase for suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""I'm not worth living,"" ""I'm going out of this world"").
   - There is no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or negated; the desire is stated as an intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or location is mentioned; ""offing myself"" is a general term for suicide.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains explicit expressions of desire to die: ""I dont want to live,"" ""I just want to die peacefuly,"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""It will never be better""), despair (""I hate this world""), and self-perceived burden (""piece of shit"").  
   - Mentions suicidal intent but **no specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., no overdose, weapon, note, or timeline).  
   - No references to past actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  
   - Desire to die is explicit and personal, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I want to kill myself so bad"" and ""I just want to die.""  
   - **No** statements negating desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**: No method (e.g., pills, hanging), plan, or preparation described. Drinking is mentioned as coping, not a suicide method.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current despair and intent** but **no past/ongoing actions**. References to being drunk reflect distress, not suicide initiation.

261,"Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me. I just can't do this anymore, all the upset and pain and hurt I cause. I have to make it stop.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of being a burden (""Everyone Would Be Happier Without Me""), hopelessness (""I just can't do this anymore""), and distress about causing pain (""all the upset and pain and hurt I cause""). The phrase ""I have to make it stop"" suggests a desire to end suffering but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and perceived burdensomeness. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions are present. There is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer's stated desire focuses on ending pain, but it is ambiguous whether this includes a genuine wish to die; the language leans more toward distress without explicit suicidal intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The phrase ""I have to make it stop"" implies a need to end suffering but does not clearly express a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., compared to ""I want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no statement about them being unwanted. Due to the lack of explicit suicidal intent, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tool, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned or implied. Without any plan-related elements, the post does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current emotional distress with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no description of an initiated suicide attempt). It focuses solely on feelings, not behaviors.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content indicates general distress, hopelessness, and feelings of being a burden but lacks an explicit, personal expression of a desire to die or suicidal intent. Ambiguous phrases like ""I have to make it stop"" are not sufficient for 'Ideation' without clearer suicidal language. According to the rules, if there is doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity, 'Indicator' should be chosen. There is no evidence of a plan (for 'Behavior') or a past/recent action (for 'Attempt').

I don't belong here, I don't have anything and nothing is better than this. It has to be better. I don't have anything to look forward to other than more mistakes and ruin.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions intense emotional distress: feeling lost, alone, misunderstood, self-hatred (""I hate myself""), hopelessness (""nothing is better than this""), and perceived burden (""Everyone would feel sad if I did it, but their lives would be better"").
   - Explicitly references suicidal desire: ""I would have done it already"" directly indicates a wish to act.
   - Discusses barriers to acting: fear of ""botching it"" leading to injury or hospitalization.
   - No specific method, tool, location, or preparation described (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).
   - No description of past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: ""I would have done it already"" confirms a current personal desire to die. The phrase ""done it"" contextually means suicide (reinforced by fear of ""botching it"" and outcomes like hospitalization). The writer does not negate this desire—instead, they explain why they haven’t acted *yet*.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: While suicidal intent is clear, there is no mention of a specific plan (e.g., ""I’ll use X method""), method (e.g., ""I have a gun""), or preparation (e.g., ""I saved pills""). Fear of failure (""botching it"") implies consideration of consequences but not concrete planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes **current** suicidal ideation (""I would have done it already"") but **no past or recent initiated action**. Statements are hypothetical (""if I wasn’t so afraid"") and focus on barriers, not acts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Desire to die is explicit and personal** → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation described** → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of a past/recent initiated lethal action** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Explicit desire to die without actionable plan** → Fits *Ideation*.

I feel like I'm a failure to my son, my parents, and everyone around me. Why am I even here. I serve no purpose but only suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions depression, hopelessness (""glass being empty""), and not wanting to live.  
   - Explicitly states: ""I'm more and more comfortable with leaving this life"" and ""I would say I'm suicidal.""  
   - Specifies waiting until his son is an adult (11 years away), indicating a non-imminent timeline.  
   - Explicitly negates current action: ""I don't have the balls to actually do it. And my son doesn’t deserve that.""  
   - No mention of specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. Focus is on emotional pain and passive suicidal thoughts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly uses ""suicidal"" and expresses comfort with ""leaving this life.""  
   - **However**, he clearly states he *will not act* due to his son and self-perceived lack of courage (""don't have the balls"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of methods (pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (notes, goodbyes). The future intent (""wait till he's an adult"") is vague and lacks concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No past or recent actions**: No description of initiated self-harm. All references are to feelings or future hypotheticals.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts (**Ideation** territory).  
   - **But** negates current intent to act and explicitly rejects acting due to his son. This frames the suicidal thoughts as *unwanted/distressing* rather than an active current desire.  
   - No plan/method/preparation → rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent concrete actions → rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Ambiguity between **Indicator** (unwanted thoughts) and **Ideation** (desire) is resolved by the rule: *""If in doubt due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""* Here, the explicit negation of intent (""don't have the balls,"" ""son doesn’t deserve that"") tips it to **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions long-term depression (""been depressed and feeling like shit for years & years""), hopelessness (""struggling to hold on""), and a desire to escape life (""I just want off this life""). There is no explicit mention of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. No references to plans, preparations, past actions, or imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The emotional indicators are strong (despair, anhedonia), but the core expression is about wanting relief from life rather than a clear, actionable desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or direct equivalents. The phrase ""I just want off this life"" expresses a general wish to not be alive or escape suffering, but it is metaphorical and not unambiguously a desire for death. It lacks explicit suicidal intent, and there is no statement that such thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no negation like ""but I don't want to die""). This leans toward 'Indicator' as the primary sentiment appears to be distress about life circumstances rather than a clear, personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No mention of any specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparation (e.g., notes, goodbyes). The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes ongoing feelings (""for years & years"") with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no initiated attempts, interruptions, or failures). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses significant distress and a vague wish to be ""off this life,"" but it does not include an explicit, personal desire to die by suicide (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent). The phrase ""want off this life"" is ambiguous—it could indicate a desire for life to end or merely an escape from pain—and in cases of ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, the guidelines specify choosing 'Indicator'. Since there is no plan, method, or preparation, and no past action, 'Ideation' is not met. The content fits 'Indicator' as it shows general distress and hopelessness without clear suicidal intent.

I'm 15, completely failing school, nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore, life just isn't worth it but I'm terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and all my friends",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I need to kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. It also expresses emotional distress, including hopelessness (""life just isn't worth it""), anhedonia (""nothing that I used to enjoy is fun anymore""), and concern about being a burden (""terrified of what me killing myself will do to my family and friends""). 
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The query about minimizing harm to others is a consideration but not a concrete preparation step. 
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the content focuses on current thoughts and feelings. 
   - The temporal context is general, with no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""). 
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") but also ambivalence due to concern for others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I need to kill myself,"" which is a direct and personal expression of suicidal intent. The phrase ""life just isn't worth it"" further supports a desire to not be alive. 
   - The author does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist acting on them; instead, the concern about impact on others suggests internal conflict but not a negation of the desire to die. Thus, this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or means is mentioned. 
   - No preparations are described, such as gathering tools, writing a note, or setting a date. The question about minimizing harm is contemplative but not an actionable step toward suicide. 
   - Without any clear plan or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses current suicidal thoughts and future intentions but no past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""I need to kill myself"") and suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator', which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent. 
   - The absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior', as per the guideline: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" 
   - No past or recent actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. 
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', as it expresses a personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts but without specific plans or preparations.

It's a cycle that I can't escape.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I'll be gone"" (implying future absence/death), expressions of hopelessness (""no possible way to turn my life around,"" ""no point in trying""), despair (""tired of fighting,"" ""can't escape""), and anhedonia-like symptoms (inability to make new memories due to depression). There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, notes, or goodbyes). No past suicidal actions are described. The temporal context is future-oriented (""by this time next week""), indicating imminence, but it is a prediction rather than a described action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" However, ""I'll be gone"" expresses a clear desire to not be alive, especially in the context of despair (e.g., ""no point in trying,"" ""tired of fighting""). This is similar to the Ideation examples like ""I'm going to die soon"" in a despair context. There is no negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to die""), so it does not lean toward Indicator.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) are mentioned. ""I'll be gone"" implies an outcome but lacks details on how it would be achieved. Without a plan or preparation, it cannot be classified as Behavior.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on future intention (""by this time next week"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts, interventions, or outcomes like ""I tried but failed""). It is solely about current feelings and future implications, not concrete actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The expression ""I'll be gone"" in a despair context constitutes an explicit personal desire to not be alive, aligning with Ideation (e.g., similar to ""I'm going to die soon"" as per the definition). The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out Behavior. No past actions rule out Attempt. The emotional distress alone would suggest Indicator, but the explicit desire for death/absence elevates it to Ideation. There is no ambiguity strong enough to default to Indicator, as the desire is clear and personal.

267,I hope I don't make it. I don't want to survive another attempt because all my parents will tell me is how expensive the medical bill is. I just want to die without having to hear them again.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes key elements: explicit desire to die (""I just want to die""), reference to a past suicide attempt (""another attempt""), and emotional indicators like hopelessness and distress about parental reactions.
   - ""Another attempt"" directly implies a concrete, past suicidal action initiated by the author.
   - There is a clear expression of a wish to die without surviving future attempts, but no specific plan, method, or preparation for a new attempt is mentioned (e.g., no tools, locations, or immediate timelines).
   - The temporal focus is on the past attempt (""another attempt"") and the desire for death, but not on imminent future actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with phrases like ""I hope I don't make it"" and ""I just want to die."" This is a personal, current wish, not unwanted or abstract.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations for a new attempt are mentioned. The reference to ""another attempt"" is about a past event, not current planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past suicidal action: ""another attempt"" confirms a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal event that occurred previously. This is concrete evidence of an attempt, even if interrupted or survived.
   - While there is current ideation (desire to die), the past attempt is clearly described and takes precedence for classification per the rules.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of a described past attempt (""another attempt"") meets the definition of 'Attempt' as it involves a concrete, potentially lethal action initiated by the author.
   - Although there is current suicidal ideation (""I just want to die""), the explicit reference to a past attempt overrides this for classification, as per the guidelines: ""If a post refers to such past attempts and also mentions current plans/ideation, it should still be labeled 'Attempt' if the past action is clearly described.""
   - This is not 'Indicator' due to the explicit desire to die; not 'Ideation' because it goes beyond thoughts to include a past action; and not 'Behavior' because no current plan or method is indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions intense and escalating suicidal thoughts: ""suicidal thoughts swarming my head.""
   - Expresses hopelessness and entrapment: ""too far gone,"" ""no escape from the everlasting flames of life, death is the only escape.""
   - Describes persistent daily distress: ""wake immediately with suicidal thoughts,"" ""thoughts are intense and seemingly only getting more intense.""
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., pills, location), or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) mentioned.
   - No reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, self-harm).
   - Temporal context: Focuses on current/recurring thoughts (""as the days pass,"" ""wake immediately"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal thoughts"" and frames death as ""the only escape,"" indicating a personal desire to end life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No mention of specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations. Only describes thoughts/feelings.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - Describes ongoing thoughts but **no initiated action** (past or present). Focus is on ideation, not behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (rules out *Indicator*).
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.
   - No description of concrete past/recent actions rules out *Attempt*.
   - Falls under *Ideation*: Explicit desire to die (""death is the only escape"") and suicidal thoughts, without plan/method.

269,"What constitutes a suicide attempt?. So I don't really know why it even matters to me. It's pretty fucked regardless of what you call it. It's just something I struggle to not think about. I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit. Ive not talked about this with anyone before. Idk, maybe it's just bothering me because I'm the only one that knows.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses two past events involving self-initiated actions related to suicidal methods.  
   - The first event: Testing a method until ""shortly before the point of no return"" without intent to die.  
   - The second event: Acting with ""intention of dying,"" expecting failure but hoping to proceed. The author stopped themselves.  
   - Emotional indicators: Distress about categorizing these events, isolation (""only one that knows""), and rumination.  
   - No explicit *current* suicidal desire, plan, method, or preparation. Focus is on retrospective confusion.  
   - Temporal context: Both events occurred in the past (""long enough ago""), and the author feels ""separated"" from them.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No *current* desire to die expressed. The author reflects on past intent (""intention of dying"" in the second event) but states they are now in a ""tenuously better situation.""  
   - Current language centers on confusion and unresolved feelings, not active suicidal ideation.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No *current* plan, method, or preparation described. References to methods are vague (""vaguely suicidal stuff,"" ""testing my method"") and historical.  
   - Past actions involved methods but were halted.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past actions**:  
     - First event: Non-lethal rehearsal (""testing""). Not an attempt.  
     - Second event: **Initiated action with intent to die** (""went in with the intention of dying""), stopped by self. This meets 'Attempt' criteria (potentially lethal action, interrupted).  
   - No current/future plans indicated.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The second event is a clear past suicide **attempt** (initiated action with lethal intent, interrupted).  
   - The post primarily processes this past attempt, with no current ideation/behavior described.  
   - Rules: ""Attempt"" takes precedence when a concrete past action is disclosed, even alongside reflection.  
   - Current distress is retrospective, not indicative of active suicidal desire/plan.

Because nothing ever gets better and I will never achieve my goals, that is already evident. Spare me the bullshit talk about how everything will guaranteed get better. I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love? You mean the girls that I get to watch with other guys that are better than me? Seriously. What is this pile of shit called life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""nothing ever gets better,"" ""I will never achieve my goals""), despair (""I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions""), and self-loathing (""I am the one ruining my own life,"" ""I probably deserve to suffer"").  
   - Explicit mentions of death/suicide: ""I really want to die,"" ""I’d rather die than submit to anyone,"" and rhetorical questions like ""What do I have to live for?""  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."").  
   - Temporal context focuses on enduring distress and generalized desire to die, not imminent plans.  
   - Emotional tone emphasizes anguish, betrayal, and isolation, but suicidal thoughts are presented as a current desire, not explicitly unwanted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don’t want to feel this way"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I really want to die"" and ""I’d rather die"" convey a clear, personal desire to die. No negation or expression of these thoughts as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Despite strong suicidal desire, no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) is described. The anger toward others (""Maybe I should fucking make them suffer"") is not tied to a suicidal plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses past trauma (childhood abuse, bullying) and current despair but **no description of past/ongoing suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted efforts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I really want to die"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned (only generalized desire), so 'Behavior' does not apply.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt**: No initiated actions described; past events are non-suicidal (abuse, bullying).  
   - **Conclusion**: The post fits 'Ideation'—clear personal desire to die with no plan, method, or preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions of suicide: ""contemplating suicide,"" ""looking up how to do it,"" and explicit wishes to ""jump in front of a car or stab myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""depression ruined a great life,"" ""never ending pit""), despair (""this nightmare could all be over""), and burdensomeness (implied by life circumstances).
   - Specific methods/plans: ""jump in front of a car"" and ""stab myself"" are named methods. ""Looking up how to do it"" indicates research/preparation.
   - Past actions: Researching methods (""looking up how to do it"") is mentioned, but no initiated lethal actions (e.g., no actual jumping/stabbing attempt).
   - Imminence: No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight""); desire is conditional (""wish I had the courage"").
   - Desire: Explicit desire to die (""wish I had the courage... so this nightmare could all be over"") but with self-acknowledged barrier (lack of courage).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""contemplating suicide"" and ""wish I had the courage to jump in front of a car or stab myself."" The desire to die is personal and explicit.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") are named. ""Looking up how to do it"" confirms active preparation/research into methods.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes ongoing distress and research during school hours. No mention of initiating a concrete lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to stab myself"" or ""I jumped but survived""). The phrase ""wish I had the courage"" frames the actions as hypothetical/desired but not enacted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to die + specific methods (""jump in front of a car,"" ""stab myself"") + preparation (""looking up how to do it"") meet the criteria for **Behavior**. 
   - No concrete past/recent lethal action (e.g., no description of initiating self-harm), ruling out **Attempt**. 
   - **Ideation** is insufficient due to the presence of methods and preparation. **Indicator** is ruled out by explicit personal desire to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense hopelessness (""Nothing Is Beautiful,"" ""I'm so fucking done,"" ""All my life has been... disappointment and failure""), despair, and a desire to escape (""I don't want to be here anymore,"" ""I want out so bad,"" ""I want to leave and never come back"").  
   - It references relationship betrayal and distrust but **no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, or death-related actions** by the author.  
   - The wish for collective destruction (""I wish a nuclear bomb would kill us all"") is impersonal and hypothetical, not a personal plan or desire for self-inflicted death.  
   - No methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines for suicide are indicated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""die.""  
   - Desires like ""I want to leave"" or ""I want out"" express escapism/distress but **lack clear, personal suicidal intent** (e.g., ""I want to die"").  
   - The nuclear bomb fantasy focuses on universal annihilation, not the author’s own death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific suicide plan, method, or preparations** are described or implied.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - The post discusses **current emotional pain** and past relationship trauma.  
   - **No description of past or recent self-harm/suicidal actions** by the author.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - While the post shows severe distress and a wish to escape life, it **lacks explicit desire for personal death/suicide** (ruling out *Ideation*).  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned (ruling out *Behavior*).  
   - **No initiated suicidal actions** (ruling out *Attempt*).  
   - The nuclear bomb wish is impersonal, and phrases like ""I want out"" are ambiguous about literal death. Per rules, **ambiguity leans toward *Indicator***.

273,It will all be done after I die. I want to die because I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color I'm just going to pull the trigger if a cop doesn't do it first.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions death and suicide with phrases like ""after I die,"" ""I want to die,"" and ""I'm just going to pull the trigger."" The emotional indicators include hopelessness and despair due to racial pressure (""I'm black and I have so much pressure from my skin color""). A specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger,"" which implies using a gun. There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun, writing a note) or past actions. The intention is future-oriented (""I'm just going to pull the trigger""), with no specific timeframe, but it expresses a clear desire to die. The mention of ""if a cop doesn't do it first"" refers to an external risk, not self-initiated suicide, so the focus remains on the author's own stated intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die with ""I want to die."" The phrase ""I'm just going to pull the trigger"" is a direct implication of suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as a personal choice.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""pull the trigger,"" which clearly refers to using a firearm for suicide. This constitutes a method in the context of suicidal behavior. No preparations are described, but the explicit mention of a method is sufficient to indicate planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""I'm just going to pull the trigger"") with no reference to past or recent actions. It does not describe any initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., no mention of having attempted or prepared for suicide). Thus, this is not a past or recent event.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal desire for suicide). The mention of a specific method (""pull the trigger"") elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan or method) to 'Behavior.' There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt.' The method is explicit and not vague, so there is no uncertainty that would default to 'Ideation.'
   - Therefore, the category is 'Behavior' due to the presence of suicidal intent combined with a stated method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-harm (""I hurt myself two months ago"") but frames it as a historical action without explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Expresses intense hopelessness (""No one cares,"" ""tired of putting a mask,"" ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"").  
   - **No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines like ""tonight"").  
   - Describes distress about unsupportive environment (mother, coworkers) and exhaustion.  
   - ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" implies a **desire to escape via death** but lacks concrete plans or actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""Death seems like the only place where I can be free"" indicates a personal desire to die as relief.  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None**: No mention of tools, locations, substances, or preparations. Past self-harm is noted but not tied to suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past self-harm (""two months ago"") is described but lacks context of being a suicidal act (could be non-lethal self-injury).  
   - **No initiated lethal action** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Desire to die is explicit** (""Death seems like the only place...""), meeting *Ideation* threshold.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - Past self-harm isn’t clearly a suicidal *Attempt* (no lethal intent/action described).  
   - General distress is present, but explicit desire for death prioritizes *Ideation* over *Indicator*.

I always thought everything would get better when I moved out, you know? It was kind of silly to assume, but I thought I wouldn't feel so alone and I wouldn't be sad all the time but I still am the same person with the same head. I go to class and don't get back until like 5 or 6, and then i just sit alone in my room until it's time to go to bed. And everyday the longer I'm alone the more suicidal I get.

But I know that if I told my therapist I would probably be involuntarily hospitalized, and I can't afford that.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions feeling ""more suicidal"" when alone, thinking about suicide daily, writing ""detailed plans"" in a journal, and having ""long conversations"" about suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I still am the same person with the same head""), isolation, and distress about carrying this burden alone for seven years.  
   - Explicitly states a desire to get help but fears involuntary hospitalization and financial consequences.  
   - Crucially, the writer negates intent: ""I know I would never do it"" due to fear of hell and explicitly frames suicidal thoughts as distressing but not actionable.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""the more suicidal I get,"" ""detailed plans,"" and ""think about suicide every day"" indicate explicit personal suicidal thoughts.  
   - However, the desire to die is **explicitly rejected**: ""I know I would never do it,"" showing the thoughts are **unwanted/distressing** rather than a current desire to act.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Mentions ""detailed plans"" in a journal but **no specific method, tools, location, or active preparations** (e.g., acquiring means). The journaling is a cognitive exercise, not a tangible step toward action.  
   - The writer’s explicit rejection of intent (""I would never do it"") further distances this from actionable planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts and journaling** but **no past/current initiated actions** (e.g., no overdose, self-harm, or interrupted attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but framed as **unwanted and resisted** (""I would never do it""), aligning with **Indicator** (distress about suicidal thoughts without personal desire to act).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** beyond journaling (a passive activity), ruling out *Behavior*.  
   - **No concrete past/recent actions**, ruling out *Attempt*.  
   - While suicidal ideation is acknowledged, the **dominant theme is distress about the thoughts themselves** and a plea for help, not a wish to die.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses distress and emotional pain (""I cant take it anymore,"" ""The pain is unreal"") with a sad emoji (:(). There are no mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations. The language reflects hopelessness and overwhelm but lacks any reference to suicidal intent, desire, or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit mentions of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - No expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to be gone"" are absent).  
   - The distress is generalized, with no indication of suicidal thoughts (wanted or unwanted).  
   → Leans toward **'Indicator'**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned.  
   → Confirms **'Indicator'** (no escalation to 'Behavior').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current emotional suffering but no past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no references to attempts, interrupted actions, or self-harm).  
   → Rules out **'Attempt'**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress/hopelessness without personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions.  
   - Ambiguity rule: Since suicidal intent is absent, **'Indicator'** is the safest fit.  
   - Distinctions:  
     - Not **'Ideation'** (no desire to die expressed).  
     - Not **'Behavior'** (no plan/method).

277,"Thanks to AA, I think I'm capable of commiting suicide sober. That's the Higher Power in action",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""commiting suicide sober,"" which directly references suicide.
   - Emotional indicators are not strongly present; the tone is matter-of-fact, with a reference to AA and Higher Power, which could imply irony or a sense of capability rather than despair.
   - No specific plans, methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current capability (""I think I'm capable"").
   - No imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") is indicated.
   - The writer's stated desire is ambiguous: ""capable of commiting suicide"" suggests an ability but not a clear current wish to die. It lacks explicit distress about unwanted thoughts or a negation of intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commiting suicide.""
   - However, it does not express a clear desire to die (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to die""). Instead, it focuses on capability (""I think I'm capable""), which is not equivalent to intent.
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but not framed as unwanted or resisted; there is no statement like ""I don't want to act on this."" This leans toward 'Indicator' due to the lack of personal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied.
   - The absence of any planning elements means this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current belief about capability, not a past or recent action.
   - No initiated suicidal action (e.g., attempt) is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of desire to die, placing it below the threshold for 'Ideation'.
   - With no plan, method, or preparation, it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria.
   - The mention of suicidal capability is abstract and could indicate general distress or risk, but due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (as per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator""), 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""drunk because I'm a piece of shit,"" ""I hate every part of my life,"" ""sick and tired."" 
   - Explicit desire to end suffering: ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be done"" (likely a typo for ""done,"" implying a wish to end life).

   - No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or references to past actions are present.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. ""I just want it to be over"" and ""I want to be done"" convey a direct desire to end life/escape suffering, framed as a personal wish. No negation of intent (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - **No**. No mention of methods (pills, weapons), plans (""tonight,"" ""next week""), or preparations (notes, acquiring means).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - Describes **current** emotional state and desire. No reference to past/initiated suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit personal desire to die (""want it to be over,"" ""want to be done"") is present, but no plan/method/preparation is indicated.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Despair is coupled with a stated wish to end life (beyond abstract distress).  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, or descriptions of concrete actions.

279,I have attempted suicide 11 times. I have embraced my role in the universe as an existential terrorist. I will use my suicide to disturb people for my own satiafaction. I hate capitalism and everyone complicit in it.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I have attempted suicide 11 times,"" indicating past suicidal actions that were initiated and potentially lethal.
   - It also states, ""I will use my suicide to disturb people,"" expressing a future-oriented desire to die by suicide for a specific purpose, but no details on method, plan, preparation, or imminence are provided (e.g., no specific tools, locations, or timing).
   - Emotional indicators include anger and a sense of purpose (""embraced my role as an existential terrorist,"" ""hate capitalism""), but these are secondary to the explicit suicide references.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die through both past actions and future intent, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates suicidal desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post directly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times and describes past attempts, confirming a clear desire to die.
   - The future statement (""I will use my suicide"") reinforces an active desire, not unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - For future suicide: No specific method, tools, preparations, or timelines are mentioned (e.g., no details on how or when the suicide will occur). The phrase ""use my suicide"" is general and lacks actionable planning elements.
   - For past actions: The attempts are referenced but not described in detail (e.g., no methods specified), so no current plan or preparation is indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post primarily describes past events: ""I have attempted suicide 11 times"" refers to concrete, self-initiated actions that were potentially lethal and occurred multiple times.
   - While there is a future intention (""I will use my suicide""), it is vague and unsupported by evidence of imminent action or specific planning.
   - The past attempts dominate the content and meet the criteria for 'Attempt' as they were initiated actions, regardless of outcome.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The core of the post is the description of past suicide attempts, which are concrete, potentially lethal actions by the author. This fits the 'Attempt' definition, as it focuses on historic actions.
   - The future suicidal intent is present but lacks specificity for a plan or method, so it does not elevate to 'Behavior'. There is no ambiguity about the desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator'. 'Ideation' is inappropriate due to the emphasis on past actions.
   - Following the rules, 'Attempt' takes precedence when past potentially lethal actions are clearly described, even with concurrent expressions of future intent.

Managed to find a job, and then get fired 2 months after. Stalked my ex on Instagram for waaay to long which only made me feel more lonely, because she started traveling, made tons of new friends etc. While I found out I have no real friends anymore. The most fucked up thing is I still think about her every day. I've been in 2 short relationships since, but still, my mind won't let me forget her. Tried to kill myself 3 times by now. I've just given up completely. I just want the pain to end. I don't recognise myself any more",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of past suicide attempts: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times by now.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""given up completely""), despair (""just want the pain to end""), identity disruption (""don't recognise myself"").  
   - No current plan/method/preparation described (e.g., no tools, timeline, or active steps).  
   - Desire to end pain is present, but linked to past actions rather than imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""Tried to kill myself.""  
   - Desire is implied (""want the pain to end""), but the explicit suicidal action (past attempts) dominates.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No current plan/method/preparation mentioned. Past attempts imply methods existed historically but are not detailed here.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past actions**: ""Tried to kill myself 3 times"" confirms initiated, potentially lethal acts.  
   - No current/future behavior or attempt described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past suicide attempts are explicitly stated and concrete (""tried"").  
   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts [...] it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - Current distress (""given up,"" ""pain to end"") does not override the precedence of past attempts.  
   - **No ambiguity**: The post confirms initiated actions (not just thoughts).

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming. End it now, the world has evolved to be tooth and claw, never ending pain, and people self righteous in sociopathy.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions death/dying/suicide: Explicit discussion of methods (shotgun, handguns, shooting through upper palate, overdosing) and fears about failed attempts.  
   - Emotional indicators: Profound hopelessness (""It doesn't get better,"" ""no miracle is coming""), isolation, despair, physical/emotional pain.  
   - Specific plans/methods: Detailed evaluation of firearms (caliber, placement) and overdose risks. References Mark Linkous's overdose outcome.  
   - Preparations: None mentioned (e.g., no note-writing, acquiring tools).  
   - Imminence: No immediate timeline (e.g., ""tonight""); focuses on fears and hypotheticals.  
   - Desire: Explicitly states fear of *accomplishing death* due to risks, but expresses a clear wish to die (e.g., ""End it now,"" ""I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""accomplish death,"" evaluating suicide methods, and ""End it now"" (contextually self-referential) show personal desire to die. Distress about methods does not negate the underlying intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (firearms: caliber/placement; overdose) are analyzed in detail. No explicit preparation (e.g., ""I bought a gun""), but method discussion indicates planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **hypothetical/future** intentions. No past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). References others' experiences (Mark Linkous), not personal attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not Indicator**: Clear personal desire to die and method evaluation exceed general distress/unwanted thoughts.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific methods (firearms/overdose) and their feasibility are discussed, indicating planning.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions.  
   - **Behavior**: Explicit desire to die **plus** detailed method analysis (firearm logistics, overdose risks) fulfills criteria for planning.

282,Can't do any of it!. Just don't want this anymore just wanna sleep and never ever wake up,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements include expressions of distress: ""Can't do any of it!"" indicates overwhelm or helplessness, and ""just don't want this anymore"" paired with ""just wanna sleep and never ever wake up"" strongly implies a desire for permanent escape or death. This metaphorical language (e.g., ""sleep and never wake up"") is a common euphemism for dying. However, there are no explicit mentions of suicide, self-harm, death, or specific methods (e.g., pills, jumping). No plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or timeframes (e.g., ""tonight"") are indicated. The emotional tone conveys hopelessness and a wish to cease existing, but it lacks detail on intent to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are used. The post expresses a clear personal desire to not be alive through the metaphorical ""never ever wake up,"" which aligns with a wish to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to feel this way""), so it leans toward suicidal ideation rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The content focuses solely on the desire to escape life, without any planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings or intentions (""just don't want this anymore""), with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no description of an initiated suicide attempt). It is entirely forward-looking but vague, with no concrete actions taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a personal desire to not be alive (""never ever wake up""), which fits the 'Ideation' definition. However, it uses metaphorical language rather than explicit suicide terminology. Since there is no plan, method, or preparation, it does not qualify as 'Behavior'. No past or recent actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'. While the desire is clear, the lack of explicitness could create ambiguity, but the phrase ""never ever wake up"" is a strong indicator of suicidal ideation. Per the rules, if there's doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator', but here the personal desire for death is unambiguous, so 'Ideation' is more appropriate. The core distinction is that 'Ideation' covers explicit personal expressions of a desire to die or not be alive, even if indirect, as long as no plan is present.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" twice, indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include exhaustion (""tired of everything""), fear (""I'm scared""), hopelessness (""What's the point""), and a plea for help.  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - No temporal markers suggesting immediacy (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The fear and request for help (""Can someone please help me"") suggest ambivalence but do not negate the expressed desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""I want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to die.  
   - The fear (""I'm scared"") and plea for help indicate distress but do not explicitly state the desire is *unwanted* (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don’t actually want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings/desires only; no past or recent suicidal actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The explicit ""I want to die"" confirms a personal desire to die, ruling out ""Indicator"" (which requires no clear desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned, so it does not meet ""Behavior"" criteria.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Fits ""Ideation"" (explicit desire to die without plan/method).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" multiple times and includes phrases like ""end it,"" indicating a focus on death or self-harm. Emotional indicators are strong, such as ""I am not ok,"" ""I cry about it,"" ""really suffering emotionally,"" ""feel so hopeless,"" and ""I will never be ok,"" all showing despair and hopelessness. Specific plans and preparations are detailed: ""I have a plan,"" ""I know where I'll attempt,"" ""I know how,"" ""I know what I need,"" and timing specifics like ""It must be a Tuesday to run away from home."" There are no references to past actions; everything is future-oriented. The writer expresses ambivalence (""idk if I should do it"") but also a persistent desire to die (""I will just suffer till I end it""). Imminence is suggested with a conditional plan (Tuesday), but not immediate.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""end it,"" ""I will just suffer till I end it""). While there is distress and crying about the thoughts, the writer does not explicitly state that the thoughts are unwanted or that they do not want to act on them; instead, the desire to die is present despite ambivalence. This leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, there is a clear plan: the writer states ""I have a plan"" and specifies knowing the location (""where I'll attempt""), method (""how""), means (""what I need""), and preparations including running away from home on a specific day (""Tuesday""). This indicates concrete planning elements, so it leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes future intentions (""I know when I can run away,"" ""It must be a Tuesday"") with no mention of any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no descriptions of attempts, interventions, or failures). The content is focused on planning, not action taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""I can't stop thinking about suicide"") would typically suggest 'Ideation'. However, the detailed plan (location, method, means, timing) moves this to 'Behavior'. The ambivalence does not negate the presence of a plan. There is no evidence of an initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the personal expression of suicidal desire and plan. Thus, 'Behavior' is the best fit.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself. I lost so many friends over the past year. Now that I've graduated college it's much harder to stay connected with people. Doesn't help that I'm unemployed and just at home until I figure out what my next move is. I've isolated myself even further due to the shame and depression I feel on a daily basis due to reasons I mentioned above. I feel so alone and like everyday I'm battling to stay alive.

   - The post uses a metaphorical scenario of being in a speeding car with no brakes, wanting to ""stop"" the anxiety and sadness by ""crashing into another car."" This implies a desire to end emotional pain through self-destructive means, with references to suicidal ideation (e.g., ""want the constant anxiety and sadness to stop by crashing"" and ""frequently come close to doing it"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no idea where I'm going""), despair (""constant anxiety and sadness""), and a sense of entrapment (""strapped with locked chains"").
   - The method (""crashing into another car"") is metaphorical and not a literal, specific plan or preparation. No real-world tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned.
   - The user describes urges (""come close to doing it"") but explicitly states they never act due to fear of surviving with pain (""never can because I'm afraid that I won't die on impact""). This indicates no initiated action—only thoughts and impulses.
   - There is no temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight""); it's a recurring feeling.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Suicide or death is not explicitly mentioned (e.g., no direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself""). However, the metaphor strongly implies a desire to die to end suffering, as crashing represents a lethal outcome. The desire is conflicted due to fear, but it is a current personal expression of wanting to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A method (""crashing into another car"") is referenced but is part of an analogy, not a concrete, real-world plan. No specific tools, substances, locations, or preparations are described. Since the method is metaphorical and not explicit, and there is uncertainty, this leans away from 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes recurring thoughts and urges (""frequently come close"") but no past or recent initiated action. ""Coming close"" refers to impulses, not a concrete attempt (e.g., no description of starting an action like taking pills). The fear prevents any actual behavior, so this does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die (to end suffering) through metaphor, falling under 'Ideation'. However, there is no specific, real-world plan, method, or preparation, ruling out 'Behavior'. The expressed thoughts are not unwanted (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""), so 'Indicator' is inappropriate. No initiated action occurred, so 'Attempt' does not apply. Ambiguity about the metaphor favors 'Ideation' over 'Behavior' per the rules.

We were supposed to meet up two mo ago but he bailed on me two days in a row. I can't get him to understand how I'm feeling and I'm so tired of this empty loneliness I feel. My job and parents abuse me too. I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including loneliness, feeling abused by job and parents, and exhaustion from emptiness.
   - Explicit suicidal intent is present: ""I'm going to kill myself. Only a matter of when."" This indicates a personal desire to die.
   - No specific method, tool, location, or substance for suicide is mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, bridges, etc.).
   - No signs of preparation are noted (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means, or saying goodbye).
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current feelings and future intention.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented (""Only a matter of when""), implying imminence but without a specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"").
   - The writer's desire is clear: ""I'm going to kill myself"" shows a genuine wish to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicide.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"").
   - No, there is no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not wish to act on them (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to""). The primary sentiment is one of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied in relation to suicide. The phrase ""kill myself"" is general and lacks detail.
   - No signs of preparation are present (e.g., no mention of notes, acquiring means, or final acts).
   - Since there is desire but no plan/method/preparation, this leans toward 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm going to kill myself"") but no past or recent actions. There is no description of an initiated suicidal act (e.g., no reference to a previous attempt or interrupted action).
   - The absence of concrete past actions rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm going to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', as 'Indicator' requires no clear personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts.
   - The lack of any plan, method, or preparation means this cannot be 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - No past or recent initiated action is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - The post fits 'Ideation': it includes a personal expression of suicidal thoughts and a desire to die, but without a specific plan, method, or preparations.
   - Rule reminder: If no plan/method is present, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'. Ambiguity about desire is not present here, as intent is clear.

290,"Death is an option. Does thinking death is an option considered suicidal thought? Like, I won't commit, but if somehow I got an accident and die (not suffering). It's not the worst outcome.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions death as an option and questions whether thinking about death constitutes a suicidal thought. It includes hypothetical scenarios like dying in an accident, with the writer explicitly stating ""I won't commit"" to suicide. Emotional indicators include a neutral or resigned acceptance of death (""It's not the worst outcome""), but there is no expression of hopelessness, despair, or burden. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions are described. The context is abstract and philosophical, focusing on the concept of death rather than personal intent. Imminence is absent, and the writer's desire is clarified as not wanting to act on any thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. While it references death, the writer negates any personal desire to act by stating ""I won't commit."" The phrasing (""if somehow I got an accident"") frames death as passive and unwanted in the context of suffering, not an active pursuit. Suicidal thoughts are discussed abstractly and questioned, but the writer distances themselves from acting on them, indicating the thoughts are not desired or endorsed.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The reference to an accident is hypothetical and external, not self-initiated. There is no indication of planning or intent to carry out an action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts and a hypothetical future scenario, but no past or recent actions are mentioned. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal act (e.g., an attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content lacks a clear, current, personal desire to die or commit suicide, as the writer explicitly states they will not act (""I won't commit""). The discussion of death is abstract and framed as a question about suicidal thoughts, not an expression of intent. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes general distress or abstract mentions of suicide without personal suicidal desire. The ambiguity about whether the thought is suicidal and the lack of desire to act further support 'Indicator' over 'Ideation'. No plan, method, or preparation is present, ruling out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions: ""kill me,"" ""last chance,"" ""tonight,"" ""planned this,"" ""have the stuff prepared.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I wish I didn’t have to do this"") but resolve to act (""im doing the right after all"").  
   - Specific plan/method: Implied via ""tonight"" (imminence) and ""the stuff prepared"" (preparations).  
   - Past actions: References a year-long plan but no initiated lethal action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Direct phrases: ""kill me"" confirms explicit suicidal intent.  
   - Desire to die: Clear (""I wont lose the oportunity""), despite conflicted feelings (""I wish i didnt have to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Specific preparations: ""have the stuff prepared"" confirms tools/means are ready.  
   - Temporal imminence: ""Tonight"" indicates urgency.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Future intention: Plans to act ""tonight,"" but no past/initiated lethal action described (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/preparation (""stuff prepared"") = **Behavior**.  
   - No past/concrete lethal action (only future intent) rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Conflict (""I wish i didnt..."") doesn’t negate plan/preparation, so not 'Ideation' or 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: Explicitly states ""kill myself"" but negates it (""too much of a pussy"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong despair (""I hate my body,"" ""no reason to fuel it,"" ""hope my body breaks down slowly"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: Explicitly describes a plan to starve themselves (""decided to stop eating altogether,"" ""starve myself"").  
   - Imminence: The plan is actively being implemented (""I've decided to stop eating"").  
   - Desire to die: Expresses a wish for death (""hope my body breaks down slowly and this just ends"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" but dismisses it. However, the subsequent starvation plan clearly indicates a desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific method is stated: ""stop eating altogether and starve myself."" Preparations are implied by the decision to act (""I've decided"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a current/future plan (starving themselves) but no past or recent *initiated* lethal action (e.g., no description of already starving for days or collapsing).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Desire to die is explicit, and a specific method (starvation) is mentioned, along with active preparation/decision. This aligns with 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts + plan/preparation).  
   - No concrete past/recent lethal action (e.g., ""I haven’t eaten for a week"") to qualify as 'Attempt'.  
   - Not 'Indicator' due to explicit desire to die and method; not 'Ideation' due to the presence of a plan.

293,"Here's the deal. I'm not ok. I haven't been ok for a very long time. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, my body is but a vessel for a cold, broken heart with a center warm to the touch.

It was during these times in my life that I have dragged my face through the muds of life. seeing and experiencing some of the worst things to ever appear on our planet, and yet somehow I'm still standing. I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses deep emotional distress (""cold, broken heart,"" ""confused and terrified,"" ""somber loneliness""), hopelessness, and a sense of isolation.  
   - It references a passive desire to ""be gone"" but explicitly states this is not consistent (""I don't always wish to be gone"").  
   - No mention of suicide, self-harm, death, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Focuses on enduring pain and confusion (""unanswered questions,"" ""loose ends""), not a desire to act.  
   - Ends with a plea for connection (""I just hope I'm not alone"") and warmth (""Much love"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **No explicit mention** of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent phrases.  
   - The phrase ""wish to be gone"" is **negated** (""I don't always wish..."") and framed as transient, not a current desire.  
   - Primary sentiment is distress about confusion/loneliness, not a wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION:**  
   - **Absent**. No references to methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide/self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION:**  
   - Discusses past suffering but **no description of past actions** (e.g., attempts). Focus is on current emotional state.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator** fits: The post shows distress, loneliness, and passive thoughts of not wanting to exist (""wish to be gone""), but explicitly frames these as unwanted/inconsistent and lacks personal desire, plan, or action.  
   - Not *Ideation*: No explicit desire to die or suicidal intent; ambiguous feelings default to ""Indicator.""

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""suicidal"" as a current state (""I'm depressed constantly, suicidal, and lonely"").  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""permanently fucked up this life""), despair (""barely having anything to look forward to""), self-loathing (""feel pathetic""), and burden perception (""hurting to delay the pain my death will cause"").  
   - Desire to escape life (""Wish I could restart on life,"" ""I want a restart"") implies a wish to not be alive in current circumstances.  
   - **No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, notes, locations), or past/current suicidal actions** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""I want a restart"" and references to ""my death"" convey a desire to escape life/not exist.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave!

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""end myself,"" and ""take my own life.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""Nothing is happening,"" ""stagnant,"" ""life was set up for failure""), despair (""destroyed my body,"" ""pathetic""), and feeling trapped (""can't quit,"" ""family will lift a fuss"").  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring tools) are mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - Imminence is vague (""I don't know if or when""); the writer speculates about future action (""if nothing changes"").  
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (e.g., ""suicide becoming more enticing,"" ""best to end myself"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""suicide becoming more enticing"" and ""end myself"" are direct expressions of suicidal desire. The writer does not negate or express distress about *unwanted* thoughts; instead, they frame suicide as a potential solution.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The post discusses ideation (""thinking about whether it would be best"") but lacks concrete details about *how* or *when* the act would occur.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions but **no past actions**. Statements like ""if I do [take my own life]"" and ""if nothing changes"" are hypothetical/future-oriented. There is no description of initiated self-harm.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die places this above *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/initiated lethal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The core content expresses a persistent desire to die with suicidal thoughts but no actionable plan, fitting *Ideation*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of self-harm: ""slit my wrists,"" using a dremel saw attachment to target the radial artery.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""not a good person,"" ""death will only benefit people,"" ""want to get it over with.""  
   - Specific plan/method: Detailed preparation (studying artery location, marking lines, selecting tools).  
   - Action initiated: States ""I just slit my wrists,"" indicating a completed act.  
   - Imminence: ""If you see this, it’s too late"" implies the action is underway/post-completion.  
   - Desire: Explicit wish to die (""my death will benefit people"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. ""Slit my wrists,"" ""my death,"" ""Goodbye"" confirm active desire to die.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post details a **concrete, potentially lethal action** already initiated by the author (""slit my wrists""), using a specific method and preparation. This meets the 'Attempt' definition (self-initiated, potentially lethal action).

I'm in semi-regular contact with him, making sure he feels okay and isn't planning anything. I don't know if anyone else is talking to him, so I have to assume I'm the only one except his therapist. The problem for me is I'm suicidal myself, having never told anyone that, and I'm starting to find it hard to keep that from him.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The author explicitly states, ""I'm suicidal myself,"" and ""I don't want to keep going myself,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts and a desire not to be alive.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of hypocrisy, internal conflict about encouraging a friend while feeling suicidal, and distress about hiding their own suicidal feelings.
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or locations.
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions; the author notes they have ""never told anyone"" about their suicidal feelings, implying no prior actions.
   - No indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon""); the suicidal feelings are described as ongoing but not time-bound.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I don't want to keep going myself"") without stating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal myself,"" which is a direct personal expression of suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the post expresses a clear desire not to be alive, as in ""I don't want to keep going myself.""
   - The author does not state that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they align with the feelings, indicating a personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or plan is mentioned in relation to the author's own suicidal thoughts.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing notes, acquiring means) are described for the author themselves.
   - The absence of any plan or preparation means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current suicidal thoughts but no past or recent actions. The author confirms no history of sharing or acting on these feelings.
   - There is no description of a specific, initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author personally expresses a desire to die and suicidal thoughts, moving this beyond 'Indicator' (which would involve only distress or unwanted thoughts without personal desire).
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - This aligns with 'Ideation': explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts or a desire not to be alive, without a specific plan or preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of blame, hopelessness, and despair (""everything is their fault,"" ""treating me different"").
   - No specific plan, method, tools, location, or preparations are mentioned (e.g., no details on how, when, or where suicide might occur).
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the statement is conditional and future-oriented (""If I become worse..."").
   - Imminence is not indicated; the phrasing is hypothetical (""if"") rather than immediate (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is expressed in a conditional context (""if I... kill myself""), but it is not explicitly stated as unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrase like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" a direct phrase indicating suicidal intent.
   - Yes, it expresses a clear (though conditional) personal desire to die or not be alive.
   - The suicidal thought is not stated as unwanted; instead, it is presented as a potential outcome based on others' actions.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), tools, location, or preparations are mentioned or implied.
   - The absence of these elements rules out 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a potential future intention (""if I... kill myself""), not a past or recent action.
   - No description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of a prior attempt), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal expression of suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") indicates a desire to die, aligning with 'Ideation'.
   - The conditional nature (""if"") does not negate the personal desire; it still constitutes suicidal ideation without a plan.
   - No plan/method/preparation is present, so it is not 'Behavior'.
   - No past action is described, so it is not 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which would apply if the desire was ambiguous, abstract, or unwanted.

It seems like an invitation by the universe to make people laugh at me for this and just push me harder. Really i dont know anymore",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: hopelessness, desperation, feeling broken, and vulnerability.  
   - Explicitly references past suicidal desire (""i wanted to die when i made that post"").  
   - Strong negation of current suicidal intent: ""i just don't want to die.""  
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for suicide.  
   - Focuses on distress about isolation, failed communication, and feeling mocked.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit past desire (""wanted to die"") is acknowledged but **actively negated** in the present (""i just don't want to die"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as *unwanted* and conflicting with their current will to live.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. The post describes drafting/deleting an emotional message, not suicide planning or acquiring means.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Past suicidal ideation (""wanted to die"") is mentioned but lacks any description of concrete action.  
   - The only ""action"" is writing/deleting a draft post—**not a suicidal act**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is distress about isolation and hopelessness, with explicit rejection of current suicidal intent.  
   - Past suicidal thoughts are disclosed but framed as *unwanted* and not acted upon.  
   - **Fits 'Indicator'**: Expresses severe distress and unwanted past suicidal thoughts without current desire, plan, or behavior.

I don't know anyone who has the same interests. I'm ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes explicit phrases: ""trying to kill myself"" and ""ready to say goodbye.""  
   - Emotional indicators: feeling like a failure, broken, lifeless, letting everyone down, social struggles.  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - No references to past actions or attempts.  
   - Ambivalence is present (""ready to say goodbye, but I'm also not""), but the core expresses current suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I just straight up am trying to kill myself."" This reflects a personal desire to die.  
   - Ambivalence (""but I'm also not"") doesn’t negate the explicit expression of intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: Mentions intent (""trying to kill myself"") but lacks specifics (how, when, tools, or preparations).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current feelings/thoughts (""at this point"").  
   - **No past/recent actions**: No mention of initiated lethal actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""trying to kill myself"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - No method, plan, or preparation → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Fits *Ideation*: Clear personal desire to die with no actionable plan or method.

301,The only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death. I hate it. My parents think that I won't do it because they've taken any means they can think of. I could do it right now. The only reason I haven't is because I'm so scared to die and I'm scared of the emptiness after death that all I can do is cry myself to sleep and hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time. It's a neverending cycle. I'm done.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" and expresses a desire to die, but this is conflicted due to fear of death. Key emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm done""), despair (""cry myself to sleep""), and ambivalence (""hope that I don't wake up and do wake up at the same time"").  
   - There is no specific method, plan, or preparation described (e.g., no mention of tools, locations, or actions like writing a note). The reference to parents taking means implies past accessibility but no current method or plan is stated.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the writer states they ""haven't"" acted due to fear.  
   - The temporal context is present-focused, with no imminent timeline (e.g., ""right now"" is hypothetical, not an immediate plan).  
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""hope that I don't wake up""), but this is tempered by fear, not explicitly unwanted thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post directly mentions ""killing myself"" and conveys a personal desire to die (e.g., ""the only thing preventing me from killing myself is my fear of death"" and ""hope that I don't wake up"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or distressing in themselves; the conflict arises from fear of death, not a rejection of the desire. This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The line ""I could do it right now"" suggests capability but lacks detail about how, and parents removing means negates current accessibility.  
   - Without an explicit plan or method, this does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. Uncertainty here defaults to 'Ideation' per rules.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses current thoughts and feelings, with no description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I haven't"" acted).  
   - No initiated, potentially lethal action is mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (""killing myself,"" ""hope that I don't wake up""), placing it above 'Indicator'.  
   - Absence of a plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify for 'Behavior'.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
   - Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the active suicidal thoughts and desire without concrete plans or actions.

The only thing keeping me here is I don't know what happens after I die. I don't know if there's a heaven (I doubt) or is it just complete blackness.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicidal intent: ""I want to die"" and ""I want to kill myself.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""nothing to live for,"" ""no point in me being alive""), isolation (""no one would miss me""), and distress about family/friendships.  
   - Fear of death is highlighted as a barrier to acting on suicidal thoughts, but the desire to die is explicitly stated.  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states: ""I want to kill myself"" and ""I want to die."" The fear of death is framed as a deterrent, not a negation of the desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No** mention of a plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations. The barrier (fear of death) is abstract, not a concrete plan element.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes **current feelings and thoughts** with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took steps"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The author explicitly expresses a **personal desire to die/suicide** (""I want to kill myself""), meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/recent initiated lethal action** is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.  
   - Fear of death complicates intent but **does not negate the expressed desire to die**, so 'Indicator' is inappropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: ""Nothing feels right,"" ""I feel like a broken human being,"" ""My being in itself is a prison,"" and ""Can't stand this anymore.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness/self-perceived burden: ""All I've done... is cause anguish and pain to those around me.""  
   - **Explicit desire to die**: ""I'm better off dead.""  
   - No references to methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - ""I'm better off dead"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive (Yes).  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., note-writing), or timelines (No).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional state (""past few months"") but no concrete past/recent suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""better off dead"") confirms **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Distress + explicit death wish ≠ **Indicator** (which requires lack of personal desire to die).

As in, my letters were written and I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions past suicidal behavior: ""I came extraordinarily close to killing myself,"" ""my letters were written,"" and ""I had a set plan which I was days away from going through with."" This indicates explicit references to suicide, specific preparations (writing suicide notes), and a plan.  
   - Emotional indicators include past despair (""It was extraordinarily painful"") but current positive resolution (""I made the decision to live,"" ""Life will be challenging... but I'll make it work,"" ""The light at the end of the tunnel is almost here"").  
   - Specific plans/preparations are described in the past tense: letters written and a set plan nearly acted upon.  
   - No imminent or current suicidal intent is expressed; instead, the focus is on recovery and moving forward.  
   - The writer's desire is explicitly negated in the present: ""I made the decision to live"" shows the past suicidal thoughts were unwanted and not acted upon, with no current desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself,"" indicating past suicidal intent.  
   - However, the desire to die is not current; it is explicitly rejected (""I made the decision to live""), and the suicidal thoughts are framed as past distress. The primary sentiment is relief and resolution, not a present wish to die.  
   - This leans toward 'Indicator' because the suicidal thoughts are unwanted and do not represent a current personal desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Specific preparations are mentioned: ""letters were written"" and ""set plan.""  
   - However, these are described in the past tense, with no indication of current planning or imminent action. The writer states they were ""days away"" but did not initiate the act.  
   - Since the plan and preparations are historical and not current, they do not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires current/future planning).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes past events: setting dates, writing letters, and having a plan, but explicitly states no action was taken (""I keep living past that date,"" ""I was days away from going through with"").  
   - There is no description of a specific, initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of attempting and failing or being interrupted mid-act). ""Came close"" implies proximity but not initiation, so it does not qualify as an 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post lacks a current, personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent; instead, it focuses on overcoming past distress.  
   - Past suicidal thoughts with a plan are mentioned, but the writer explicitly states these were not acted upon and are now resolved, aligning with 'Indicator' (unwanted thoughts without current desire).  
   - This is not 'Ideation' because there is no current desire expressed, and past plans disqualify it from 'Ideation' (which requires no plan). It is not 'Behavior' because the planning is historical, not current/future. It is not 'Attempt' because no lethal action was initiated.  
   - Given the absence of current suicidal risk and the focus on recovery, 'Indicator' is the best fit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses regret (""angry at myself for not doing it years ago"") and chronic suicidal ideation (""wished I wasn't alive and wanted things to be over fairly regularly since about 2012""). 
   - There is explicit regret for not acting on past suicidal thoughts (""wish that I had just done it the first time"") but no mention of current plans, methods, preparations, or recent actions.  
   - Emotional indicators include anger, hopelessness (""didn’t have to live through everything""), and perceived burden (""considered selfish"").  
   - All references are to past/frequent thoughts, not imminent intentions or concrete actions.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. ""Not doing it"" and ""done it"" strongly imply suicide (though indirect). Desire to die is explicit (""wished I wasn’t alive,"" ""wanted things to be over"").  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**. No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Focuses on **past/frequent thoughts** (""since 2012,"" ""first time I thought about it"").  
   - **No description of initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). Regret is about *inaction*, not a past attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit desire to die (""wished I wasn’t alive"") and suicidal thoughts (""not doing it"") are present, but **no plan/method** is indicated.  
   - Not *Indicator*: Desire is personal and explicit (not abstract/unwanted).  
   - Not *Behavior*: No plan/preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I'm depressed and suicidal"" and expresses a desire to die (""still wanting to die,"" ""ready to die"").  
   - Mentions concrete preparation: ""written a note that also includes what I want each person to receive.""  
   - Discusses barriers (administrative tasks) but reaffirms the underlying desire to die.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned.  
   - No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""suicidal"" and ""wanting to die."" The writer does not negate or reject this desire; instead, they emphasize administrative concerns as a barrier.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Preparation is confirmed via ""written a note"" with specific instructions for asset distribution. This constitutes concrete preparation.  
   - No method or plan details (tools, location) are provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts and preparation (note-writing) but no past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""tried to"" or ""took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator**: Ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Ideation**: Suicidal desire is present, but preparation (written note) pushes this beyond ideation.  
   - **Behavior**: Fits best. The note is a clear preparation step, and the author expresses persistent desire.  
   - **Attempt**: No evidence of an initiated lethal action (e.g., ""took pills"").  
   - *Key distinction*: Preparation (note-writing) moves this from *Ideation* to *Behavior*, despite administrative concerns acting as a barrier.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes a recent conflict (trespassing incident) resulting in family trouble and intense distress.  
   - Key emotional indicators: Shame (""I fucked up""), isolation (friend conflict), and explicit mention of suicidal feelings (""never been more suicidal in my life"").  
   - **Explicit suicide reference**: ""suicidal"" is directly stated.  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, or timelines for acting on suicidal thoughts.  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions (e.g., self-harm or attempts).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""never been more suicidal in my life"" explicitly expresses a current personal desire tied to suicide.  
   - No negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: The post focuses on emotional fallout from the trespassing incident. No methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - References a past non-suicidal action (trespassing) but **no initiated suicidal action** (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm).  
   - Suicidal feelings are described as current but lack actionable context.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""suicidal"") is present → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of plans/methods/preparations → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a concrete past/recent suicidal act → Rules out *Attempt*.

We are the slave and the property of the few that want us to be controlled.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses extreme distress, hopelessness, and feelings of oppression (""slaves to a fascist regime,"" ""no freedom,"" ""property of the few""). It uses historical analogies (Auschwitz, Hitler) and critiques societal control but contains **no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods**. Emotional indicators include despair and perceived lack of agency but focus on systemic issues, not personal self-harm. No plans, preparations, timelines, or references to past suicidal actions are present. The writer’s distress is societal/political, not inwardly directed toward self-destruction.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No explicit phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or equivalent.  
   - No expressions of personal desire to die or cease existing (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - The anguish is externalized (anger at the system), not internalized as a wish for personal death.  
   → **No suicidal intent identified**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No references to suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons) or locations.  
   - No indications of preparation (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   → **Absence of plan/preparation**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes abstract/systemic issues, not past/present personal actions.  
   - No initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interruptions).  
   → **No actionable suicidal behavior**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **general distress and hopelessness** but lacks personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: Distress is expressed through societal critique without explicit personal suicidal ideation. Ambiguous hopelessness without self-directed intent defaults to Indicator per rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""Heaven seems really good,"" ""I just want to die and go to Heaven,"" ""be with Jesus.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""nobody seems to think about me,"" ""I feel so alone""), despair (""it just hurts so much""), and fear of isolation (""terrifying"" about college).  
   - Specific plans/methods/preparations: **None** (no tools, locations, timelines, or preparatory actions).  
   - Past actions: **None** described.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound language (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - Desire to die: Explicitly stated (""I just want to die... more than anything else""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""I just want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to die. The context (escaping loneliness by going to Heaven) reinforces suicidal intent.

   - Describes **current feelings** and future fears but **no past or recent actions** (e.g., no mention of prior suicide attempts or initiated self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""considering suicide"" explicitly.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""hopelessness,"" ""stuck inside a nightmare,"" ""can't fucking take it anymore,"" isolation (""nobody listens""), and feeling like a burden.  
   - No specific methods, plans, locations, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""pills,"" ""note"").

   - Desire: Explicitly states ""considering suicide"" due to unbearable distress, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""I'm considering suicide.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses desire to escape suffering (""can't take it anymore"").  
   - **No** indication thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough. This has been the most tragic tale of a person I have ever heard and they're only 15. I want to help them out of this but I'm not sure I can. The only thing I can think of doing is just being there for her as much as possible and showing her love. This is hard when she doesn't open up unless I ask and it's either that's hopeless or I'm bad at it because there have been multiple suicide attempts since we started talking. This fucking sucks. Sorry for the post that is all over the place I'm having a bit of a breakdown over this.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post is written by someone expressing distress about their online friend's severe situation. The author mentions:
   - Their friend has multiple suicide attempts (per month/week).
   - The friend experiences abuse, mental health disorders (BPD, bipolar), insomnia, nightmares of self-harm, and eating disorders.
   - The author states, *""I'm suicidal myself""* but provides no details about their own suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.
   - No explicit personal desire to die, methods, plans, or past actions by the author are described. The suicidal references are either about the friend or a vague personal admission without elaboration.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The author says *""I'm suicidal myself""*, but this lacks context or elaboration about their own desire to die. It reads as a general disclosure of distress rather than a clear expression of intent. No phrases like ""I want to die"" or ""I will kill myself"" appear. The primary focus is the friend's crisis, not the author's active suicidal state.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No personal plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations by the author are mentioned. The only suicidal content is the vague reference to being suicidal, with no actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The author describes no past or recent personal actions (e.g., no mention of self-harm, attempts, or interventions). The phrase *""I'm suicidal myself""* implies a current state but lacks specificity about intent or behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses distress and discloses suicidal feelings but does not articulate a personal *desire to die*, specific plans, or actions. The statement *""I'm suicidal myself""* is ambiguous and could reflect general distress or unwanted thoughts. Without explicit desire, plan, or behavior, this falls under **Indicator** (distress about their own mental state + focus on helping another). The rules emphasize that vague or undesired suicidal thoughts without clear intent belong here, and ambiguity leans toward Indicator.

312,"Just kill me. Please! Just end my life! I beg you, end my pain.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct phrases like ""kill me,"" ""end my life,"" and ""end my pain,"" indicating a strong desire for death and relief from suffering.
   - Emotional indicators include desperation (""Please!"", ""I beg you"") and hopelessness, but there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), locations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The writer expresses a personal wish to die but does not reference any past actions, attempts, or preparations. The focus is on a plea for someone else to act, not on self-initiated plans or behaviors.
   - The desire to die is explicit and not negated (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and ""end my life,"" which are direct expressions of a desire to die.
   - Yes, the writer clearly states a wish to not be alive, with phrases like ""end my pain"" in a context of despair.
   - There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements distancing the self from the desire). Thus, this is not a case for 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied. The plea for someone else to ""kill me"" or ""end my life"" is vague and does not specify how this would be carried out.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are present.
   - Since there is no explicit plan or method, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current/future intention (""Just kill me,"" ""end my life"") but does not reference any past or recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried"" or ""I took pills""). It is solely an expression of desire.
   - No concrete, potentially lethal action by the author is described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill me,"" ""end my life"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no clear personal suicidal intent.
   - The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means this cannot be 'Behavior', as 'Behavior' requires such elements.
   - No description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., an overdose or self-harm) means 'Attempt' is not applicable.
   - Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' because it expresses a clear, personal desire to die without specific plans or methods.

313,"I think it is utilitarian for me to end my own life. I can't find a flaw in my logic. Hey. I have anger issues. They have affected the relationships I have with people. They have caused hurt to former partners, friends, and family members. A lot of the anger is self-directed. I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone. I believe that, despite the fact that I do have people who still love me, the numbers dwindle by the day, and that from a utilitarian perspective, the emotional pain that I will cause future people, and myself, is not worth my current existence on earth. I suppose I'm posting here because usually I find myself within a mind state where I believe that more pain would be created by suicide than by my future existence, but I haven't been able to convince myself of that recently, and I want to check I'm making the right decision. Plus, some part of me likely feels that killing myself is not the right thing to do, and this probably acts as a cry for help; why I should listen to that voice, I have not been able to find a reason given my logic above. Thanks, have a good day.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit mentions: ""end my own life,"" ""killing myself,"" utilitarian justification for suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""numbers dwindle by the day""), self-directed anger, guilt over causing emotional pain, feeling like a burden.
   - Desire assessment: Expresses genuine desire to die (""it is utilitarian for me to end my own life"") but acknowledges an internal conflict (""some part of me likely feels killing myself is not the right thing"").
   - Plan/method/preparation: **No specific method, tools, location, or preparations** mentioned (e.g., pills, notes, timelines). Focus is on abstract reasoning.
   - Temporal context: Discusses current suicidal ideation driven by logic. **No past/initiated actions** described (e.g., no reference to prior attempts or steps taken).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""end my own life"" and ""killing myself."" The utilitarian framing (""pain [...] not worth my current existence"") confirms a personal desire to die. The conflicted voice (""cry for help"") does not negate the expressed intent but highlights ambivalence.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: The post lacks references to a specific suicide method (e.g., overdose, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). Ideation is philosophical/logical, not operational.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **No initiated actions**: Describes ongoing thoughts and internal debate but **no concrete past/recent actions** (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal (""me,"" ""my own life""), not abstract/unwanted thoughts.
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan/method/preparation (rules out Behavior) and no initiated lethal actions (rules out Attempt).
   - **Ideation**: Clear desire to die (""end my own life"") with suicidal rationale but **no plan or actionable steps**. Internal conflict (""cry for help"") is common in ideation but doesn’t override the expressed intent.

Why isn't there a good option for us to end it all if we don't want to be here?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I don't want it anymore"" and frustration about persistent negative thoughts. Expresses hopelessness (""I won't ever be happy""), anhedonia (""everything is a chore""), and despair (""everyday is pressure"").  
   - Explicitly references suicide via gun (""can't get hold of a gun which would solve everything"") and questions the lack of options ""to end it all.""  
   - No mention of preparations (e.g., note, acquiring tools) or past actions.  
   - Temporal context: Focuses on current feelings and hypothetical future actions (""would solve everything"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" but ""end it all"" and the gun reference imply a **genuine desire to die**. The rhetorical question (""Why isn't there a good option..."") reinforces this intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method mentioned (gun) but explicitly noted as inaccessible (""can't get hold""). No alternative plan, tools, locations, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., attempts). Focus is on current ideation and hypothetical solutions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Suicidal desire is explicit** (Ideation), and a **method is mentioned** (gun), but its inaccessibility and lack of actionable plans/preparations mean it doesn’t meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.  
   - **Rule**: ""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'."" Here, the method is hypothetical, not actionable.  
   - **Distinction from Indicator**: Genuine desire to die is present (not just distress about unwanted thoughts).  
   - **No Attempt**: No past/recent lethal actions described.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""I wish I could die"" and ""curl up and die"" in response to parental conflict.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I feel like a failure""), depression, and anxiety but also includes protective factors (love for dogs, future plans, medication helping).  
   - **No explicit suicide method, plan, preparation, or past action described**. Death wishes are emotional reactions to stress (""when they yell at me""), not active intent.  
   - Acknowledges unwanted feelings but emphasizes reasons to live (dogs, graduation goals, love for parents).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Phrases like ""I wish I could die"" suggest passive ideation but **lack a genuine desire to act**. The writer states counteracting motivations (e.g., worry about dogs, future plans).  
   - **No direct phrases like ""kill myself"" or ""suicide.""** Distress is centered on situational despair, not a persistent wish to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, notes, or preparations. Death references are metaphorical (""curl up and die"") or abstract.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing emotional struggles**, not past/current suicidal actions. The phrase ""would die for them"" is idiomatic (sacrifice), not literal.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Passive death wishes (""wish I could die"") are present but **countered by protective factors and lack of intent**.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** → rules out Behavior/Attempt.  
   - Ambiguity in desire: The writer expresses distress about unwanted feelings but **no active suicidal desire**. Follows rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator/Ideation due to ambiguity, choose Indicator.""  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Distress about life circumstances, abstract death references without personal intent to act.

316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes intense emotional distress: self-disgust, disappointment, and feelings of ugliness stemming from relationship betrayal and a coping mechanism (masturbation linked to self-hatred).  
   - **Explicit suicidal language**: ""wanting to kill myself"" directly expresses a personal desire to die.  
   - **No plan/method/preparation**: No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or concrete steps (e.g., pills, notes). The phrase ""masturbating to the thought of killing myself"" frames suicide as a distressing mental image, not an actionable plan.  
   - **Temporal context**: Describes recurring thoughts and feelings (""kept thinking""), not a past or imminent action. The climax incident is a coping outcome, not a suicidal act.  
   - **Desire assessment**: The suicidal thought is expressed as an unwanted symptom of self-loathing (""terrible feeling,"" ""wanted to get it out of my head""), but the core phrase (""wanting to kill myself"") still denotes a personal wish to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The post explicitly states ""wanting to kill myself,"" confirming a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No specific method, tools, preparations, or timelines are mentioned. Suicide is referenced only as an abstract thought during a coping mechanism.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **ongoing thoughts/feelings**, not a past/future action. The masturbation incident is a behavioral response to intrusive thoughts, not a suicide attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly expresses a personal desire to die (""wanting to kill myself""), which meets the threshold for suicidal intent. However, the absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The description of past coping mechanisms (masturbation linked to suicidal thoughts) does not constitute an actual self-harm attempt, so 'Attempt' is inapplicable. While distress about the thoughts is noted, the core expression of desire to die places this above 'Indicator'.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed. Thanks for making it this far if you read the whole thing.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses suicide philosophically, questioning its negative perception and framing it as a personal escape.  
   - Explicit statements: ""I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life"" and ""wanting to end my life.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""No one is really listening""), feeling burdensome (""wanting me to force myself to continue living... so you don’t feel sad""), and isolation (""There is no support"").  
   - **No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions** are mentioned. The author references going to bed after a long shift, indicating no imminent intent.  
   - The desire to die is explicitly stated as a personal choice (""I’m the only one in control"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""end my life,"" ""I will absolutely get what I want,"" and ""wanting to end my life"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. The author does not frame these thoughts as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned. The post focuses on abstract justification and stigma, not actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes **current beliefs and desires**, not past actions. The phrase ""I will... end my life"" is future-oriented but lacks specificity or immediacy. No initiated actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits best:  
     - Explicit desire to die is present (""end my life,"" ""get what I want"").  
     - **No plan/method/preparation** (rules out 'Behavior').  
     - **No description of past/current suicidal actions** (rules out 'Attempt').  
     - The philosophical context does not negate the personal desire to die, distinguishing it from 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past self-harm (cutting) as a coping mechanism for numbness/emptiness.  
   - Describes emotional distress (crying, invalidation by others, feeling misunderstood).  
   - References others encouraging the girlfriend to kill herself, but **not the author**.  
   - Key phrases: ""wonder if it's even worth it anymore"" (vague hopelessness) and ""numb and empty inside.""  
   - **No explicit desire for suicide/death by the author**. Self-harm is framed as pain relief, not a suicide attempt.  
   - **No plan, method, preparation, or timeline for suicide**. Scars are from past self-harm, not active planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - ""Worth it anymore"" expresses hopelessness but **not a stated desire to die**.  
   - Suicidal encouragement targets the girlfriend, not the author.  
   - **Verdict: No explicit personal suicidal intent**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No mention** of suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, hanging), or preparations (e.g., notes).  
   - Self-harm (cutting) is described as a past coping mechanism, **not a suicidal act**.  
   - **Verdict: Absent**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Self-harm incident occurred **in the past** (""a few months ago"").  
   - The act was **non-suicidal** (aimed at ""reliev[ing] pain,"" not causing death).  
   - **No recent/past suicidal actions** by the author described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core theme is **distress from invalidation and emotional pain**, with past self-harm as coping.  
   - ""Worth it anymore"" suggests hopelessness but **lacks explicit suicidal desire or intent**.  
   - Self-harm is non-lethal and disconnected from suicidal ideation.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses distress/hopelessness without personal suicidal desire, plan, or behavior.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts,"" indicating awareness of suicidal mental states.  
   - Emotional distress is evident (depressive spell, hopelessness about coping, feeling unsupported).  
   - **Crucially, the writer states they would ""rather go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts"" and explicitly negates current desire/plan: ""I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point.""**  
   - No specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions are described. Barriers to care (insurance, job) are discussed, but these are contextual stressors, not suicidal preparations.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""suicidal ideation"" and ""suicidal thoughts"" are explicitly mentioned.  
   - **However, the writer directly states they do not want to act on these thoughts** (preferring hospitalization) and questions their own current risk (""not a danger to myself""). This frames the thoughts as *unwanted/distressing*, not a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, preparations (e.g., notes), or timelines are mentioned.  
   - References to hospitalization are about *preventing* action, not enabling it.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.  
   - All references to suicide are about *thoughts* or hypothetical scenarios (""than act on""), not initiated behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned but **accompanied by clear disavowal of intent to act** (""rather go to the hospital than act,"" ""not a danger"").  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or past attempt exists.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly expresses a desire to die (""I hope I die soon,"" ""Soon I will be finally dead"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""kill me inside""), feeling betrayed by family (""Fuck them! They will pay""), and despair about forced institutionalization.  
   - A specific method is implied through daily heroin use, which is a potentially lethal substance. The author links this behavior to their death wish (""Soon I will be finally dead"").  
   - There is no description of a past suicidal action (e.g., ""I tried to overdose"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I hope I die soon"" and ""Soon I will be finally dead,"" showing a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Daily heroin use is a specific, high-risk method tied to the stated death wish. The timeline (""soon"") and context (avoiding institutionalization) reinforce this as an active plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The heroin use is ongoing but described as a current behavior, not a past lethal action. No initiated suicidal act (e.g., ""I took heroin to die"") is mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: The explicit desire to die and mention of a method (heroin) as a means to achieve death qualifies as 'Behavior'.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of a past/initiated lethal action.  
   - **Indicator**: Insufficient—desire to die is explicit and personal.

321,"What position of the gun is best for hitting the brain stem. I don't care about stuff like family will miss you, going to miss out, going to regret it, or so much to live for. I genuinely do not care for any of those things.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly discusses a specific suicide method (""position of the gun"" for ""hitting the brain stem""), indicating a focus on lethality. It expresses emotional detachment and hopelessness by dismissing concerns about family, regret, or future opportunities (""I don't care... I genuinely do not care""). There is no mention of past actions or preparations, but the inquiry about method details suggests planning. No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is given, but the tone implies current intent. The writer's stated desire is implicit; they do not explicitly say ""I want to die,"" but the context shows a disregard for life and a focus on effective suicide means.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but the discussion of gun positioning for a lethal outcome strongly implies suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; instead, the indifference to positive reasons reinforces a genuine desire for death. Thus, explicit intent is present through implication, not ambiguity.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (gun to the brain stem) is mentioned and elaborated on, with the writer seeking optimal positioning for effectiveness. This constitutes a clear plan element. While no direct preparations (e.g., acquiring a gun) are stated, the detailed inquiry about method qualifies as planning behavior. Therefore, this aligns with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes no past or recent actions; it is focused on future intentions (seeking advice for a potential act). No initiated suicidal actions are mentioned, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to the explicit method discussion. It exceeds Ideation (desire without plan) because a specific method is detailed. The presence of a plan/method (gun positioning) confirms 'Behavior'. No action has been taken, so 'Attempt' is not relevant. Rules emphasize that if a plan/method is present, it is 'Behavior', and uncertainty about plan/method would default to Ideation—but here, the method is explicit.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mention of persistent suicidal thoughts: ""there hasn't been a single day that i haven't thought about killing myself. it wont leave my head.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""everything just keeps getting worse""), invalidation (""mum saw my self harm scars and got angry... told me i have nothing to be upset over"").  
   - Self-harm is mentioned but framed as past scars (not active suicidal behavior).  
   - No specific plan, method, location, or preparation (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes).  
   - No past/current suicidal actions described—only thoughts and self-harm scars.  
   - Temporal context: Thoughts are persistent but not time-bound (e.g., no ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""killing myself"" with no negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  
   - **Yes**: Expresses persistent, unwanted thoughts (""it wont leave my head"") but **does not disavow the desire to die**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Self-harm scars imply past non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI), not active planning. No method, tools, or preparations for suicide are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing thoughts and past self-harm, but **no concrete suicidal action** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose""). Self-harm ≠ suicide attempt here.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""killing myself"") + persistent thoughts, but **no plan/method/preparation**. Self-harm scars are historical and not tied to active suicide planning.  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicidal desire is personal and explicit, not abstract/unwanted thoughts (e.g., lacks ""I don’t actually want to die"").  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan/method mentioned, and no initiated lethal action.

323,"I don't know what the fuck to do anymore. No amount of sleep helps, I still feel like trash. I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself. Let's just do it. I'm sick of life",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""killing myself"" and expressions of a desire to die (e.g., ""I'm convinced my only way out is killing myself,"" ""I'm sick of life"").
   - Emotional indicators are present: hopelessness (""I don't know what to do anymore""), despair (""feel like trash""), and anhedonia (lack of relief from sleep).
   - There is no specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) described. The phrase ""Let's just do it"" suggests urgency but is vague and lacks concrete details.
   - The context is current/future-oriented, with no references to past suicidal actions or attempts.
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses direct phrases like ""killing myself"" and conveys a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I'm convinced my only way out..."").
   - There is no statement that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not intend to act on them; instead, ""Let's just do it"" reinforces the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., overdose, jumping) or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) is mentioned. The language is impulsive but lacks actionable details.
   - Without a clear plan or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on present feelings and future intentions (e.g., ""Let's just do it""), with no description of any past or recent initiated suicidal action (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed). Thus, there is no evidence of an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this beyond 'Indicator' (which requires a lack of personal suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify as 'Behavior'.
   - With no description of a past or recent initiated action, it is not an 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as the post expresses a personal desire to die with suicidal ideation but no concrete plan or behavior.

My family thinks I'm getting 'better' I haven't been in a mental hospital in 2 months but I probably should have been in one. I've tried to overdose three times since I've got out and nobody noticed. When ever I tell people I want to die they always say ' you can't do that there is people that love you' but does that really matter if I don't love myself. In fact I hate every little thing about myself and I don't understand how people can love somebody like me. I don't want to get better and here are reasons why. I don't know who I am outside of my mental illness and that is absolutely terrifying. People only care when your dead and I realized that after my first attempt at the beginning of this year. My mom never noticed the tears, the pain, the loneliness I went through. All she noticed was that my grades were dropping. Why couldn't she have noticed sooner? My depression may make me feel like shit but at the same time it has been more comforting then anything else has been and for that I choose not to get better.

My body has lost the fight and my mind has won. Goodbye.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post contains explicit mentions of suicide: ""attempt again,"" ""I want to die,"" ""tried to overdose three times,"" and ""first attempt.""  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""I give up""), self-loathing (""I hate every little thing about myself""), and perceived burden (""does that really matter if I don’t love myself"").  
   - Specific method: Overdose (mentioned in past attempts).  
   - Preparations/temporal context: ""Just a few more hours and I'm going to attempt again"" indicates imminent intent.  
   - Past actions: Three overdoses since leaving a mental hospital and a ""first attempt"" earlier in the year.  
   - Desire to die is explicit and unambiguously stated (e.g., ""my mind has won"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""I want to die,"" ""attempt again,"" and ""my mind has won"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on these thoughts"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**: Overdose is explicitly mentioned as a method in past attempts. The statement ""going to attempt again"" implies a plan, supported by imminent timing (""few more hours"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes **past attempts**: Three overdoses and a ""first attempt"" (concrete, potentially lethal actions).  
   - Describes **future intent**: Plans to ""attempt again"" imminently.  
   - Past actions qualify as suicidal behavior: Initiated, potentially lethal acts (overdoses).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The post includes **current suicidal ideation** (desire to die) and **plans for future behavior** (""attempt again"").  
   - However, it **explicitly references past suicidal actions**: Three overdoses and a prior attempt.  
   - Per the rules, if a concrete past attempt is described (even alongside current ideation/plans), **'Attempt' takes precedence** because the focus is on a historic, self-initiated, potentially lethal action.

My father is a pedophile,  my family on both sides wants nothing to do with me. And to top things off. these influences and genetics I became an alcoholic and I just want this pain to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post describes multiple sources of distress: feeling stuck at work, missing family, trauma from a friend's death, family issues (mother's illness, father's pedophilia, rejection), and alcoholism. The key phrase is ""I just want this pain to end,"" which expresses a desire for relief from suffering but does not explicitly mention death, dying, suicide, or self-harm. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""I can't anymore""), despair, and feeling overwhelmed, but there are no references to specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past suicidal actions. The desire is framed as ending pain, not a clear wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases (No).
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., phrases like ""I want to die"" are absent; ""pain to end"" implies relief but not necessarily death) (No).
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, so there is no statement about them being unwanted or unwanted. This leans toward 'Indicator' due to the lack of explicit suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation (e.g., note, means) is mentioned or implied. The focus is on emotional pain, not actionable steps toward suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past life events (e.g., friend drowning, family issues) and current feelings, but no past or recent suicidal actions are described. There is no mention of initiated suicidal behavior.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows significant distress and hopelessness but lacks an explicit, personal desire to die or commit suicide. The phrase ""I just want this pain to end"" is ambiguous and could relate to general emotional relief rather than suicidal ideation. Per the rules, if there is doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about suicidal desire, 'Indicator' is chosen. No plan, method, or past attempt is present, ruling out 'Behavior' and 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""I'm suicidal"" and expresses a belief that the author won't survive the summer (""don't think I'll make it past this summer""), indicating a personal desire to die. Emotional indicators include despair and hopelessness, amplified by the mother's dismissive reaction. The phrase ""Maybe it is time for me to fucking go"" reinforces suicidal intent. However, there is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, substances), locations, preparations (e.g., writing a note), or past actions. The timeframe ""this summer"" suggests a non-imminent intention (not immediate like ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post directly states ""I'm suicidal"" and conveys a clear desire to die through phrases like ""don't think I'll make it past this summer"" and ""time for me to fucking go."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The content focuses on admitting suicidal thoughts and emotional distress without detailing any concrete plan for carrying out suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a recent disclosure of suicidal ideation to the mother and a future-oriented belief about death (""this summer""), but there is no description of any past or recent suicidal actions that were initiated (e.g., no reference to an attempt, interruption, or failure). The admission itself is not a suicidal act.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit expression of suicidal desire and thoughts places this in 'Ideation.' There is no plan, method, or preparation to elevate it to 'Behavior,' and no description of a past or recent action for 'Attempt.' 'Indicator' is inappropriate because the suicidal intent is personal, explicit, and not framed as unwanted or abstract distress. The ambiguity rule (choosing 'Indicator' over 'Ideation' if unsure about desire) does not apply, as the desire is clear.

I was born to a mother who really didnt want me, a father who was too hard on me, a brother who never wanted much to do with me, and a sister who would scream at me and me to kill myself because no one wants me. I wasnt the daughter and sibling they deserved. And although i have a amazing relationship with my father now, he deserves a better daughter. Not one who is fucked up garbage. Like me. I have been emotionally, and mentally tortured and driven insane by my family. Raped as a child. I have been diagnosed with so many disorders that the doc called it a little bit of everything syndrome. I closed myself off and played videogames, hiding from a world that already seems to hate me. I met a 14 year old on there who was weird and told me he was 17 about to be 18, and he would play flirt with me, joke around. So I would tease back. But we were never serious, nor would we ever be. Then one day after drinking, i told him he was hot and that if he was older, i would date him. I said some really stupid shit and i have apologized to him a 1000 times. He laughed it off and said dont worry about it. And admitted he was actually 14. I swear to god i am not like that, i am not attracted to minors, i swear i am not one of those kinds of people. I would never. It was never explicit or anything like that. We were only friends. Just friends. He's states away. But now I am driving myself crazy thinking I am a monster, and maybe I am. I have made one mistake after another, i am a mistake, an accident that should have never been here. I know what you all are thinking, why dont you have friends your own age? Why are you talking to minors? The answer is i dont know how. I dont know how to be normal, i dont know how to have friends my age. I dont know how to belong in society. My doc says my mind iant developing like it should, that its a few years behind, and i have the mentality of a 16 year old. Im drowning in depression, in self hatred, and i cant take it anymore.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post details severe emotional distress, self-hatred, and feelings of worthlessness. Key elements include:
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""I should have killed myself a long time ago,"" ""I promise I won’t fail this time,"" ""Gonna be gone after this weekend.""
   - Specific method: ""I have heard hanging is painless,"" coupled with preparation: ""I’m gonna buy the right stuff. Say my goodbyes.""
   - Past actions: ""Believe me, I tried. I tried. But it didn’t work,"" indicating prior suicide attempts.
   - Temporal context: Plans are imminent (""after this weekend"") and involve concrete steps (acquiring means, farewells).
   - Desire to die is unambiguous: ""I won’t fail this time.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes. Phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""gonna be gone,"" and ""I won’t fail this time"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. No negation of suicidal thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes. The author specifies hanging as a method (""hanging is painless"") and describes active preparations: ""buy the right stuff"" and ""say my goodbyes."" This elevates the risk beyond ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Past: Describes prior suicide attempts (""I tried""), which were initiated but failed.
   - Present/Future: States a concrete plan to act imminently (""after this weekend"") with new preparations.
   - However, the *current focus* is on future behavior (preparing to attempt), not a past/completed action. The past attempt is referenced but not the primary subject.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses a clear desire to die (ruling out *Indicator*) and includes specific plans/preparations (ruling out *Ideation*). 
   - While a past attempt is mentioned, the emphasis is on imminent future actions (acquiring means, setting a timeline). This aligns with *Behavior* (plan/preparation phase). 
   - *Attempt* requires a description of a recent/concrete *initiated* action. Here, the lethal action is planned but not yet executed.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""planning on killing myself"" at ages 25 or 30.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""this life for me isn’t it"") and ambivalence (""I still have a long time to rethink,"" ""I can still seek out help"").  
   - There is **no mention of a specific method, tool, location, or preparation** (e.g., pills, gun, note-writing). The timeline is distant (8+ years).  
   - The author references a *future hypothetical* action (""if I still feel the same or worse by that age""), not a past or imminent act.  
   - The desire to die is explicit but conditional and deferred.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post directly states ""I’m planning on killing myself"" and implies a desire to die (""Adios,"" ""this life for me isn’t it"").  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted; instead, the author conditionally endorses them.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, means, or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump,"" ""gun,"" ""note"").  
   - References to ""planning"" lack concrete details and are set far in the future.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""in 8 yrs or so"") with no evidence of past or recent initiated actions.  
   - No description of a concrete, potentially lethal past action (e.g., ""I tried last week"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** places this above *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** mentioned—despite the word ""planning,"" the lack of specifics (method, tools, timeline immediacy) aligns with *Ideation*.  
   - Distant timeline (""25 or 30,"" ""8 yrs"") and absence of actionable steps further support *Ideation* over *Behavior*.  
   - No past/current suicidal actions described, ruling out *Attempt*.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions societal pressures on queer individuals perceived as male, leading to feeling like a ""threat."" 
   - References suicide statistics (""suicide rate for men is four times as high as for women"") abstractly. 
   - Expresses distress (""teetering on the edge"") and respect for cisgender men, but **no explicit personal desire to die, self-harm, or suicide**. 
   - No plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions related to suicide by the author. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or personal expressions of wanting to die. 
   - Suicide is discussed statistically/abstractly (""suicide rate""), not as a personal intent. 
   - Distress is present, but **lacks any personal suicidal desire** (e.g., no ""I want to die""). 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
   - None mentioned. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
   - No past or imminent suicidal actions described. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Distress and societal struggles are evident, but **no personal expression of suicidal thoughts, desire, plan, or attempt**. 
   - Abstract mention of suicide rates does not equate to personal intent. 
   - Fits ""Indicator"" due to general distress without personal suicidal desire.

330,My mom told me suicide is a coward way to go out. Thanks mom. Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours. Peace out all and I wish the best for you all out here struggling. :(.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post references suicide directly (""suicide is a coward way to go out"") and includes a personal, imminent threat (""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours""). The phrase ""gone"" implies death by suicide, given the context. Emotional indicators include sarcasm (""Thanks mom"") and despair (sad face emoji), with a farewell message (""Peace out all"") suggesting hopelessness or a burden. No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The focus is on a future possibility within 24 hours, with no reference to past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the author's narrative, and ""Don't be surprised if I'm gone within 24 hours"" expresses a clear, personal desire to die or not be alive, framed as a direct consequence of distress. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to act on this""), so it leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is described. The farewell (""Peace out all"") is a general expression, not a concrete preparation like writing a note. Without explicit planning elements, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""within 24 hours"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It is not describing a concrete, self-initiated lethal act that was carried out, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a personal desire to die (e.g., ""gone within 24 hours"" in a suicidal context), placing it in 'Ideation' or higher. However, the absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. The lack of any past action rules out 'Attempt'. While the 24-hour timeframe suggests imminence, it does not specify a method, so 'Ideation' is the best fit. If there were ambiguity about desire, 'Indicator' would be chosen, but here the suicidal intent is clear and personal.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of death/dying/suicide: The phrase ""it's killing me"" is used idiomatically to express extreme distress, not literal death. No explicit references to suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I don't have a choice""), despair (""forced into staying silent""), self-blame (""I hate myself""), and feelings of entrapment.  
   - Plans/methods/preparations: None mentioned. Focus is on desiring legal solutions (restraining order) but feeling unable to act.  
   - Past actions: References past abuse and failed authority intervention, but no mention of past self-harm or suicidal acts.  
   - Imminence: No time-bound statements suggesting immediate risk.  
   - Desire to die: The distress centers on escaping abuse, not ending life. The phrase ""killing me"" is metaphorical.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die. The core sentiment is anguish about abuse and helplessness, not wanting death.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No references to suicide plans, tools, locations, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past trauma and ongoing distress but no initiated suicidal actions (past or present).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress, hopelessness, and trauma but lacks personal suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors. The phrase ""it's killing me"" is figurative. Falls under **Indicator** (distress without explicit suicidal intent).

332,"Three Days Changes Everything. I've been four months without self harm, until this weekend. It started with an old trigger, then every little problem, every panic attack I had learned to power through, ended with my harming. I swore to my family I could stop, I swore to the love of my life I would stop, I told myself I would stop. Now after four months I'm self harming again. What the hell makes them think this won't end badly. I'm bloodying myself up now, it's a matter of time before I kill myself. I should do it now and save time.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions self-harm (""I'm self harming again,"" ""I'm bloodying myself up now"") and explicitly states suicidal intent (""it's a matter of time before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now and save time""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""What the hell makes them think this won't end badly"") and a sense of inevitability. There are references to recent self-harm actions (this weekend and ""now""), but no specific suicide method, plan (e.g., tools, location), or preparations (e.g., note, means acquisition) are mentioned. The self-harm is described as a recurring issue, not as a suicide attempt. The desire to die is personal and current, with temporal urgency (""now"") but no concrete timeframe or imminent plan.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""I should do it now and save time""). There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as genuine and impending.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide method (e.g., pills, hanging) is mentioned or implied. Self-harm is discussed, but it is not tied to a suicide plan or method. No preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described. The statement ""it's a matter of time before I kill myself"" suggests inevitability but lacks explicit planning. Therefore, this leans toward 'Ideation' due to the absence of a clear plan/method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes recent self-harm (initiated this weekend and ongoing ""now""), but self-harm is not equated with a suicidal act; it is presented as a separate behavior that may lead to suicide. There is no description of a past or recent, concrete, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., an attempt that was initiated). The suicidal intent is future-oriented (""before I kill myself,"" ""I should do it now""), with no evidence of an initiated attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no personal suicidal intent. The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior', as there is no mention of how or when suicide would occur beyond vague inevitability. 'Attempt' is not applicable because no past or recent suicidal action is described; only self-harm (which is not necessarily suicidal) is mentioned. Therefore, the post fits 'Ideation': explicit personal desire to die with no plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post includes explicit phrases like ""someone blow my head off"" (method: firearm), ""i fucking deserve death,"" and ""please kill me.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""im fucking done""), self-loathing (""i always fucking wonder what people would think if they saw the real fucking me""), guilt (""please kill me before i hurt someone""), and despair (""im tired of these stupidass ignorant people"").  
   - A specific method (""blow my head off"") is mentioned, but it is framed as a plea for *someone else* to act, not a self-initiated plan or preparation.  
   - No past actions or preparations (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) are described.  
   - Temporal context is present-focused (""im tired,"" ""please kill me now""), but no imminent self-initiated timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit desire to die is clear (""please kill me,"" ""deserve death,"" ""blow my head off""). No negation of desire (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - A method (""blow my head off"") is referenced, but it is **passive** (requesting others to act). The author does not describe personal ownership of means, planning steps, or self-initiated preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried"") are described. The post expresses current desire and distress, not an initiated act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Intent**: Explicit desire to die → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **Plan/Method**: Method is mentioned but framed passively (reliance on others) with no evidence of personal planning/preparation → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **Action**: No description of past/recent self-initiated lethal actions → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - **Conclusion**: The post shows a clear personal desire to die with suicidal ideation but lacks a self-directed plan or preparations. → Best fits **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent: ""My only option is to cut my life short"" and ""if I ended my life right now.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I have no plan post graduation""), anxiety about the future, feeling unsupported (""my parents don’t support NEETs""), and perceived burden (""my family would have a temporary grieving process"").  
   - **No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations** are mentioned (e.g., no reference to cutting, pills, timelines like ""tonight,"" or actions like acquiring means).  
   - The desire to die is explicit and framed as a solution (""this wouldn’t be a problem""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  
   - There is **no description of past or recent actions** (e.g., no initiated suicide attempt).  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""cut my life short"" and ""ended my life"" directly express a personal desire to die. The context shows conviction (presented as the ""only option"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method/preparation**: While suicide is explicitly desired, no specific plan (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump""), tools, or preparations (e.g., ""bought pills"") are mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses **future intentions** (""if I ended my life right now"") but **describes no past/current concrete actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The author explicitly expresses a desire to die (""cut my life short,"" ""ended my life"") and frames suicide as a solution. However, there is **no mention of a plan, method, or preparation**, ruling out *Behavior*. The absence of any initiated action rules out *Attempt*. The personal desire to die distinguishes this from *Indicator* (which requires ambiguous/unwanted thoughts).

I've failed as a son, a brother, a boyfriend, a father, a employee, a friend, a grandson, a nephew and most recently I've failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all. I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die. My son who i lost custody of last year must wonder why his dad isn't there for him anymore but I don't think I can bring anything positive to raising him. My work must wonder whats happened to me, I just dissapeared without explanation but I'm guessing they've now given up on me like I gave on myself years ago. I drink, I smoke and I sniff my pain away because those are the only times I don't completely hate myself, but when I get a moment of clarity i despise myself even more. Yesterday I took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers i honestly hoped I wouldn't wake up this morning but here I am a failure once again the worst part about it is as scared as I was I was content in knowing that if I was gone I wouldn't be able to let anyone down again.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions of suicide/death: ""failed twice in the last 4 days to end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Extreme hopelessness (""Why was I born,"" ""failure""), self-loathing (""can't stand the person looking back""), guilt, isolation, substance use to cope.  
   - Specific methods/preparations: ""took 2 dozen muscle relaxers and 4 dozen pain killers"" (specific method and quantities).  
   - Past actions: ""failed twice... to end it all"" and the detailed account of the recent overdose (""yesterday I took..."").  
   - Imminence: Action occurred ""yesterday"" (very recent).  
   - Desire to die: Explicit (""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn't wake up"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes: ""end it all,"" ""I want to die,"" ""hoped I wouldn’t wake up."" No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: Specific method (muscle relaxers and painkillers) and quantities (""2 dozen,"" ""4 dozen"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a **past, concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action**: ""Yesterday I took..."" with intent to die. Action was initiated and failed (""woke up"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post includes current suicidal ideation (""I want to die"") and emotional distress, but the **key factor is the described past action**—a specific, potentially lethal overdose initiated by the author within the last 24 hours.  
   - Rules state: If a post describes a past/recent concrete suicidal action (even if failed/interrupted), it is classified as **'Attempt'**, regardless of concurrent ideation.  
   - The overdose constitutes an initiated suicide attempt, meeting the criteria for 'Attempt'.

And of course I can't consoling about it because I know some Petersonain victim blamer is going to come here and tell me to work harder; even though I am doing all the right things.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - **Key elements**: The post describes intense emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness (e.g., ""Life for many is nothing more than a total curse""), despair (e.g., ""I have nothing""), and being a burden or victim (e.g., ""bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life,"" ""My parents won't accept me""). It focuses on external factors like societal issues, unfairness, and personal struggles (e.g., South Asian Muslim culture, difficulty finding love, economic grievances). There are no mentions of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means. The author expresses a sense of entrapment and frustration but does not reference any suicidal thoughts, plans, preparations, or past actions related to self-harm.
   - **Emotional indicators**: Strong hopelessness and despair are present, but these are tied to life circumstances rather than a personal desire to die.
   - **Plan/method/preparation**: None identified.
   - **Past actions**: No references to past suicidal behaviors or attempts; the content is about ongoing suffering and societal critique.
   - **Imminence**: No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") suggesting immediate risk.
   - **Stated desire**: The author complains about life being unfair and cursed but does not express a wish to die or end their life. Distress is centered on external factors, not internal suicidal urges.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - It does not express a clear personal desire to die (e.g., no statements like ""I want to be gone"").
   - No suicidal thoughts are mentioned at all, wanted or unwanted, so this does not lean toward 'Ideation'.
   - Conclusion: No explicit suicide/death intent; this strongly leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned or implied.
   - Without any suicidal desire or plan, this cannot be 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses past and ongoing life experiences (e.g., bullying, family rejection) but does not describe any past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or initiated behaviors.
   - No concrete suicidal acts are referenced, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post fits 'Indicator' because it expresses general distress, hopelessness, and despair without any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or behavior. The content is a vent about life circumstances and societal issues, lacking explicit suicidal intent. Since there is no mention of suicide or death, and ambiguity is not present (as no suicidal thoughts are expressed), 'Indicator' is appropriate. 'Ideation' requires explicit suicidal thoughts or a desire to die, which are absent. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not relevant due to the lack of plans, methods, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions ""feeling suicidal,"" ""suicidal thoughts are getting more and more,"" and explicitly states ""the only escape to this situation is suicide.""  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""not able to deal with what's going to happen""), anxiety (""panic attacks""), and feelings of being a burden.  
   - No specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - No description of past or recent self-harm actions. Focus is on fears about consequences and escalating thoughts.  
   - Temporal context: Management decision pending ""today,"" but no imminent timeline for acting on suicidal thoughts (e.g., ""tonight"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""feeling suicidal"" and ""the only escape... is suicide"" convey a personal desire to die.  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don’t want to act on them"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**: Absence of specific methods (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - **No past/current action**: Describes escalating thoughts and distress but no initiated suicidal act (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit personal desire to die (""suicide is the only escape"") and active suicidal thoughts, but **no plan/method/preparation** (rules out Behavior) and **no past/recent action** (rules out Attempt).  
   - Distress and hopelessness support suicidal intent, moving it beyond Indicator (which requires lack of explicit desire to die).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions specific methods: ""jump in front of an Amtrak or Metrolink"" and references proximity to tracks/train schedules.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I really am up against a wall""), despair (""all I have left""), feeling like a burden (""nobody would care"").
   - Describes past actions: ""the times I have tried"" where fight/flight intervened, and a specific past attempt involving 911.
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I know the way I will end it,"" ""this is all I have left,"" though conflicted (""I really do not want to do this"").
   - Preparation: Knows train schedules, has physically positioned themselves near tracks (""jump away when I see it approaching"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. Direct phrases: ""suicide ideation,"" ""end it,"" ""attempted,"" ""jump in front of an Amtrak."" Desire is present despite ambivalence.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. Specific method (train), tools (Amtrak/Metrolink), location (tracks), and preparation (knowing schedules, physically going to tracks).

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes past attempts (interrupted by fight/flight or intervention), but focuses on current/future intent: Actively planning to overcome hesitation (""How do I stay on the tracks?""). No recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no ""I stood there today but jumped away"").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire + specific plan/method/preparation = **Behavior**. Past attempts don’t override current planning (which lacks a *recent initiated action*). The core risk is active planning to execute the method (train), not a historic attempt.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

342,"I'm free. It looks like I'm finally free to end it all. For years I felt like I couldn't kill myself because I had to ""stay alive for"" my friends. Well, I don't have anyone worth staying alive for anymore. Looks like I'm finally free to commit lifen't. This is a blessing. Finally moving forward and looking into my options to end it all. Of course there's always the possibility that I'll opt not to go through with it, but I need to have the option to end it all. So, with those obstacles out of the way, I'm free to get cracking. I'm looking into my options, getting my ducks in a row, and once I'm ready to end it, I'll make my decision. Live or die. This is a weight off my chest. It could finally be my time. If I decide to end it I'll be sure to wish you all a farewell. Goodbye for now!",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains multiple explicit mentions of suicide: ""end it all,"" ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't,"" and ""end it.""  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""no one worth staying alive for"") and relief (""weight off my chest"").  
   - Preparations are mentioned: ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and gathering ""options to end it all.""  
   - No past actions are described; all statements are future-oriented (""once I'm ready,"" ""if I decide"").  
   - The desire to die is explicit and framed positively (""blessing,"" ""free,"" ""finally my time"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""commit lifen't,"" and ""end it all"" are used.  
   - **Yes**. The author expresses a clear, current desire to die (""I'm finally free to end it all,"" ""it could finally be my time"").  
   - **No** statements negate this desire; instead, the tone is resolute (""I need to have the option"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Preparations are explicitly stated: ""looking into my options,"" ""getting my ducks in a row,"" and researching means (""options to end it all"").  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named, but the active planning phase is evident.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post discusses **future intentions** (""once I'm ready,"" ""if I decide"").  
   - **No** past or recent suicidal actions are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit desire to die and active preparations (researching methods, organizing) align with **Behavior**.  
   - The absence of a specific method is offset by concrete steps toward execution (""getting my ducks in a row"").  
   - No past/initiated lethal actions rule out **Attempt**; current plans override **Ideation**.

343,"How the fuck am I supposed to get better for myself when I want to kill myself?. Seriously? Do people not understand that I can't just go from. 'Wow I need to kill myself'. to. 'Wow I really want to take care of myself and help myself' overnight?. Like what is this fairy land? Fuck. 'Get a therapist' yeah when you're constantly suicidal, helping yourself isn't really much of an option you consider. How the fuck am I supposed to develop some positive outlook from a therapy office when I am not even in the proper perspective? It's all bullshit. People like me are sick. I should be allowed assisted suicide. It's twice as worse to tell me to stay and suffer.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal,"" and ""I should be allowed assisted suicide,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I can't just go from...""), frustration (""It's all bullshit""), and feeling trapped (""stay and suffer"").  
   - No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - The focus is on the persistent *desire* for suicide and the struggle with self-care/therapy, not on actionable steps.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine wish to die (e.g., advocating for assisted suicide) rather than framing suicidal thoughts as unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""want to kill myself,"" ""constantly suicidal,"" and ""assisted suicide"" show a clear personal desire to die. The writer does not negate or distance themselves from these thoughts (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While suicidal desire is explicit, there is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, hanging), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""at the bridge""), or preparations (e.g., ""bought a rope"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes ongoing suicidal feelings (""constantly suicidal"") but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions). References to ""assisted suicide"" are hypothetical/ideological, not descriptions of initiated acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits best:  
     - Explicit desire to die (""want to kill myself"") and personal suicidal thoughts are present.  
     - No plan/method/preparation → rules out *Behavior*.  
     - No description of past/recent initiated actions → rules out *Attempt*.  
     - The distress and frustration support *Ideation* over *Indicator* because the core sentiment is a genuine, current desire to die, not abstract distress or unwanted thoughts.  
   - *Indicator* is inappropriate: The author’s statements reflect personal suicidal intent, not just general despair or rejected thoughts.

344,Gonna end myself soon. Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac to OD on,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide with ""Gonna end myself soon,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - It specifies a method: overdosing on ""1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac,"" and shows preparation by stating the substances are already in possession (""Have"").  
   - The phrase ""soon"" implies imminence but not immediate action.  
   - No references to past actions or attempts are present; the focus is on future intent.  
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Yes, ""end myself"" is a direct phrase for suicide, and ""gonna"" expresses a clear desire to die.  
   - There is no statement suggesting the thoughts are unwanted (e.g., no ""but I don't want to"" language).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Yes, a specific method (overdosing) and means (Benadryl and Prozac) are mentioned.  
   - Preparation is indicated by possessing the substances (""Have 1g of Benadryl and 1g of Prozac"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes a future intention (""soon""), not a past or recent action.  
   - No initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., ""I took the pills"") is described; it is preparatory.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The explicit desire to die (""end myself"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear personal suicidal intent).  
   - The mention of a specific method (overdosing) and preparation (possessing the drugs) elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method).  
   - Since no concrete, initiated action is described (e.g., ""I tried to OD""), 'Attempt' does not apply.  
   - This fits 'Behavior' due to the combination of suicidal intent and explicit plan/preparation.

345,"I'm Lonely. I don't know why but I'm constantly feeling alone. When I was in kinder I was always bullied and I didn't really make much friends. The neighbors that I had before were my playmates, but I always felt that the only reason the play with me and brother was just for my brother. All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me. Right now I only have 1 close friend and she was my teacher. I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut. I kinda feel like a coward for not going through with it. I constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood. I can't talk with my mom about this because she views people who kill themselves as weak. My siblings have often told me that suicide is never the answer but I feel like I just need to do it. I'm sorry if this was too long a read.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past actions: ""I've had a knife to my wrist 3x in my life and each time I couldn't cut.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Loneliness, feeling like an inconvenience, hopelessness (""they would just be better off without me"").  
   - Explicit desire: ""I feel like I just need to do it [suicide].""  
   - Method: Knife to the wrist (implied self-harm/suicidal intent).  
   - Imagery: ""constantly imagine my family seeing me dead in a pool of my own blood.""  
   - Barriers to help: Inability to talk to family due to stigma.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The post states a personal desire (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and references self-harm/suicidal actions (knife to wrist). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. A specific method (knife to wrist) is mentioned. Preparatory actions are described (""had a knife to my wrist 3x"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past actions**: Three instances of initiating self-harm with a knife (""couldn't cut"" implies the action was started but stopped). The act of placing a knife to the wrist is a concrete, potentially lethal step.  
   - **Not hypothetical**: The writer physically engaged in the act, even if they stopped short of cutting deeply.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post describes **past initiated actions** (holding a knife to the wrist with suicidal intent) that were potentially lethal but interrupted. This meets the 'Attempt' definition: ""past or very recent, specific, self-initiated actions... even if interrupted by self or others.""  
   - Current ideation (""I feel like I just need to do it"") and method (knife imagery) are present, but the **past concrete actions** take precedence for classification.  
   - Contrasts with 'Behavior' (plan/preparation without initiated action) or 'Ideation' (desire without plan/action).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly.  
   - Emotional indicators include guilt (""fucked up stuff,"" ""not a good person""), hopelessness about being loved (""is that possible?""), and a conditional desire for love before suicide.  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, note-writing) are mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""before I kill myself"" implies a future intention but lacks imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") or concrete planning.  
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (""kill myself"") but ties it to a condition (feeling loved first), without rejecting the thought.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states ""kill myself.""  
   - **Yes**, it expresses a clear desire to die (""before I kill myself"").  
   - The suicidal thought is **not** framed as unwanted or resisted; it’s presented as a potential action.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.  
   - The suicide reference is conditional and lacks actionable details.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""I would like to feel that before I kill myself"").  
   - **No** past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - Absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of a past/recent initiated action rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The core is a personal expression of suicidal desire without operational details, fitting *Ideation*.

Now instead of a scratch or schoolwork it's the thought of suicide. You can't fix that shit.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""entire life will be filled with misery and pain""), anhedonia (""not motivated to do anything""), social isolation (""feel unwanted""), and perceived burdensomeness (""I'll never receive the attention or commitment I give"").  
   - Explicitly mentions ""the thought of suicide"" as an unfixable problem, contrasting it with solvable childhood issues.  
   - **No specific plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations** (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are described.  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., ""I tried"") are mentioned.  
   - The phrase ""thought of suicide"" indicates suicidal ideation but **lacks explicit desire to act** (e.g., ""I want to die now"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned (""the thought of suicide"").  
   - However, the framing focuses on the *thought* as an unsolvable burden rather than expressing a current, active desire to die (e.g., no ""I will kill myself"").  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to"") is present, but the emphasis is on distress about the thought’s persistence, not intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No method (pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., ""bought a rope,"" ""writing a note"") are referenced.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses **current emotional distress and suicidal thoughts** but **no past or recent actions** (e.g., ""I took pills,"" ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit mention of ""suicide"" and hopelessness confirms **suicidal ideation** (""Ideation"").  
   - **Not Indicator**: Suicide is personally referenced beyond abstract distress, and unwanted thoughts aren’t explicitly negated.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: Absence of plans, methods, preparations, or concrete past actions.  
   - **Ideation** fits: Expresses suicidal thoughts/despair without plans or actions.

It made me realize I was on the verge on becoming suicidal. Never really thought I would act it out. That's the summary of what I'm about to write. Honestly, there is so much more to life than what you and me are seeing. Life can be very beautiful and even more so to the ones that's suffered so much. For anyone that's having suicidal thoughts, I highly recommended you listening to the book: the power of now.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions past feelings of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and insomnia during lockdown. 
   - Explicitly references passive thoughts like ""what if I wasn't in this world"" and questioning if death would bring peace. 
   - States these thoughts scared the author and made them realize they were ""on the verge of becoming suicidal."" 
   - Emphasizes no intention to act: ""Never really thought I would act it out."" 
   - Ends with positive affirmations and advice for others. 
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Indirect references to death (""not in this world,"" ""gain peace"") but **no explicit phrases** like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - Expresses **unwanted thoughts**: The author explicitly states the thoughts scared them and they never intended to act. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Entirely describes **past mental state** during lockdown. 
   - **No initiated actions** described (e.g., no pills taken, no self-harm). 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as distressing but **unwanted and passive**, with no desire to act. 
   - Lack of explicit suicidal desire, plan, method, or action rules out Ideation/Behavior/Attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide. It specifies a method: ""by trying to overdose."" Emotional indicators include depression, sadness, crying, and hopelessness (""idk what to do""). The word ""again"" implies past suicidal behaviors or attempts, but no specific past actions are described in detail. Imminence is clear with ""tonight,"" suggesting immediate intent. The author expresses a personal desire to act (""I think i'm gonna try"") without any indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses direct phrases like ""end myself"" and ""end it,"" which convey a clear personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., no statement that the thoughts are unwanted); instead, the language indicates a current intent to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned: ""trying to overdose."" This constitutes a plan or method for carrying out suicide. No explicit preparations (e.g., acquiring means) are described, but the mention of a method alone qualifies for 'Behavior' under the definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post primarily describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no detailed account of a past or recent initiated action. While ""again"" suggests prior attempts, no concrete past action (e.g., ""I took pills last night"") is specified. The focus is on planning for a future act, not on a completed or interrupted attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and mention of a specific method (overdose) rules out 'Indicator' (which lacks personal desire) and 'Ideation' (which has desire but no plan/method). The absence of a described past initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt.' The combination of suicidal intent with a stated method aligns with 'Behavior.'

My death will release my pain and my tortured soul once and for all.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses deep hopelessness (""I can't fight anymore""), emotional exhaustion (""so tired that your eyelids feel as heavy as boulders""), and a belief that death is imminent (""my time on this earth is coming to an end in the next month or two"").  
   - It explicitly frames death as relief (""My death will release my pain"") and includes self-referential fatalism (""Some people just aren’t meant for this world"").  
   - No specific suicide methods (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned.  
   - The timeframe (""next month or two"") implies future intent but lacks immediacy or concrete planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""my time on this earth is coming to an end,"" ""I know I'm at the end,"" and ""My death will release my pain"" directly express the author’s personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While death is anticipated, no method, tools, locations, or preparatory actions are described. The analogy to a dying cat is metaphorical, not a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes future intentions (""in the next month or two"") but **no past or recent actions** (e.g., no mention of initiating self-harm).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: The author explicitly desires death (e.g., ""My death will release my pain""), placing this beyond general distress (Indicator).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is mentioned (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""bridge,"" ""note""), so it does not meet the threshold for Behavior.  
   - **Attempt**: Absent—no description of past/current self-injurious actions.  

**Conclusion**: The post reveals a clear, personal desire to die but lacks any disclosed plan, method, or preparation. This aligns with **Ideation**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""about to lock myself in the bathroom to do it,"" ""suicide is on my mind"") and specific methods (knife and pills).  
   - Strong emotional indicators: hopelessness (""run out of options,"" ""rock bottom""), guilt (""feel like a complete failure""), and overwhelming distress.  
   - Specific plan/preparation: ""lock myself in the bathroom with a knife and some pills"" and temporal imminence (""about to,"" ""currently 6 in the morning"").  
   - The author expresses a conflicted desire: ""I don’t want to do this"" but feels compelled due to perceived lack of alternatives.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases include ""do it"" (contextually suicide), ""suicide is on my mind,"" and ""ready to do it."" The desire is current and personal, despite conflicted feelings.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**. Specific methods (knife, pills), location (bathroom), and preparation (""lock myself"") are explicitly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes an **imminent future action** (""about to lock myself"") rather than a past act. No prior attempt is mentioned—only historical distress.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior** is appropriate: The author expresses active suicidal desire *and* details a specific plan/method (knife/pills) with immediate preparation (locking in the bathroom).  
   - Not *Indicator*: Suicidal intent is explicit and personal.  
   - Not *Ideation*: A plan/method is clearly outlined.  
   - Not *Attempt*: The action is planned but not yet initiated (no description of past/current lethal action).

352,Even when the 'fog' has lifted I still have no interest in modern life. I get windows of relief which is nice.but yet suicidal thoughts constantly round and round. I probably contemplate method over 100 times a day. What's really worrying is I'm 26 now and each year has got worse yes there's lots of factors but there's levels of depression I didn't think we're possible. As you all well know,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts constantly round and round"" and ""contemplate method over 100 times a day,"" indicating explicit references to suicidal ideation and frequent consideration of methods. Emotional indicators include ""no interest in modern life"" (anhedonia), ""levels of depression I didn't think were possible"" (hopelessness/despair), and a worsening condition over time. There is no mention of specific methods (e.g., tools, substances, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past actions (e.g., attempts). The temporal context is ongoing/present, with no imminent time frame (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer expresses distress about persistent thoughts but does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they resist the desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" and ""contemplate method,"" indicating a personal desire related to suicide. There is no explicit negation of the desire (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""), so this leans away from 'Indicator' and toward 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - The phrase ""contemplate method"" suggests thinking about methods, but it is vague and lacks specificity (e.g., no mention of pills, guns, or locations). There are no signs of preparation or concrete planning. Due to the ambiguity, this aligns with 'Ideation' rather than 'Behavior' (per the rule: if unsure about an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current, persistent thoughts (""constantly,"" ""over 100 times a day"") with no reference to past or recent initiated actions. It focuses on contemplation, not behavior or attempts. No potentially lethal actions are described, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content expresses a clear personal desire to die through explicit suicidal thoughts, placing it above 'Indicator' (which lacks such desire). However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no described actions, 'Attempt' is inapplicable. The vague contemplation of methods falls within 'Ideation' per the definition: explicit suicidal thoughts with no plan/method. The rule to choose 'Ideation' when method contemplation is unspecified applies here.

353,"Please help, I'm at my rope's end. Basically,. I was sexually assaulted and my family, not listening to me, forcing themselves  on me makes me feel the feelings of being sexually vulnerable and sexually, triggered. And I hate it so much,. So fucking much. And I want nothing more than to be fr. But I feel like I'll be here for a long timer. I gotta return to their house through Jan 19th. And I want to be saved. I've been trying to save myself. But I know no one can save me. I feel so trapped, surrounded by these feelings and the people who put me through it. Feel like I have no choice but to lock myself in a house with a mom who's become religiously insane, coddling my Autistic sister. The helplessness I feel in the situation brings up the lust feelings. I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment. My sister, who was coddled, never went to college, had a shit 3 hour a day McDonalds job. And her feeling minimally useful and getting money to spend on Ebay mattered more. So I have to fuck my life and mental health in this job over for her sake. My feelings are never listened to. The minute I get the least bit burdensome my mom expresses she is hurt HURT how dare her daughter betrays her!. I SURVIVED MENINGITIS , LOST MY RIGHT EAR WHILE I WAS AWAKE. WHAT DOES MY MOM SAY WHEN I EXPRESS TRAUMA. ""Relax, you thrived"". ""Don't blame your father"" It was totally all his fault. ""Imagine being the mom of that child! "", said to my nephew KLIKE SHUT THE FUCK UP THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU!. She brushed me aside wwhen my older sister's boyfriend was being an abusive shit to me and my nephew and helped my older sister enable him. There's just, sooo much. And at school, I'm just surrounded by radical left SJW culture (I'm moderate left) , and just their habit of blaming things on big groups of other people (""You're white, this is your fault, you should feel guilty, go educate yourself!"") They don't get how toxic that is, and I'm just, older than a lot of them so my perspective makes no sense to these kids who are in this bubble. I never got to live that normal life and my family made it ten times worse. My mom lost her job, maybe if my dad hadn't fucking retired so early, completeely, I could have still gone to college then (By the time my mom found a new job, she just asked me to drop out of the college I was set to go to, she didn't feel ready to support me). I was loyal and did that. &amp;#x200B;. And suffered through all of this hell because of that decision",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of hopelessness, being trapped, betrayal, and trauma from sexual assault and family dynamics.
   - Key phrases: ""I jsut want to die"" explicitly states a desire to die. No specific methods, plans, preparations, timelines, or past actions related to suicide are mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations, notes, or descriptions of initiated actions).
   - The author discusses past trauma (e.g., assault, family neglect, health issues) but does not reference past suicide attempts or self-harm actions. Mentions of ""trying to save myself"" refer to emotional coping, not physical self-harm.
   - The primary focus is on emotional suffering and a desire to escape, with ""I want to be saved"" contrasting the stated wish to die but not negating it.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the phrase ""I jsut want to die"" is a direct, personal expression of a desire to die. There is no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No** specific method (e.g., pills, hanging), plan (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""next week""), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., buying means, writing a note) are mentioned. The distress is contextual (family/home situation), but not linked to actionable suicide planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes ongoing distress and a future return to a triggering environment (""gotta return to their house through Jan 19th"") but **no description of past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills last week"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""I jsut want to die"") confirms **suicidal intent**, placing it beyond *Indicator* (which requires no personal desire to die).  
   - Absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No description of past/initiated suicidal actions rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Thus, **Ideation** fits best: clear desire to die without a plan or actionable steps.

354,I don't know what to do. I feel like I'm a fuck up who can never get anything right. I feel like my mom thinks I'm a genuinely stupid human being who can't think for herself. I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree. I want to tell a suicide hotline but I don't want to be locked up in a mental facility and never be able to get out. I don't know what to do.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of worthlessness (""I'm a fuck up,"" ""stupid human being"") and hopelessness. It includes a specific suicidal method: ""driving 100 mph into a tree."" There is emotional distress about being a burden and ambivalence regarding seeking help (wanting to call a suicide hotline but fearing institutionalization). No past actions or preparations (e.g., writing a note, starting to drive) are mentioned. The temporal context is current (""right now""), with no indication of imminent action beyond contemplation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""thinking of driving 100 mph into a tree"" strongly implies a personal desire to die, as it describes a lethal method in a context of despair. While suicide is not explicitly named (e.g., no ""kill myself""), the method is a clear indicator of suicidal intent. The ambivalence about calling a hotline suggests conflict but does not negate the desire to die (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die""). Thus, explicit intent is present.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""driving 100 mph into a tree,"" which is a concrete, potentially lethal means. There are no signs of preparation (e.g., no mention of acting on the thought or acquiring tools), but the presence of a method alone meets the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts (""I'm sitting in my car right now thinking of...""), not past or recent actions. No initiated, potentially lethal actions (e.g., starting to drive) are reported, so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post includes explicit personal suicidal thoughts with a specific method, moving it beyond 'Indicator' (general distress without suicidal desire) or 'Ideation' (desire without a plan/method). The mention of a method (""driving 100 mph into a tree"") aligns with 'Behavior' (desire/thoughts with a plan/method). There is no ambiguity about the method being explicit, so 'Behavior' is chosen over 'Ideation'. No past or current actions warrant 'Attempt'.

We started off a bit complicated, my mum is dying from cancer and at the start I told her that I cant commit to a relationship because I wasn't in the right headspace. That was fine at first but she wanted more and so did i. But I was weak and looked for comfort in an ex. I put a stop to it again and again but everytime something got hard with my family I kept running to the other woman for support. I knew it was wrong and I hated myself so much. I hate myself so much. We were together for two years. But she found out about the previous incident and left. I am fully responsible for everything that happened. Im so regretful and sorry for hurting her. My mum is in her final couple of weeks, im her primary carer and I dont know how to process any of it. She will be leaving my little brother who is autistic in my care. I've struggled with suicide before. I was hospitalised for it previously. I dont see any future ahead for me. I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well. I regret all the pain I ever caused and im so sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicide struggles and hospitalization, indicating a history of suicidal behavior.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""I dont see any future ahead for me"") and guilt/self-hatred.  
   - Explicitly states fear of suicide after mother's death: ""I am so scared that once my mum passes I will be joining her as well"" and ""sorry for all the pain I will cause with my passing.""  
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation described for future suicide (e.g., no tools, locations, or notes).  
   - Describes a past suicide attempt (""hospitalised for it previously"") but focuses on *future* intent.  
   - Desire to die is explicit and personal (""joining her,"" ""my passing"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""joining her [mother]"" and ""pain I will cause with my passing"" directly express a desire to die. No negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to act"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method/preparation** for the future intent. The post references a past attempt (hospitalization) but lacks details about current plans (e.g., how/when/where for the feared future act).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past action: Hospitalization confirms a prior **attempt**.  
   - Current/future: Expresses *fear* of acting (""I will be joining her"") but **no description of recent/initiated action**. The suicidal intent is framed as impending (after mother’s death) but not yet acted upon.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Past hospitalization is an **Attempt**, but the post’s primary focus is on *current/future* suicidal desire without a plan.  
   - Explicit desire to die (""joining her,"" ""my passing"") meets **Ideation**.  
   - No plan/method for future intent → not **Behavior**.  
   - Past attempt is secondary to current ideation; the imminent risk centers on expressed future intent.  
   - **Result**: Strong suicidal desire with no plan → **Ideation**.

356,"My mind is hell. After my breakup 6 months ago, I've been in a mental battle that I am losing. This will probably sound dumb but, you literally cannot get rid of love. Knowing that you still love someone who has already grown distant from you is painful. I've tried everything in my capabilities to get better. Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy. I feel so weak, so hopeless against my head. I don't have much time left before I have to stop it. Nothing makes it go away. There is quite literally nothing there.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""I feel so weak, so hopeless""), anhedonia (""Nothing, nothing changes""), and feelings of being overwhelmed by persistent negative thoughts/dreams.  
   - **No explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, or preparations. The closest phrase is ""I don't have much time left before I have to stop it,"" but ""stop it"" is ambiguous (could refer to the mental anguish, not necessarily suicide).  
   - The writer focuses on emotional pain, regret, and exhaustion (""wake up even more tired of living""), but **lacks any direct reference to suicidal intent, plans, or actions**.  
   - Key themes: despair over a breakup, failed coping strategies, and intrusive thoughts/dreams.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or equivalent.  
   - Desires expressed are about escaping pain (""tired of living"") but **not a stated wish to die**. The phrase ""I have to stop it"" is vague and non-specific.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit or implied desire for death. Leans toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No mention** of methods (pills, weapons), locations, preparations (notes, goodbyes), or timelines for self-harm.  
   - Coping strategies discussed (therapy, medication, hobbies) are non-lethal.  
   - **Conclusion**: Absence of planning elements rules out 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and failed coping efforts over 6 months.  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). The phrase ""I have to stop it"" is future-oriented but lacks specificity.  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence of initiated self-harm. Rules out 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and hopelessness but **lacks personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or actions**.  
   - Ambiguous phrases (""stop it"") are insufficient for 'Ideation' without clearer suicidal intent.  
   - Falls under '**Indicator**' as it primarily signals emotional crisis without suicidal ideation/behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""constantly contemplate suicide"" and ""Would've been better for me to not be here at all.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't know where I want to go""), anhedonia (""I used to love making shit... now exhausted""), feeling trapped (""capitalism... irreparably fucked up my brain""), and existential despair (""live a mediocre existence"").  
   - No specific plans, methods, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - No references to past suicide attempts or actions initiated.  
   - No temporal urgency (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"" for suicide).  
   - The phrase ""contemplate suicide"" indicates thoughts, but no explicit desire to act is stated.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""contemplate suicide"" and ""not be here at all,"" reflecting a passive wish to cease existing.  
   - However, the tone leans toward despair about life circumstances rather than an active, current desire to die. No direct phrases like ""I will kill myself"" or ""I want to die right now.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No mention of a plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means).  
   - ""Contemplate suicide"" implies thoughts, not actionable intent.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Discusses ongoing feelings (""constantly contemplate"") but no past or recent suicidal actions.  
   - Focuses on general despair and historical loss of passion, not concrete actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit suicidal thoughts (""contemplate suicide"") are present, but **no desire to act is stated**, and there is **no plan/method/preparation**.  
   - Falls under **Ideation** (explicit personal thoughts of suicide/desire to not exist) rather than **Behavior** (no plan) or **Attempt** (no action).  
   - Not **Indicator** because suicidal thoughts are explicitly mentioned without negation (e.g., no ""I don’t want these thoughts"").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicide"" directly (""When to know if suicide is better"") and frames it as a potential ""release.""  
   - Expresses severe distress: trauma, OCD, anhedonia, isolation, abuse, hopelessness (""life is a bust"").

   - No references to past actions or attempts (e.g., ""I tried..."").  
   - Asks if others feel ""the release is better,"" indicating contemplation but not a personal declaration of imminent intent.  
   - Describes suicidal ideation as a philosophical question (""is better?"") rather than a current desire to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicide"" but frames it hypothetically (""When to know if..."").  
   - Expresses despair (""life is a bust"") but does not state a direct, personal desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

It references a past suicide attempt with ""attempt properly again,"" implying a concrete action was taken. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""as always""), despair related to Christmas, and loneliness.

   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a personal desire to die through phrases like ""Hopefully I won't wake up tomorrow"" (a common euphemism for death) and references to past suicidal behavior (""attempt properly again""). The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or negate the desire; instead, it conveys genuine suicidal intent, even if passive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations for a current or future suicidal act are mentioned. The reference to ""attempt properly again"" is about a past event and does not detail any plan or means for an imminent action. Future intentions are conditional and lack concrete planning, so this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes both a current/future intention (e.g., the wish not to wake up and the conditional plan to attempt again) and a past event (""attempt properly again""). Crucially, the phrase ""attempt properly again"" confirms a specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action was taken in the past. This past action is clearly described as an ""attempt,"" indicating it was concrete and not just ideation. Even though it is referenced alongside current distress, the past attempt takes precedence for classification.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond 'Indicator' due to explicit personal suicidal desire. It includes 'Ideation' (e.g., the wish to die) but lacks a current plan or method for 'Behavior'. However, the description of a past suicide attempt (""attempt properly again"") is concrete and meets the 'Attempt' definition, which prioritizes such actions even with concurrent ideation. Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit.

364,Can someone harvest my organs?. Hi i am looking for someone to kill me and hide my body so that my family will never find out. I am happy for u to chop me up as long as i never get found again,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions seeking someone to kill the author (""looking for someone to kill me""), hiding/disposing of their body (""hide my body,"" ""chop me up""), and ensuring they are never found.  
   - Emotional indicators include desperation to avoid family awareness, implying shame or perceived burden.  
   - Specific methods are implied (being killed by another person, dismemberment) and preparations are described (hiding the body).  
   - No past actions are mentioned; the focus is on future intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill me"" and contextual desire for death (to never be found) show unambiguous intent to die. No negation of desire.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (hiring someone to kill/dispose of the body) and preparations (hiding the body, dismemberment) are explicitly stated.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""looking for someone""), not a past/initiated action. No evidence of concrete prior attempts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific plan/method (hiring killer, body disposal) = **Behavior**.  
   - Distinction from Ideation: Plan/method is present.  
   - Distinction from Attempt: No initiated lethal action described.

365,"I'm fed up with it. It's now going on 10 years that I've been fighting down suicidal thoughts. Circumstances have changed, I've had great highs and rock bottom lows, but none of it matters. Every fucking day, something just snaps on in my head and then I'm fantasizing about my death. I fight to suppress them; some days are easier than others. Obviously it's manageable, because I'm still here. I have no desire to die. But I'm so fed up with fighting this crap that some days I consider it.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death,"" and a 10-year struggle with these thoughts. It includes emotional distress (""fed up,"" ""fighting down,"" ""rock bottom lows"") and describes an ongoing internal battle to suppress these thoughts. The writer explicitly states, ""I have no desire to die,"" indicating the thoughts are unwanted. There is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). No past or recent suicidal actions are described; the focus is on managing intrusive thoughts over time. The temporal context is chronic (""10 years,"" ""every day""), with no imminent timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""suicidal thoughts,"" ""fantasizing about my death""), but the writer clearly negates any desire to act, stating, ""I have no desire to die."" The suicidal thoughts are framed as unwanted and fought against (""I fight to suppress them""), leaning toward 'Indicator' since the primary sentiment is distress about the thoughts, not a current personal wish to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tools, or preparations are mentioned. The content revolves around thoughts and fantasies without concrete details about carrying out suicide. Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a long-term history of suicidal thoughts but no past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""fighting down"" and ""suppress"" refer to mental management, not physical attempts. There is no description of a potentially lethal action (e.g., taking pills, self-harm), so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states no desire to die, making it distinct from 'Ideation' (which requires a personal desire to die). With no plan or method, it cannot be 'Behavior'. No action was initiated, ruling out 'Attempt'. The distress and unwanted nature of the thoughts align with 'Indicator', especially given the explicit denial of suicidal intent. Per the rules, when suicidal thoughts are present but unwanted and without desire, 'Indicator' is appropriate. Ambiguity would favor 'Indicator', but here the lack of desire is clear.

366,"My problems are getting worse, and I just really wish to end my life, but I just can't. Every day, I'm struggling more and more with my problems. I was emotionally neglected by my parents, and searching for the love and attention I never got is the only thing keeping my alive. Every thing I do is controlled by this. It usually starts by seeing someone getting praised for something, which leads to me thinking that I need to be able to do/ have these things to be loved. Every time I see things as simple as a drawing, just gets me more and more depressed. I can't go to a therapist or something like that, because my mom's mad at me for being even sad in the slightest. I can't talk a single word about mental health at all, without being scared that she will scream at me another time. I feel like I'm unimportant. Other people have problems much worse than mine. They deserve being cared for, unlike me. Hearing other people's problems just makes me feel sad, and envious, because these people are getting all this love that I never got, and I never will get. I just don't have any more options here, than to just end all this. The problem is that I just can't harm myself even in the slightest. I don't know why, but I just. can't.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Explicit desire to die: ""I just really wish to end my life.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't have any more options""), despair (""I feel unimportant""), anhedonia (""everything I do is controlled by this""), and perceived burden (""other people deserve care, unlike me"").
   - No specific method, plan, tools, location, or preparations mentioned (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or timelines).
   - Explicit negation of action: ""I just can't harm myself even in the slightest"" and ""I don't know why, but I just can't.""
   - No past actions described (e.g., no references to prior attempts).
   - Focus on distress about suicidal thoughts without capacity to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes**: Explicitly states ""wish to end my life.""
   - **But** the desire is directly contradicted by statements of inability to act (""I just can't""), framing the thoughts as distressing but not actionable.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **No**: No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations. Only abstract desire (""end all this"") without specifics.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - **No past or recent actions**: Describes ongoing emotional struggles but no initiated suicidal acts (e.g., no ""I tried to..."").

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""wish to end my life""), which exceeds *Indicator*'s scope of abstract distress.
   - However, it lacks any plan/method/preparation, ruling out *Behavior*.
   - No past/current suicidal actions are described, ruling out *Attempt*.
   - The critical factor: The author explicitly negates the ability to act on their desire (""can't harm myself""), framing the suicidal thoughts as unwanted or impossible to execute. This aligns with *Indicator*'s definition of distress about suicidal thoughts without current intent or capacity to act.  
   - *Ideation* requires an active desire without negation; here, the desire is undercut by stated helplessness (""I just can't"").  
   - **Conclusion**: *Indicator* best fits due to the explicit contradiction of intent and absence of actionable intent.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: ""lost control,"" ""want to cry,"" ""can't breathe,"" ""want to scream,"" and explicitly states ""I don't want to live this again.""  
   - **No mentions** of death, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Emotional indicators include desperation (""help please"") and a desire to escape suffering (""I don't want to live this again""), but **no explicit wish to die**.  
   - The phrase ""I don't want to live this again"" focuses on avoiding emotional pain, not ending life.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - The statement ""I don't want to live this again"" implies distress about *circumstances*, not a desire for death. The plea for ""help"" reinforces this as a cry for relief.  
   - **No suicidal thoughts** are mentioned, wanted or unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No references to tools, locations, substances, notes, or timelines.

   - Describes **current emotional state** with no past actions or imminent intentions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows severe distress and a wish to escape suffering but **lacks explicit personal desire to die**, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions.  
   - ""I don't want to live this again"" is ambiguous but aligns with **distress about life circumstances**, not suicidal intent (per rules: ""If in doubt... choose Indicator"").  
   - Fits **Indicator**: Expresses hopelessness without suicidal desire.

My family still thinks and swears my reason to die is only because of the things that have happened with my ex. It's this fucking sickness god it's horrible it's so goddamn horrible and I don't why this is happening to me. Of course I get my ex doesn't care about me and didn't care about all the things she did behind my back. Hell I think that little porn video I found some way she wanted me to find it someday. And I don't blame her I'm pissed off and want to punch the teeth out her mouth but I don't blame her either. To hear that your husband likes to watch little girls in underwear and sexual poses and likes to often dress in drag for god knows maybe why. I understand but she did the things she did before I said this to her. It was actually a few months before she finally told me she was leaving. And I get it even then I get it and maybe not the same way it happened to me but I know this happens to a lot of people both make and female with their SO. But his isn't just my problem my trauma it's this sickness I've been carrying from before I even met her. And I'm tired because I'm a good person I know it's wrong I know that. But I have tried so head to stop it and it just keeps getting worse and to make matters harder my family doesn't listen they just keep naming it on my failed marriage/relationship. I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it. And my mom didn't even tell my brother the whole truth. They can't keep hiding it and brushing it off. It's not helping!,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress, hopelessness (""It's too hard,"" ""this sickness god it's horrible""), and frustration with family misunderstanding.  
   - Explicit suicidal intent is indicated by: ""**I left a note explaining exactly why I decided this is it**."" The phrase ""this is it"" strongly implies a decision to end life, and leaving a note is a recognized suicide preparation.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, weapons) or timeline (e.g., ""tonight"") is mentioned, but the note confirms active preparation.  
   - The author describes their suffering as ongoing (""this sickness I've been carrying"") and emphasizes feeling unheard, but the note signifies a concrete step toward suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes.** ""I decided this is it"" (in context of leaving a note) directly implies a personal desire to die. There is no negation (e.g., ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes.** Leaving a suicide note (""I left a note"") is explicitly stated. This is a documented preparatory behavior per the guidelines.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The note was written in the past, but the post focuses on *current* distress and the note’s existence as part of ongoing suicidal planning. No description of a past *initiated lethal action* (e.g., ""I took pills"") is present.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation:** Explicit desire to die (""this is it"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** The suicide note is a preparation, so 'Behavior' overrides 'Ideation'.  
   - **Behavior vs. Attempt:** No past/initiated lethal action occurred; the note is preparatory, not an attempt.  
   - **Conclusion:** Suicidal desire + preparation (note) = **Behavior**.

It changes you into the kind of idle, infinitely distracted lazy looney you see so much on tv. Nothing can be bothered with anymore unless it's interesting, and almost nothing is interesting unless you're so hyperfixated on it that you can repeat the wikipedia page word by word. I lost my ability to socially relate, be a normal human being, when it happened. Everything they said about me at the time was 100% right. I really did try and look up girls' skirts. They did it in anime, and that was my obsession at the time. I was, and remain, an unstable freak. I was a creep, because that's how I acted. I reread the same books over and over like a madman. No wonder I was bullied so relentlessly. Middle school was the first time in my life I ever screamed that I wanted to die, and it's never been far away from my mind since. I'm thoroughly scared of people. Not in meeting them, but in losing them. My best friend said it best: ""I deal with him."" I alienate everyone. I say weird shit with no context that makes sense only to me. I offend people because I speak without thinking. Mom told me once that when she and dad got a divorce it'd be all my fault, and it was. It's always my fault. The worst part is that I was supposed to have every advantage. White, male, private school, rich parents and a full ride through college. No debt. I blew it. All of it. Got two shitty, worthless degrees, that could bring me zero prospects in life. Was given a job at mommy's office to stay out of trouble, and I was fired for being suicidal at the end of my 90 day trial period. Above all else, I'm lonely. I'm a creep. I long for something, someone, I could never receive on my own merits. Women, more than anything else on earth, terrify me, because I know I'm a short ugly bastard with no prospects and no social skills. I don't deserve anything, much less someone.

Therapy hasn't helped, and medication robs me of the only dopamine infusion my hairy palms can bring. I just. Want. To die. I don't want to be a burden anymore.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions intense hopelessness, despair (""I can't keep doing this anymore""), feeling like a burden (""I don't want to be a burden""), and isolation. 
   - Explicitly states ""I just. Want. To die"" and ""How do I kill myself..."" confirming a personal desire to die. 
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is described, but the question ""How do I kill myself..."" implies seeking/considering methods. 
   - No preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) or past/future actions are mentioned. 
   - Temporal focus is on current suffering and hypothetical future action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases: ""I want to die"" and ""kill myself"" express a clear, personal desire to die. The context shows no negation of this desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - **No explicit plan/method/preparation**. The question ""How do I kill myself..."" indicates contemplation of methods but does not specify a concrete plan, tool, location, or preparatory step. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Describes past suicidal thoughts (""screamed that I wanted to die"" in middle school) but **no past or recent initiated lethal action**. The query about methods is future-oriented and hypothetical.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") and direct suicidal thoughts (""kill myself"") are present, but no specific plan/method (beyond a general question) or preparation is stated. The question about methods shows active consideration but falls short of detailing a plan (e.g., ""I will use X method at Y location""). Without a concrete plan, 'Behavior' is not applicable. Past expressions of ideation do not override current intent, and no actionable attempt is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions hopelessness (""No point in it all,"" ""I don't see a future""), despair (""world is growing dim""), feeling like a burden (""disappointing those who care""), and existential distress (""wasn't meant for this world"").  
   - References to death/escape: ""push me over the edge,"" ""free from it all,"" ""eternal void,"" and rejecting waiting for death ""naturally.""  
   - **No explicit mention of suicide, self-harm, or specific methods** (e.g., pills, hanging). ""Push me over the edge"" is metaphorical; ""eternal void"" is abstract.  
   - **No stated desire to die**: The phrasing focuses on needing a catalyst (""one last push"") for escape, not active suicidal intent.  
   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions** described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or unambiguous desire to die.  
   - Distress about existence is clear, but the desire for death is implied (not explicit). Metaphors like ""free from it all"" lack personal ownership of suicidal intent.  
   - Leans toward **'Indicator'** due to absence of explicit desire and focus on distress/unwanted state.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. ""Push me over the edge"" is vague and not tied to a concrete plan or tool.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Discusses **current/future feelings** (""I need,"" ""I'll be free"").  
   - **No description of past or recent self-initiated lethal actions** (e.g., no mention of prior attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses **distress, hopelessness, and passive thoughts of escape** but lacks:  
     - Explicit desire to die (""Ideation"" requires this).  
     - Plan/method (""Behavior"" requires this).  
     - Description of past actions (""Attempt"" requires this).  
   - Metaphorical language (""push,"" ""void"") and abstract dissatisfaction align with **'Indicator'**, especially given ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire.  
   - Rule: If unsure between Indicator/Ideation due to ambiguity, choose **Indicator**.

371,People who commit suicide are not weak. Most of the time people get to that place because we've bottled everything up and tried to deal with painful emotions by ourselves then one day we just snap and break down.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses suicide in a general, third-person context, focusing on why ""people"" reach the point of suicide (e.g., bottling up emotions, dealing with pain alone, snapping, and breaking down). 
   - There are no mentions of personal death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods/means from the author. 
   - Emotional indicators like hopelessness and despair are present but framed as a collective experience (""we've bottled everything up"") rather than a personal expression. 
   - No specific plans, methods, preparations, or references to past personal actions are described. 
   - There is no imminence (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon"") or stated personal desire to die; instead, the author explains the emotional buildup that leads to suicide in others.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" but only in reference to ""people"" in general, not the author personally (e.g., no phrases like ""I want to kill myself"" or ""I want to die""). 
   - The author does not express a clear personal desire to die or not be alive. The use of ""we"" (""we've bottled everything up"") is inclusive but remains observational and explanatory, not confessional. 
   - There is no mention of personal suicidal thoughts, wanted or unwanted. Thus, this leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned in relation to the author. The discussion is abstract and general. 
   - Without any personal plan or preparation, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a general, timeless process (e.g., ""most of the time,"" ""one day"") and does not reference any past, current, or future personal actions by the author. 
   - There is no description of a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author, so 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content expresses distress and emotional turmoil but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire from the author. It discusses suicide abstractly and attributes it to collective experiences without indicating the author's own intent. 
   - Since there is no explicit personal desire to die (only general statements about others), and ambiguity about suicidal desire for the author, 'Indicator' is appropriate per the rules (e.g., ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator""). 
   - Rules emphasize that classification is based solely on the author, not others mentioned, and here the author does not personally express ideation, behavior, or attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever,"" indicating a direct desire for suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include intense anger (""fuck everyone,"" ""giant middle finger""), resentment, and a sense of finality (""leave this world forever,"" ""I'd be dead"").  
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes) are mentioned.  
   - The language is future-oriented (""If I kill myself,"" ""before I leave"") with no reference to past actions or attempts.  
   - The author expresses a clear wish to die as an act of defiance (""people will know I aint having any of their shit"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and ""leave this world forever"" confirm explicit suicidal intent. The author’s desire to die is unambiguous and not framed as unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: Despite expressing a desire to die, there is no mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a hypothetical future scenario (""If I kill myself"") with no indication of initiated actions (past or recent).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""kill myself"") rules out *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal desire).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: While suicidal intent is clear, the absence of any plan/method/preparation means it does not meet *Behavior* criteria.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated actions (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - **Conclusion**: The post fits **Ideation**—explicit personal desire to die without a specific plan or method.

He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise.

   - **Yes**: The author explicitly states a personal expectation of being ""Dead"" in five years, indicating a desire to not be alive.  
   - No negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: No mention of specific tools, locations, substances, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, or methods). The death reference is abstract (""Dead"") without actionable context.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No**: Describes future hopelessness (""in five years"") but no past or imminent self-harm actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation** fits: The author explicitly expresses a personal desire to be dead (""Dead"") and suicidal thoughts through hopelessness.  
   - **Not Indicator**: The ""Dead"" statement is a current, personal desire to not be alive, moving beyond abstract distress.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No plan, method, preparation, or prior/concrete suicidal action described.

374,⚠️TW⚠️ (I think) Question. If someone wants to kill their self for what ever reason Maybe to end their pain why do people stop them?. (No hate). (Asking for a personal reason),0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill their self"" and ""end their pain,"" which references suicide, but it is framed hypothetically and in the third person (""someone""). There are no emotional indicators like hopelessness or despair from the author themselves. The author asks a question about why people intervene in such cases, indicating abstract discussion rather than personal expression. No specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions are described. The context is general and hypothetical, with no imminence stated. The phrase ""Asking for a personal reason"" suggests possible personal relevance, but it does not explicitly state the author's own desire to die or suicidal thoughts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill their self,"" but it is attributed to ""someone"" (third person), not the author. There is no clear, personal expression of a desire to die from the author (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or equivalent). The author does not state or imply that they personally have suicidal thoughts or a wish to act on them; instead, the focus is on questioning intervention. Therefore, this leans toward 'Indicator' as the suicidal intent is not personal to the author.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, means) is mentioned. The content is entirely hypothetical and lacks any planning element, so it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a hypothetical scenario with no reference to past, current, or future actions initiated by the author. There is no description of a concrete suicidal act (e.g., ""I tried""), so 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post discusses suicide abstractly and questions intervention, but it lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action from the author. The hypothetical framing and third-person language place this in 'Indicator', as per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator."" The mention of suicide is not tied to the author's own intent, and the risk must correspond only to the writer.

375,"I been suicidal since I was since about 10 or 11. So remember when I was 10 or 11 I came home from school just to find out that my teacher called my mom because I failed the spelling bee test, so while I was in my backyard with my narcissistic mom scolded I run to the lake and I thought jumping in and drowning since it was pretty deep and I didn't know how to swim. So some how she convince me not to. Now I'm 16 depressed and waking up everyday faking everything I do and every hour on till I go to sleep suicide by a train is on my mind. I'm planning on doing it on my 18th birthday 🥳. So I was wondering if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions past suicidal thoughts at age 10-11 (considering drowning) but no action taken due to intervention.  
   - Explicitly states being suicidal currently (""suicidal since I was 10,"" ""depressed,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind"").  
   - Describes a specific future plan: ""planning on doing it on my 18th birthday"" using the method ""suicide by a train"" and inquiring about lethality (""if I put neck on the train tracks will it instantly kill me"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Depression, hopelessness (""faking everything""), persistent suicidal ideation.  
   - No description of past or recent initiated lethal action (past incident was interrupted before action).  
   - Desire to die is explicit (""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Phrases like ""suicidal,"" ""suicide by a train is on my mind,"" and planning details confirm a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Specific method**: ""suicide by a train"" and details about placing neck on tracks.  
   - **Preparation/Plan**: Explicit future timing (""on my 18th birthday"") and method research (asking about lethality).  
   - Past incident (drowning consideration) lacks preparation/action and is historical.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past ideation (age 10-11) involved thoughts but no initiated action (interrupted before attempt).  
   - Current content focuses on **future plans** (age 18) with a method, not past/current actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and suicidal intent are present.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: Specific plan (train method, timing), method details, and preparation (researching lethality) exceed mere thoughts.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No description of an initiated, potentially lethal past/recent action (past event was interrupted before action).  
   - **'Behavior'**: Current suicidal desire + specific plan/method (train tracks on 18th birthday) + implicit preparation (researching method efficacy).

I had a few rougher weeks lately and heard that someone who I know tried to end his life. Since then I keep thinking about it. It used to be something that wasn´t that ""real"" something I would think about, but it seemed more unattainable. It´s like knowing someone tried it, opens a window for me that it´s now ok to try. I can´t really explain why I feel like this. But I just don´t want to think like this anymore.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but clarifies they are mostly in the past.  
   - Expresses distress about current thoughts triggered by another person's suicide attempt.  
   - Explicitly states: ""I just don’t want to think like this anymore,"" indicating these thoughts are unwanted.  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past personal actions.  
   - Focus is on intrusive thoughts and distress about their recurrence, not a current desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts.""  
   - However, the writer negates the desire to act (""I don’t want to think like this anymore""), framing the thoughts as distressing but unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations described.  
   - Thoughts are abstractly linked to another person’s attempt but lack personal planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Refers to past thoughts and current distress but describes no personal actions (past or present).  
   - No initiated self-harm or suicide attempts mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly stated as unwanted and distressing, not reflecting a current desire to die.  
   - Lacks plan/method/preparation → rules out *Behavior*.  
   - Lacks initiated action → rules out *Attempt*.  
   - While suicidal thoughts are present, the writer’s explicit rejection of them and absence of desire to die aligns with *Indicator* (distress about thoughts, not intent).

377,"Stop please. I can't even do work, be productive, stay hydrated without having intrusive thoughts CONSTANTLY compulsions, rage outbursts, followed by depressive episodes just want my life to end",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions severe distress: inability to function normally, intrusive thoughts, compulsions, rage outbursts, and depressive episodes.  
   - Key phrase: ""just want my life to end"" expresses a personal desire to cease living.  
   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""can't even do work"") and despair.  
   - No negation of suicidal thoughts (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to die"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself"" are absent, but ""just want my life to end"" directly signals a **current personal desire to die**.  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  
   - **Result**: Explicit desire to die is present → Leans toward *Ideation*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No reference to tools, locations, substances, timelines, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).  
   - **Result**: Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and thoughts, **not** a past or recent concrete action.  
   - No mention of initiated self-harm (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  
   - **Result**: No evidence of an *Attempt*.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: While distress is prominent, the explicit personal desire to die (""want my life to end"") elevates it to *Ideation*. Vague hopelessness alone would be *Indicator*, but here the desire is clear and personal.  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior/Attempt**: No plan, method, or action described → *Ideation* is appropriate.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""nearly killing myself one night,"" indicating a past suicidal action initiated by the author.  
   - Emotional indicators include dissociation, numbness, hopelessness (""i feel so disconnected from life""), and feeling out of control.  
   - Specific methods are referenced (""step off a building or over a bridge"") in a future-context hypothetical.  
   - The author describes a past concrete action (""nearly killing myself""), implying an attempt was initiated but not completed.  
   - No current desire to die is explicitly stated; the future-risk phrasing (""it'll only take one day..."") suggests impulsivity rather than active planning.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""nearly killing myself"" (past action).  
   - No *current* desire to die is expressed; the future hypothetical lacks immediacy or commitment.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (jumping from building/bridge) are mentioned but framed as a passive future possibility (""without thinking""), not an active plan.  
   - No current preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Key element**: ""nearly killing myself one night"" describes a past *initiated, potentially lethal action* (even if interrupted/failed). This qualifies as an attempt under the guidelines.  
   - Future references (""step off a building"") lack specificity or preparation, leaning toward ideation/behavior.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The past action (""nearly killing myself"") is a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal act. This meets the **Attempt** definition.  
   - Current content includes distress (dissociation) and passive risk, but the explicit description of a past attempt takes precedence.  
   - Future references are vague/hypothetical and lack plan/preparation, so they don’t override the past **Attempt**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense distress, hopelessness (""shits not worth it anymore""), feeling like a burden (""all i ever do is disappoint and burden other people""), and a desire to escape (""i need a way out""). It explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""i want to take myself out,"" indicating a personal desire to die. Fear of pain (""i'm scared it'll be painful"") shows ambivalence but does not negate the desire. No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions are described. The post focuses on current emotional pain and a plea for help (""what do i do, please?"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the phrase ""take myself out"" is a direct euphemism for suicide or killing oneself, expressing a clear personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or not acted upon (e.g., no phrase like ""I don't want to die""). The fear of pain indicates hesitation but does not explicitly reject the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun, jumping) is mentioned. ""Take myself out"" is vague and lacks detail about means. No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing a note) are present. The absence of a concrete plan or method means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and thoughts, with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was initiated, stopped, or failed). Phrases like ""i want to"" are future-oriented but not tied to imminent action or a specific timeline.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""i want to take myself out"") rules out 'Indicator', which requires no clear suicidal intent. The lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no description of a past or recent initiated action, 'Attempt' does not apply. The core content—expressing a desire to die without specifics—aligns with 'Ideation'. The fear of pain introduces ambivalence but does not change the category, as the desire is still present and no plan is indicated.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""want to die"" (mentioning death/dying) and expresses hopelessness and disengagement (""Can't be fucked with anything anymore""). There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions. The temporal context is general (e.g., ""the more I live""), with no indication of imminence. The writer's stated desire (""want to die"") appears genuine and personal, with no expression of these thoughts being unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post does not explicitly use words like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but it directly expresses a personal desire to die (""want to die""). There is no indication that this desire is unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""). Thus, there is a clear desire to not be alive.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The content focuses solely on the desire to die without actionable details.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current and ongoing feeling (""the more I live""), not a past event or imminent action. There is no description of any initiated suicidal act (e.g., no reference to trying or attempting something).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""want to die"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguity or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. With no description of past or recent initiated actions, 'Attempt' does not apply. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation', as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without specifics on planning or action.

My grades have dropped and they are furious, calling me a failure and a disappointment. I tried to tell them how I've been feeling, as in feeling like a coward and contemplating but they don't care. All they care about is grades and chores. I'm lazy and useless and since my grades are dropping, I won't make it into college. I'm a burnout, I'm so tired of expectations.

It's not like anyone will care when I'm gone, they'll just have less children to feed, and less bills to pay. I want to die but I'm scared of the consequences of failure.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""contemplating"" (likely meaning contemplating suicide) and explicitly states ""I want to die."" It also describes prolonged distress (6+ months of thinking about dying painlessly) and strong emotional indicators like hopelessness (""no one will care when I'm gone""), feeling like a burden (""less children to feed, less bills to pay""), and despair.
   - There is **no** mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, weapons), plan (e.g., ""tonight I will...""), or preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means). The author only states they are ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" but have not found a way.
   - The author expresses fear of ""consequences of failure,"" indicating ambivalence but no initiated action. No past suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described.
   - Temporal context: The suicidal thoughts are ongoing (""for the past 6+ months"") but lack imminence (e.g., ""today"") or concrete steps.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and references contemplating suicide. The desire to die is personal and current, with no indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don’t want to act on this""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump""), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The author only vaguely references ""thinking on how to die painlessly"" without detailing a plan. This absence of concrete planning/preparation leans toward 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes ongoing thoughts (""thinking for 6+ months"") but no past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to...""). The fear of failure reinforces that no action has been taken. This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die (""I want to die"") and suicidal thoughts, placing this beyond 'Indicator'.
   - The lack of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.
   - No description of a past or recent suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire without a plan aligns with 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses intense anger, hopelessness, and despair (""I hate everything,"" ""My life is ruined,"" ""I've only thought about killing myself for 5 years"").
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""I have emails to send to my parents before I do it"" directly implies planning suicide (""do it"" refers to suicide based on context). 
   - Mentions preparation: Writing emails to parents as a precursor act, with fear of ""wussing out,"" indicating concrete steps.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is named, but ""do it"" contextually means suicide.
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions described (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""I do it"" implies suicide, and ""thought about killing myself"" confirms personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes. Preparing emails (""emails to send to my parents before I do it"") constitutes explicit preparation, aligning with ""writing my suicide note"" in the Behavior definition.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Focuses on current/future intent (""before I do it"") and chronic ideation (5 years). No description of past initiated lethal actions (e.g., attempts).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Suicidal desire is explicit (Ideation threshold met).
   - Preparation (emails) is mentioned, moving beyond mere thoughts to actionable steps (Behavior).
   - No past/current lethal actions (Attempt not applicable).
   - Thus, **Behavior** best fits: Explicit desire + preparation (emails as documented intent).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""Ending it soon"" directly indicates a plan to die by suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators: ""I'm so fucking depressed,"" hopelessness about life circumstances (job loss, fear for mom's health, bad drug experience).  
   - **Specific method/preparation**: Mentions ordering 14 grams of dextromethorphan (DXM) and plans to ingest it all upon delivery. This is a clear method (overdose) and active preparation (acquiring means).  
   - Temporal context: Future action (""soon,"" ""as soon as it gets here""). No past attempts described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Ending it soon"" is an explicit declaration of suicidal intent. No negation of desire (e.g., no ""I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (dextromethorphan overdose) and active preparation (ordered and awaiting delivery).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **future intent** with preparation, but **no past/initiated action** (e.g., no ""I took pills yesterday"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method/preparation = **Behavior**.  
   - Not ""Attempt"" because no concrete action was initiated (e.g., ingestion hasn’t occurred).  
   - Not ""Ideation"" due to presence of plan/method.  
   - Not ""Indicator"" due to explicit personal suicidal desire.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post expresses existential despair and frustration about the length of human life, questioning why people value staying alive. Key elements include:
     - Mentions of life duration: ""I have 60 fucking years left,"" and dissatisfaction with past life: ""I 'really lived' 15 years, and it wasn't really good.""
     - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (e.g., implying life is burdensome and not enjoyable) and despair (e.g., frustration with the prospect of living longer), but no explicit references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, or specific methods.
     - No signs of plans, methods, preparations (e.g., no tools, locations, notes, or timing like ""tonight"").
     - No references to past actions related to suicide or self-harm; only general life experiences are discussed.
     - Imminence: No stated intentions for future actions; the tone is rhetorical and philosophical.
     - Stated desire: The writer questions the value of life but does not express a personal, current desire to die. Instead, it's framed as confusion or distress about the human condition (e.g., ""how people can want to live?"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear desire to die expressed; the post focuses on the difficulty of living long rather than wanting to end life (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, so there is no discussion of them being unwanted or unwanted.
   - Leaning towards 'Indicator' due to lack of explicit suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means).
   - Therefore, no evidence supporting 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes past life experiences as negative but no mention of any concrete suicidal actions (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").
   - Focuses on future life duration in an abstract way, not on imminent or recent actions.
   - No evidence of 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows general distress and hopelessness about life but lacks explicit personal desire to die or suicidal thoughts. It fits 'Indicator' (expresses distress, sadness, or abstract discussion of life/death without current, personal suicidal intent).
   - Ambiguity exists in the despairing tone, but without explicit suicidal desire or plan, 'Indicator' is appropriate per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""
   - Not 'Ideation' because no desire to die is personally expressed; not 'Behavior' or 'Attempt' due to absence of plan, method, or action.

385,"It's never a good idea to threaten to call the cops on someone who's passive suicidal, teetering on the edge of being suicidal. Because they may just think that's their opportunity to suicide by cop, and you've just encouraged them. Why would people be so counterproductive?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses ""passive suicidal"" individuals and the concept of ""suicide by cop"" in a general, hypothetical context. 
   - It mentions suicidal ideation (""teetering on the edge of being suicidal"") and a specific method (""suicide by cop""), but **these are attributed to a generic ""someone""**, not the author. 
   - The author expresses criticism of others' actions (""threaten to call the cops,"" ""counterproductive"") but **shows no personal emotional distress, hopelessness, desire to die, or plans/preparations for self-harm**. 

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit personal desire to die or suicidal intent is expressed by the author. Terms like ""passive suicidal"" and ""suicide by cop"" are used abstractly to discuss others' potential reactions. 

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - While a method (""suicide by cop"") is mentioned, it is **not linked to the author** (e.g., ""I might do this""). No personal plans or preparations are described. 

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post discusses a hypothetical scenario (""they may just think...""). There is **no description of past, current, or imminent actions** initiated by the author. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post focuses on societal commentary about suicide risk in others, not the author's own state. It lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. Mentions of suicide are abstract and cautionary.  
   - **Fits ""Indicator""**: General discussion of suicide without personal desire/intent from the author.

Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life and never told anyone because I hate being a burden. My diabetes diagnosis has gotten me access to insulin pens and I almost went into shock a while back when I was just on the pens. Getting the pens is too much of a hassle though. Doctor mentioned something about getting me a pump if my condition goes south quick and, with 100s of units of insulin at the press of a button, think that might be the way I choose to go. Had a couple ideas for how to do it, but getting a pump if it gets bad might be the easiest and most accessible. Thought about doing it a couple times, but didn't because it was such a hassle to set up.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions having a ""plan in mind"" since learning of potential Type 1 Diabetes diagnosis.
   - Expresses depression, feeling like a burden, and hopelessness (""Pretty sure I've been depressed for most of my life"").
   - Explicitly states suicidal intent: ""think that [insulin pump] might be the way I choose to go.""
   - Specifies a method: Using an insulin pump to self-administer a lethal overdose (""100s of units of insulin at the press of a button"").
   - Notes preparations: Planning to obtain the pump if their condition worsens.
   - References past thoughts (""Thought about doing it a couple times"") but no initiated lethal action—only barriers (hassle) prevented action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**. The phrase ""the way I choose to go"" directly implies a personal desire to die by suicide using the insulin pump.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Yes**. A specific method (insulin overdose via pump) is named, and preparations (planning to acquire the pump for this purpose) are described.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - Describes future intentions (""might be the way I choose to go"") and past thoughts (""Thought about doing it""), but **no initiated lethal action**. Barriers (hassle) stopped prior plans; no attempt occurred.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Suicidal desire is explicit, moving this beyond *Indicator*.
   - A specific method (insulin pump overdose) and preparatory steps (planning to obtain the pump) are stated, qualifying as *Behavior*.
   - No evidence of a past/current initiated lethal action (only ideation/planning), ruling out *Attempt*.
   - *Behavior* fits best due to the presence of both desire and a concrete plan/method.

387,Birthday ☹️. ever wanted to kill yourself on your birthday? well I do and I have a chance right now. nobody told me happy birthday or anything . they just walked past me like I was nothing … it's not even about that im just tired of everything ! Worst birthday ever !,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions ""kill yourself"" and ""kill myself"" (implied in ""I do""), indicating direct references to suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm just tired of everything""), despair (""Worst birthday ever!""), and feelings of being ignored or worthless.
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned. The phrase ""I have a chance right now"" suggests opportunity but lacks explicit details about a plan.
   - No references to past actions; the focus is on current feelings and intentions.
   - Imminence is indicated with ""right now,"" but it describes a potential action, not one that has been initiated.
   - The desire to die is explicit and personal (""well I do""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kill yourself"" and affirms a personal desire with ""well I do.""
   - The desire to die is clear and not negated (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to"").
   - This rules out 'Indicator' and supports 'Ideation' or higher.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. ""I have a chance right now"" implies opportunity but is vague and not tied to a concrete plan.
   - Since there is no explicit plan/method, this leans toward 'Ideation' (per the rule: if unsure, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior').

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""right now"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt being made, stopped, or failed).
   - Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - Explicit desire to die places this above 'Indicator' (which requires no clear personal desire or unwanted thoughts).
   - Lack of specific plan, method, or preparation distinguishes it from 'Behavior' (which requires explicit planning elements).
   - No initiated lethal action distinguishes it from 'Attempt'.
   - Best fit is 'Ideation': explicit personal desire to die without a stated plan or method.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right? So why should I give a shit. Why do I give a shit",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes significant academic stress, feelings of isolation, hopelessness (""I don't want to do this anymore""), and perceived parental pressure.  
   - Explicitly mentions ""finally considering suicide"" after previously never thinking about it.  
   - No specific methods, plans, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are described.  
   - No references to past suicidal actions or attempts.  
   - Emotional indicators include despair, anhedonia (""none of those things help anymore""), and feelings of being overwhelmed.  
   - The writer questions the value of life (""We all die right? So why should I give a shit"") but does not assert a current desire to act.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""considering suicide"" explicitly references suicidal ideation.  
   - **No**: The post does not state a direct desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""). Instead, the focus is on distress and unwanted thoughts (""It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide"").  
   - The writer implies their parents are a protective factor (""I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents""), suggesting ambivalence rather than intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: There is no mention of a method (e.g., pills, jumping), plan (e.g., ""tonight""), or preparation (e.g., writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The suicidal thoughts are described as recent (""finally considering"") but entirely prospective.  
   - **No** description of any initiated self-harm or suicide attempt (past or present).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The explicit mention of ""considering suicide"" moves this beyond vague distress (**Indicator**).  
   - However, the absence of a plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of past/current self-injurious actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - The core is **explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan**, fitting **Ideation**. The writer’s distress about these thoughts and lack of stated intent to act do not negate the presence of active ideation.

Living life as a shell is bullshit but I cant even kill myself. I dont know if this is divine intervention or some shit but it hit me to the core. I was ready. I almost committed. What am I doing.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions ""I just attempted to end my life,"" indicating a recent suicide attempt. It describes self-harm actions: ""my wrists and thighs are bleeding already"" and the use of a knife (""I put down my knife""). Emotional indicators include despair (""Living life as a shell is bullshit"") and frustration at not completing the act (""I'm too much of a pussy even kill myself""). The desire to die is clear (""I was ready to leave everything,"" ""I almost committed""), and the event is described as very recent and imminent (""just attempted,"" ""right there about to do"").
   - Explicit suicide/death intent: Yes, phrases like ""attempted to end my life,"" ""kill myself,"" and ""almost committed"" show a clear, personal desire to die.
   - Plan/method/preparation: A specific method (knife) and preparation/action (bleeding from wrists/thighs) are mentioned, with the action initiated but stopped.
   - Temporal context/action: The post describes a past/recent, specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (cutting with a knife causing bleeding) that was interrupted by the user (""I put down my knife""). This constitutes an attempt, even though it failed.
   - Desire: The user expresses a genuine wish to die but was unable to complete the act, not that the thoughts were unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: Yes, the post contains direct phrases like ""attempted to end my life"" and ""kill myself,"" with a clear desire to die. The frustration about not succeeding doesn't negate the intent; it reinforces the desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: Yes, a specific method (knife) is mentioned, and preparations/actions are evident (bleeding from self-harm, handling the knife). However, since the action was initiated, this moves beyond mere planning or preparation to an actual attempt.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: The action is described as very recent (""just attempted"") and involves a specific, potentially lethal act that was initiated (bleeding indicates physical harm started) but interrupted by the user. This fits the 'Attempt' category, as it was a concrete, self-initiated action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post is not 'Indicator' because it includes explicit personal desire to die and details of an attempt.
   - It is not 'Ideation' because there is more than just thoughts; a method and initiated action are present.
   - It is not 'Behavior' because the user describes a past/recent initiated action (the attempt with the knife causing bleeding), not just planning or preparation. 'Behavior' would apply if there was only mention of a plan without initiation, but here the action was started.
   - 'Attempt' is the best fit because the post centers on a concrete, potentially lethal action that was carried out but not completed, as defined by the category (e.g., ""initiated action... interrupted by self"").

Final decision: The post describes a suicide attempt that was initiated and caused physical harm, making 'Attempt' the appropriate category.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post includes explicit mentions of suicidal desire (""I know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't"") and references to past suicidal thoughts (""I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to""). Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it""), feeling like a burden, and family conflict. There are **no** references to specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past suicidal actions. The author explicitly negates acting on their desire due to lacking ""guts.""

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit mention: ""kill myself"" (Yes).  
   - Clear desire to die: ""I would [kill myself]"" if not for lacking courage (Yes).  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as persistent but explicitly unacted upon due to fear/incapacity, not as unwanted thoughts the author is resisting.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No mention of methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., no pills, notes, or timelines).  
   - Focus is solely on *desire* without actionable steps.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes *persistent desire* to die but explicitly states no past attempts (""never actually attempted"").  
   - No initiated actions (interrupted or otherwise) are described.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** places this above *Indicator* (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - **Absence of plan/method/preparation** rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/ongoing lethal action** rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Core content aligns with **Ideation**: active desire to die with no actionable plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Explicit statements of intent**: ""I'm ending my life tonight,"" ""Killing myself is the only escape.""

   - **Preparation described**: ""I've already written my suicide note and put it on my notes app.""

   - **No past actions described**: References are to *future* plans, not initiated acts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""ending my life,"" ""killing myself,"" and ""suicide note"" confirm a current, personal desire to die. No negation of intent (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

   - **Specific method (scissors) and preparations (note)** push this to **Behavior**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions ""my plan to kill myself,"" indicating a personal expression of suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include frustration and anger about the intervention (e.g., ""snitched,"" ""preventing someone to get euthanized,"" ""what the fuck""), which suggests a genuine desire for death rather than distress about unwanted thoughts. There is no specification of the suicide method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., no details on how or when the plan would be carried out). The focus is on the aftermath of the plan being revealed, with family now monitoring the author. No past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., attempts) are described; the post discusses the plan as a thought or intention that was disclosed.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""plan to kill myself,"" which is a direct expression of suicidal intent. The comparison to euthanasia reinforces a desire to die, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no language like ""but I don't want to act on it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - While a ""plan"" is mentioned, it is vague and lacks any specific details about methods (e.g., no reference to pills, weapons, locations), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or timing. The rules state that if unsure about an explicit plan/method, 'Ideation' should be chosen over 'Behavior'. Here, the mention of a plan is insufficiently detailed to qualify as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post references a past disclosure of the plan by a friend, but the author's suicidal thoughts or plan are presented as current or recent (implied by the family's ongoing monitoring). Crucially, there is no description of a specific, initiated action by the author (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took...""). Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires evidence of a past or recent concrete, potentially lethal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""plan to kill myself""), placing it beyond 'Indicator'. However, the absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' (where such details must be explicit). Since no past or recent suicidal action is described, 'Attempt' is not applicable. Thus, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as it captures the explicit suicidal thoughts and desire without concrete planning elements.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.
   - It expresses a clear desire to die with the phrase ""im gonna kill myself.""
   - A specific timeline is provided: ""3 weeks from now,"" which indicates planning.
   - Preparatory behavior is mentioned: ""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks,"" suggesting social withdrawal as a step toward the act.
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, location) is detailed; ""kill myself"" is vague.
   - The concern for the child (""I hope my baby ends up safe"") implies consideration of consequences but does not describe a past action.
   - The intent is future-oriented, with no mention of past attempts or initiated actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" showing a clear personal desire to die.
   - There is no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or negated; it is presented as an intention.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific timeline (""3 weeks from now"") constitutes part of a plan.
   - Preparatory behavior is evident in the stated social withdrawal (""minimally interact with everyone except the kids for 3 weeks"").
   - However, no explicit method (e.g., means or location) is mentioned, making this aspect less specific.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""im gonna kill myself. 3 weeks from now""), not a past or recent action.
   - No initiated, potentially lethal actions are mentioned, so it does not qualify as an attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die rules out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a timeline and preparatory behavior (social withdrawal) indicates a plan, leaning toward 'Behavior'.
   - Since no specific method is mentioned, there could be ambiguity, but the timeline and behavioral preparation align with 'Behavior' as per the definition (mentions a plan or preparations).
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or initiated action is described.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit due to the combination of suicidal intent, timeline, and preparatory actions.

394,Would this kill me. Midol 3 bottles. Prozac 30 20mg pills. Tylenol bottle. Water bottle full of alcohol,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post directly questions lethality: ""Would this kill me,"" implying consideration of suicide.
   - It lists specific substances and quantities: ""Midol 3 bottles,"" ""Prozac 30 20mg pills,"" ""Tylenol bottle,"" and ""Water bottle full of alcohol,"" indicating a potential overdose method.
   - No explicit emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness) are present, but the focus is on means and lethality.
   - There is no mention of past actions or attempts; the post is speculative and forward-looking.
   - No stated desire to die or not to die; the phrasing is interrogative, not declarative.
   - Imminence is not specified, but the possession of means suggests preparation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""Would this kill me"" is not an explicit statement like ""I want to kill myself,"" but it is personal and contextually implies suicidal intent. It does not express a clear, unambivalent desire to die (e.g., no ""I want to die"").
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted or resisted; the post is neutral and inquiry-based.
   - Since the desire to die is not explicitly affirmed or negated, but the context leans toward consideration of suicide, it is not clearly 'Indicator' and moves toward higher risk.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Specific methods are implied through the detailed list of substances (e.g., overdose via pills and alcohol), and quantities suggest availability.
   - The listing of items (""3 bottles,"" ""30 pills,"" etc.) indicates possession and potential preparation, as these could be means acquired for suicidal behavior.
   - This meets the criteria for 'Behavior' because there is a clear method and preparation element.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I took"" or ""I tried""); it is hypothetical and focused on future possibility.
   - Without any description of an action being taken, this cannot be classified as 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond general distress (which would be 'Indicator') by implying suicidal intent through the lethality question and specific means.
   - It includes a method (overdose with listed substances) and preparation (quantities indicating possession), so it is not 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method).
   - With no action described, it is not 'Attempt'.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the author expresses consideration of suicide with a plan/method and preparations.

395,"How I'm planning to end it. The main reason preventing me from suicide is how it will effect my loved ones. However, recently I've been thinking of doing it in a way that doesn't looks like suicide. Like a car accident or something. I'll get what I want without fucking up anyone's mental health.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and uses phrases like ""end it,"" indicating a direct reference to suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators include concern for loved ones as a barrier, but the core sentiment is a desire to die (""I'll get what I want"").  
   - A specific method is mentioned: ""doing it in a way that doesn't look like suicide,"" with examples like ""a car accident or something."" This shows planning around method concealment.  
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) or past actions are described; the focus is on current thoughts and intentions.  
   - Imminence is not specified (e.g., no ""tonight""), but the planning is recent (""recently I've been thinking"").  
   - The writer expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""get what I want"") and is not framing thoughts as unwanted; the conflict is about impact on others, not resistance to the thoughts themselves.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, ""suicide"" is explicitly mentioned, and phrases like ""end it"" and ""get what I want"" convey a clear personal desire to die. The suicidal thoughts are not stated as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are actively being rationalized.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes, a method is specified: ""car accident or something,"" with intent to disguise it as accidental. This indicates a plan for carrying out suicide, even if vague. No explicit preparations are mentioned, but the method discussion leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes current/future intentions (""planning,"" ""thinking of doing it"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried""). Thus, it does not describe an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses explicit personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires lack of current desire or unwanted thoughts).  
   - A method is mentioned (""car accident or something""), which moves it beyond 'Ideation' (desire without plan/method) to 'Behavior' (desire with plan/method).  
   - No concrete action was taken, so 'Attempt' does not apply. The vague method (""or something"") is still sufficient for 'Behavior' per guidelines, as it explicitly references planning a method.

Any attempts ive made to fix this have failed miserably any jobs I've applied to have failed and none of them are even close to what I was genuinely interested in. What I want to do in life is not realistic and will never happen to me all it has done is waste more money and time and end up making my family more resentful of me the big fuck up of the family.

   - **Absence of suicidal thoughts** (wanted or unwanted). Leans strongly toward 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No mention** of suicide plans, tools, locations, notes, or preparations.  
   - References to ""attempts"" relate to life improvements (jobs, driving lessons), not self-harm.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense sadness (""I feel like shit,"" ""depressed,"" ""fucking sad""), loneliness (""feel a little less alone""), and hopelessness (""pretend that I have a friend"").  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - **No desire to die expressed**; instead, the writer seeks human connection to cope with distress.  
   - Leans heavily toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent.

I reached out for help last night just for someone to talk to aster my dad had just brought up every little thing about myself that I cant stand and made me feel like a completely worthless person as well s the fact that I was just going to be this way forever because I don't even try.

I don't know what to do anymore I'm at the end of my rope and the system in place doesn't work. I am at my wits end, in patient treatment has done me more harm than god and outpatient treatment for the last 20 some years levees me with no results to speak of.

I just don't know what to do anymore because lately it feels like I just can't continue. I think this is my last chance at asking for help because I cant keep going like this.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The author mentions writing a note (""I wrote a note today""), which is a recognized preparation step for suicide.  
   - Emotional indicators are prominent: hopelessness (""light has disappeared""), worthlessness (""made me feel like a completely worthless person""), isolation (""friends I had are long gone""), and despair (""I don't know what to do anymore,"" ""I just can't continue"").  
   - References to seeking help (ER/hospital) indicate distress but no description of self-initiated lethal actions.  
   - Explicitly states escalating risk: ""Even my fear of non-existence after death doesn't seem to deter me anymore"" and ""this is my last chance at asking for help.""  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - Desires are implied through distress (e.g., ""can't keep going"") but lack an unambiguous expression of wanting to die. Leans toward 'Indicator' due to ambiguity.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Key element**: Writing a suicide note (""I wrote a note today"") is a clear preparation step.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, hanging) or timeline mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Hospitalization was due to seeking help, not a self-initiated suicide attempt (""reached out for help last night... end up in the ER"").  
   - No past/current lethal actions described. The note is preparatory but not an initiated attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Preparation (writing a note) is present, but no explicit desire to die or specific plan/method.  
   - Rules state: **""If you are unsure whether there is an explicit plan/method, choose 'Ideation' over 'Behavior'.""** Here, the note alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' without clearer intent.  
   - Dominant themes are hopelessness and distress, not active suicidal desire. Fits 'Indicator' per the rule: **""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""**

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes explicit references to suicide: ""Tried to end my life again"" and ""Didn't work,"" indicating a past action.
   - Emotional indicators are implied through frustration or despair (""Didn't work""), but not explicitly detailed.
   - No specific method, plan, or preparation is mentioned (e.g., how the attempt was made, tools used, or location).
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried"" and ""again"" suggest a concrete action that was initiated but failed.
   - Imminence is not a factor, as the language is past-tense.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die through ""end my life,"" with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or that they resisted the action.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the phrase ""end my life"" is a direct expression of suicidal intent.
   - Yes, the desire to die is clear and personal (""my life"").
   - No indication that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer did not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.
   - The focus is on the action (""tried"") rather than planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a past action: ""tried to end my life again"" and ""didn't work,"" confirming a self-initiated, potentially lethal act that failed.
   - This constitutes a concrete suicidal act (initiated but unsuccessful), not just thoughts or planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - This is not 'Indicator' because there is a clear, personal expression of suicidal intent and action.
   - Not 'Ideation' because the post goes beyond thoughts/desire to describe an actual attempt.
   - Not 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation; the key element is the initiated action.
   - It is 'Attempt' because the post describes a past, self-initiated, potentially lethal action that failed (""didn't work""). According to the rules, even failed or interrupted actions qualify as 'Attempt'.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving. So far I have found relief when I'm outside in extreme cold. Like snow, or just really cold. I take cold showers which make me feel good during but things just come back.",0,indicator,"<thinking>

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post mentions ""suicidal urges"" and ""thinking of killing myself,"" directly referencing suicide.

   - **Plan mentioned**: ""I have a plan but no date set"" confirms a concrete plan exists, even without specifics.

   - Absence of method specifics doesn’t override the explicit plan disclosure.  
   - No initiated actions → rules out ""Attempt.""  
   - Distress/guilt exists but is secondary to active suicidal planning.

I'm not sure if I'm strong enough to get out of this grave I dug myself.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but explicitly states lying about them to avoid stress and therapy complications.  
   - Emotional indicators: Feeling overwhelmed (""therapy tough enough""), hopelessness (""grave I dug myself""), and fear of consequences (""massive issue,"" ""too insistent"").  
   - No mention of death/dying methods, plans, preparations, or timelines.  
   - Focus is on distress about *having* suicidal thoughts and avoiding disclosure, not a desire to act.  
   - ""Grave I dug myself"" is metaphorical, not literal.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicitly mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but **negates desire to act** (lying to avoid consequences, focusing on ""other stuff"").  
   - No expression of a current wish to die; instead, distress about the thoughts themselves.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, locations, or preparations described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions described. Only discusses thoughts and avoidance.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Suicidal thoughts are mentioned but explicitly **unwanted and undisclosed**, with no desire/plan to act.  
   - Primary sentiment is distress about the existence of thoughts, fitting 'Indicator'.  
   - No plan/method ('Behavior') or initiated action ('Attempt'). Ambiguity about desire leans to 'Indicator' per rules.

405,"Anyone agree?. I hate how my ex-friend who bullied me into nearly killing myself/shooting up the school is just gonna live this ✨MagIcAl✨ life and I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away. I fucking hate living, like honestly, what the fuck did I do wrong? Why do the bullies always seem to get away with it?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post mentions past suicidal thoughts and actions with ""nearly killing myself,"" indicating a historical context of being driven to suicide due to bullying. It also references ""shooting up the school,"" which is a violent method, but this is framed as a past near-event.
   - Current emotional indicators include strong despair and hopelessness: ""I'm stuck here feeling like I'm just rotting away,"" ""I fucking hate living,"" and resentment toward the bully. The phrase ""I fucking hate living"" directly expresses a current desire to not be alive.
   - There is no mention of a specific current plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), or preparation (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means) for suicide. The discussion of methods (""killing myself,"" ""shooting up the school"") is entirely in the past context.
   - The temporal focus is mixed: the suicidal references are past (""nearly killing myself""), while the emotional distress (""I fucking hate living"") is current. ""Nearly"" suggests that a concrete action was not initiated or completed in the past, as it implies proximity but not execution.
   - The writer's desire is clear: ""I fucking hate living"" indicates a genuine current wish to not be alive, with no indication that these feelings are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""killing myself"" in a personal context, though it is past-tense. The current phrase ""I fucking hate living"" is a direct expression of a desire to not be alive, which aligns with suicidal ideation.
   - There is no statement indicating that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not desire to act on them (e.g., no qualifiers like ""but I don't want to die""). The sentiment is one of active distress and a wish to escape life.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific current plan, method, or preparation is mentioned. While methods like suicide or school shooting are referenced, they are described as past events (""nearly"") and not current intentions. There is no indication of ongoing planning or preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes past suicidal thoughts and a near-action (""nearly killing myself""), but ""nearly"" indicates that no concrete, potentially lethal action was initiated or completed. This does not meet the threshold for 'Attempt', which requires an initiated action.
   - The current expressions (""I fucking hate living"") reflect ongoing ideation without any described action or imminent plan.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die in the present (""I fucking hate living""), which fits 'Ideation'. There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned for current suicidal actions, ruling out 'Behavior'. The past reference (""nearly killing myself"") describes historical ideation or potential behavior but not an initiated action, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Since there is an explicit current desire to not be alive, it is not 'Indicator', which is for general distress without suicidal intent. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit.

Why can't my brain just recognize like I could've died. I wouldn't have (in my brain) I wanted to. . I held off going to the hospital for as long as I could. I don't remember giving consent to go but my boyfriend said I did. Not that I could consent to anything (obv) idk I'm still processing everything and still feel weird even Calling it an OD.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post describes a past overdose (OD) event involving swallowing 120+ ibuprofen pills and drinking hard liquor.

   - Confirms initiation of a suicidal act (""swallowed 120+ pills,"" ""drank hard liquor"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core of the post is a detailed account of a **past suicide attempt** with a specific method, action, and outcome (""survived"").  
   - While current distress is mentioned (""still processing,"" ""thoughts pop up""), the defining event is the historically initiated, potentially lethal act.  
   - Rules state: ""If a post refers to such past attempts... it should still be labeled 'Attempt'.""  
   - No current plan/preparation overrides this.

   - Explicit desire to die via suicide places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires no personal desire).  
   - Absence of method/plan/preparation rules out *Behavior*.

   - No references to past actions, preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means), or imminent timelines (e.g., ""tonight"").  
   - The author explicitly states fear of acting due to missing potential future improvements, indicating conflict but not a negation of the desire to die.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, the post explicitly states ""i wanna off myself,"" reflecting a clear personal desire to die. The ambivalence (""i'm scared"") doesn't negate this intent; it contextualizes it but doesn't reframe the thoughts as unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method, plan, or preparation** is mentioned. ""Off myself"" is nonspecific and doesn’t imply tools, substances, locations, or steps. Therapy discontinuation is unrelated to suicidal planning.

   - Explicit phrases: ""suicidal thoughts,"" ""I want to give up my life and just die,"" ""I REALLY WANT TO DIE.""  
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die but also ambivalence (""I can't leave my parents""). The suicidal thoughts are described as distressing and consuming (""eating me up""), but **the desire to die is explicitly stated and not negated as unwanted** (e.g., she does not say ""I don’t want these thoughts"").  
   - **Result: Explicit intent is present.**

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:

412,"18(M)I don't know what to type really. I've been cutting my self for a long time I started small and now my body is covered in scars from head to toe. I've been doing that to subvert the pain to a physical one,. I've been feeling numb since I was 12. I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post mentions ""contemplating suicide"" and ""I'm ending it,"" indicating explicit suicidal thoughts and a desire to die.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't get any joy out of life""), numbness, and despair.
   - A specific plan is mentioned: the author agreed to a suicide pact with another person (""we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together""). This implies a joint plan for suicide, though no specific method (e.g., tools, location) is detailed for the author.
   - There is no mention of preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) by the author, nor any description of past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author. The self-harm described (""cutting my self"") is stated as a way to ""subvert the pain"" and is not framed as a suicide attempt.
   - The temporal context is future-oriented and conditional: the author states, ""if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it,"" indicating intent contingent on another person's absence, not immediate imminence (e.g., ""tonight"").
   - The desire to die is genuine and personal, with no indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or distressing in a way that negates intent (e.g., no statements like ""I don't want these thoughts"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" (e.g., ""contemplating suicide,"" ""commit suicide,"" ""kill her self,"" and ""I'm ending it"").
   - Yes, it expresses a clear personal desire to die (e.g., ""I didn't want to live before I met her,"" ""I'm ending it"").
   - The suicidal thoughts are not presented as unwanted; instead, the author endorses them through the pact and personal declaration.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a plan is explicitly mentioned: the suicide pact (""we will do it together""). While no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is detailed for the author, the agreement itself constitutes a plan for carrying out suicide.
   - No preparations (e.g., gathering means) are described for the author.
   - Since a plan is present, this leans toward 'Behavior' rather than 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""I'm ending it"") conditional on another person's absence, but no past or recent suicidal actions by the author are mentioned. The self-harm is ongoing but not suicidal; the other person's attempt is irrelevant to the author's risk.
   - There is no description of a specific, potentially lethal action initiated by the author (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" statement about themselves).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The author expresses a clear desire to die and explicit suicidal thoughts, ruling out 'Indicator'.
   - The presence of a plan (the suicide pact) distinguishes this from 'Ideation' (which requires no plan/method). Although the plan is conditional and lacks method details, it is explicitly stated, so 'Behavior' applies.
   - There is no evidence of a past or recent initiated suicidal action by the author, so 'Attempt' is not relevant.
   - Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post includes both suicidal intent and a mentioned plan.

And everybody keeps telling me to do things I can't do. So I'm fucked.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense grief over a loss (""She's still gone""), hopelessness (""Life isn't worth it without her""), and feelings of being trapped and misunderstood (""I'm alone,"" ""I can't,"" ""I'm fucked""). It directly references suicide with phrases like ""kill yourself"" and ""I need to die,"" rationalizing it as ""perfectly reasonable"" and a solution to pain. Emotional indicators include despair, helplessness, and perceived burden (""People like me are just fundamentally wrong and can't be helped""). However, there is no mention of specific suicide methods (e.g., tools, locations, substances), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or past/future actions taken toward suicide. The focus is on the desire to die as an escape from emotional pain, without concrete plans or timelines.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill yourself"" in a rhetorical context and personally states ""I need to die,"" indicating a clear, current desire to not be alive. The author rationalizes suicide as reasonable and necessary (""better than living in pain""), with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted. Instead, the desire is presented as logical and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The discussion of suicide remains abstract and focused on justification rather than actionable steps (e.g., no references to how, when, or where suicide might occur). Therefore, there is insufficient evidence for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current emotional states and suicidal thoughts, with no references to past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., no descriptions of initiated attempts, interruptions, or failures). The phrase ""I've fucking tried"" refers to efforts to ""move on"" or seek help, not to suicidal behavior. Thus, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit personal desire to die (""I need to die"") places this beyond 'Indicator', which would apply if suicidal thoughts were absent, abstract, or explicitly unwanted. The lack of any plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior', and the absence of described actions rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Ideation' is the best fit, as the post centers on the author's expressed wish to die without concrete suicidal planning or behavior.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post consists entirely of quotes from the author's parents, which include direct commands to die by suicide (e.g., ""take a gun and kill yourself,"" ""shoot yourself already""), mockery of past self-harm/suicide attempts (e.g., ""Did you try to kill yourself again?"", ""cut your wrists again""), and invalidation of the author's mental health.  
   - **Key elements**:  
     - Explicit mentions of suicide methods (gun, shooting, cutting wrists).  
     - References to **past actions** by the author (e.g., vomiting food, self-harm, prior suicide attempts).  
     - No **personal expression** from the author about their *current* suicidal thoughts, desires, plans, or preparations. The author's only direct statement is a question to their dad about why he wanted a daughter.  
     - Emotional indicators (hopelessness, worthlessness) are inferred from parental abuse but not explicitly stated by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author **does not** personally express a desire to die, suicidal thoughts, or intent. All suicidal language comes from the parents' quotes.  
   - The author's sole contribution (""Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter..."") reflects distress but **no suicidal ideation**.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Methods (gun, cutting) are mentioned by parents, but **not by the author**.  
   - **No evidence** of the author discussing plans, preparations, or current methods. References to past actions (e.g., vomiting, self-harm) are historical and not framed as ongoing intentions.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - References to past suicide attempts/self-harm (e.g., ""try to kill yourself **again**"") are **described by parents**, not the author.  
   - The author **does not describe** any past, recent, or imminent self-initiated actions.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post reveals severe distress and abusive dynamics but **lacks personal expressions of suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors from the author**.  
   - Parental quotes about the author's past actions (e.g., ""try to kill yourself again"") suggest historical suicide-related behavior, but the **author does not narrate these events**. Classification focuses solely on the author's own words/intent.  
   - Since the author expresses **distress without personal suicidal intent**, this aligns with **Indicator**.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly asks ""What's the least painful way to kill yourself?"" and demands a ""straight up answer"" about methods.  
   - Emotional indicators include frustration (""I don’t wanna hear all this living’s the least painful way shit"") and implied hopelessness.  
   - The author seeks specific methods (""least painful way""), indicating research/preparation.  
   - No past actions are described; focus is on current intent to find a method.  
   - The phrase ""I just need a way to Kim's"" likely contains a typo (e.g., ""end it"" or similar), reinforcing suicidal intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""kill yourself"" and the demand for methods show a clear, personal desire to die.  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, frustration suggests urgency.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicitly requests information about specific methods (""least painful way to kill yourself""). Researching methods constitutes preparatory behavior.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on *future* intent (seeking methods to act).  
   - **No description** of past/current initiated lethal actions (e.g., no mention of attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (**not 'Indicator'**).  
   - Method/research is mentioned (beyond mere desire → **not 'Ideation'**).  
   - No past/recent lethal action described → **not 'Attempt'**.  
   - Seeking methods qualifies as **preparatory behavior**, fitting **'Behavior'**.

416,I think I'm going to write a suicidal note again. My stomach is literally convulsing from the pain on the inside.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions ""write a suicidal note again"" - indicates preparation for suicide.  
   - Expresses severe emotional/physical distress (""stomach convulsing from the pain on the inside"").  
   - ""Again"" implies a history of similar behavior.  
   - No explicit desire to die (e.g., ""I want to die""), but the act of writing a suicide note inherently implies suicidal intent.  
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or past lethal action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" but ""suicidal note"" explicitly references suicide.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die""), so intent is implied.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Key element:** ""write a suicidal note"" is a clear preparatory act (organizing final thoughts/goodbyes).  
   - No method mentioned, but preparation alone qualifies.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes imminent preparation (""I think I’m going to write"") – future-oriented.  
   - No past/current lethal action (e.g., ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not Indicator:** Explicit suicide-related preparation goes beyond general distress.  
   - **Not Ideation:** Preparation (writing a note) moves it beyond mere desire/thoughts.  
   - **Not Attempt:** No initiated lethal action described.  
   - **Behavior:** Suicidal desire is implied by preparatory act (writing a note), even without a stated method.

417,I will end up committing a massacre. or maybe just slaying myself,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post contains two key elements: ""committing a massacre"" (violence toward others) and ""slaying myself"" (a direct synonym for suicide/killing oneself).  
   - ""Slaying myself"" explicitly references self-inflicted death. The phrasing ""maybe just slaying myself"" implies a personal consideration of suicide as an alternative to violence.  
   - No specific method, plan, preparations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past actions are mentioned. The tone is speculative (""maybe"") rather than decisive.  
   - The author expresses a potential desire to die but does not negate it (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""Slaying myself"" is an explicit, personal reference to suicide (equivalent to ""kill myself"").  
   - **Yes**: The phrase conveys a desire to die (""slaying myself"" implies intent to end life).  
   - **No**: The writer does not state these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No method**: No tools, substances, locations, or specific plans are mentioned (e.g., ""pills,"" ""bridge"").  
   - **No preparation**: No references to notes, goodbyes, or acquiring means.  
   - The vagueness of ""maybe"" and lack of concrete details rules out 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - The post describes a future possibility (""will end up,"" ""maybe"") with no mention of past/current actions.  
   - **No initiated action**: No description of a prior attempt or interrupted act (e.g., ""tried to"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""slaying myself"") confirms this is not 'Indicator' (which requires no genuine suicidal desire).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - **No past/recent lethal action** rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - The core is a stated desire to die without specifics, fitting **'Ideation'**.

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses deep distress about loneliness, lack of motivation (""laziness""), shame over inaction, and feelings of inadequacy. Key elements include:  
   - Mentions ""suicidal ideation"" but explicitly states ""I don’t want to die—I want to live"" and attributes the ideation to shame.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""drowned out by passivity""), self-criticism (""lazy as hell""), and worthlessness (""shame of not being anybody"").  
   - **No references to death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions**.  
   - Temporal context: Focuses on ongoing struggles, not imminent intent.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The phrase ""suicidal ideation"" is used, but **the writer explicitly negates desire to die** (""I don’t want to die—I want to live""). The ideation is framed as unwanted and stemming from shame.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No mention of tools, locations, timelines, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No description of past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, interrupted acts).

   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but **explicitly rejects a desire to die** and lacks any plan/preparation. This aligns with 'Indicator' (distress/unwanted thoughts without genuine suicidal desire).  
   - *Not Ideation*: While ""suicidal ideation"" is mentioned, the context clarifies it is unwanted and disconnected from current intent.  
   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: Absence of plans, methods, or actions.

419,"I wanna get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head. But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?. I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it. And before anybody says anything, no, I'm not calling a suicide hotline. I've heard a lot of people's stories about their shitty experiences with it.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post explicitly mentions a desire to use a specific method for suicide (""get my dad's handgun and shoot myself in the head""). It includes emotional indicators of conflict and hopelessness (hesitation due to fear of disability, rejection of help like not calling a suicide hotline). There is no mention of past actions or attempts, only a hypothetical future scenario. The desire to die is present but tempered by practical concerns about outcomes. No specific timeframe (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide through phrases like ""shoot myself in the head,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die. The hesitation (""I'm hesitant because..."") is based on fear of consequences, not a negation of the desire itself or an expression of unwanted thoughts. Therefore, this does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (shooting with a handgun) and means (dad's handgun) are mentioned. The phrase ""get my dad's handgun"" implies consideration of accessing the tool, but there is no indication of actual preparation (e.g., having acquired it or written a note). Since a method is explicitly stated, this aligns with 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention, not a past or recent action. No initiated, potentially lethal action is mentioned (e.g., no description of having taken pills or attempted to use the gun). Therefore, 'Attempt' does not apply.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die with a specific method (gun), fitting 'Behavior' (suicidal thoughts/desire with a plan or method). The hesitation does not remove the presence of the plan. There is no ambiguity about the method, so 'Ideation' is not appropriate. 'Indicator' is ruled out due to explicit suicidal intent, and 'Attempt' is not applicable as no action was taken.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or explicit desire to die.  
   - Phrases like ""life isn't worth living"" and ""can't see myself having a life worth living"" indicate hopelessness but **lack personal suicidal intent**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post explicitly states ""I think I'm going to kill myself soon"" and ""by February I think I'll be gone,"" indicating a personal desire to die.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""don't see the point anymore"").  
   - A vague timeline is mentioned (""soon,"" ""by February""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, weapons), location, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described.  
   - There is no reference to past suicidal actions or attempts.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, the post directly uses ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear desire to die (""I’ll be gone"").  
   - The author does not negate or express distress about these thoughts as unwanted; instead, they rationalize timing (""wait a bit"" to avoid Christmas).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No specific method or preparation** is mentioned (e.g., tools, substances, locations). The timeline (""by February"") is general and lacks concrete planning details.  
   - Without a method or preparation, this does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - The post describes a **future intention** (""soon,"" ""by February"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - The explicit desire to die (""kill myself,"" ""I’ll be gone"") rules out 'Indicator'.  
   - The absence of a specific method, plan, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No past or recent initiated lethal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.

   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Too many problems"") and self-deprecation (""im a fucked up person"").
   - There is a future intention expressed with a timeframe (""gonna end my life this month""), but no specific method (e.g., pills, gun) or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means) are mentioned.
   - No references to past actions or attempts; the focus is on current feelings and future plans.
   - The stated desire (""I just want to die"") is clear and personal, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions suicide-related phrases (""want to die,"" ""end my life"").
   - Yes, it expresses a clear, personal desire to die (e.g., ""I just want to die"").
   - There is no statement suggesting the thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not wish to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tool, substance, location) is mentioned or implied.
   - No signs of preparation (e.g., writing a note, gathering means) are present.
   - The phrase ""gonna end my life this month"" indicates a general timeframe but lacks concrete details about how or with what means, so it does not constitute an explicit plan for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""this month"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started or completed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear personal desire to die, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - The absence of any specific method, plan, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior' (which requires explicit planning elements).
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so it does not qualify as 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but frames them as part of mental illness and a source of insight (""suicidal thoughts helped me to understand the world"").

   - No mention of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines. 
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions. 
   - Focuses on philosophical/pessimistic views about life and society, with suicidal thoughts presented as unwanted (""mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts"") rather than a current desire to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, ""suicidal thoughts"" is explicitly mentioned. 
   - However, the context shows these thoughts are framed as unwanted symptoms of mental illness (""my mental illnesses and suicidal thoughts"") and are discussed analytically (as tools for ""understanding""). 
   - No clear expression of a *current desire to die* (e.g., ""I want to die"" or similar). The writer distances themselves from acting on these thoughts by contrasting with others (""if you are suicidal and still want kids..."").

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicide (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""If I kill myself"") and expresses hopelessness (""nothings gonna work,"" ""maybe I wasn't cut out for life""). 
   - There is a clear desire to die (""suicide genuinely seems like the only solution,"" ""If I kill myself"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A specific temporal plan (""on my birthday"") and explicit preparation (""plenty of time to plan it out"") are mentioned. Though no method (e.g., pills, jumping) is specified, the clear timeframe and stated intent to plan constitute preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""It'll be on my birthday"") with preparatory steps. No past or recent initiated lethal actions are mentioned.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die (suicide as ""only solution"") places this beyond 'Indicator'. 
   - The mention of a specific timeframe (""on my birthday"") and active planning (""plenty of time to plan it out"") constitutes preparation, elevating it from 'Ideation' (desire without plan) to 'Behavior'. 
   - No concrete past/current action qualifies it as 'Attempt'.

   - Unwanted thoughts? **No** indication the thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no ""but I won’t do it"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - Method: **None** specified (e.g., no pills, weapons, locations).  
   - Preparation: **None** described (e.g., no note, acquiring means).  
   - → Leans toward **Ideation** (desire present, but no plan/preparation).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **current thoughts** (""been thinking of ending it all"") but **no past/current actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").  
   - Focus is on emotional state and ideation, not initiated behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""ending it all"") → Rules out *Indicator*.  
   - **No plan, method, or preparation** mentioned → Rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No description of past/recent suicidal actions** → Rules out *Attempt*.  
   - Clear personal expression of suicidal thoughts without actionable details → **Ideation**.

426,"I want to do this once and for all. I want to get it over with. I'll most likely attempt this weekend. It's probably best if I get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents. I feel kind of sorry for my mom though, her dad died a few days ago and now my death will be following very soon too. I hope she learns to cope well",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""I want to do this once and for all,"" ""I want to get it over with,"" ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend,"" and ""my death will be following very soon too,"" indicating a personal desire to die and a specific timeframe (""this weekend""). It mentions preparation: ""get a will in place to ensure all of my money/assets go to my parents."" Emotional indicators include guilt or concern for the mother (""I feel kind of sorry for my mom""), but the primary focus is on the author's own suicidal intent. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) is mentioned, and there are no references to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I want to get it over with"" and ""my death will be following very soon,"" which, in context, convey a genuine wish to end life. The word ""attempt"" in ""I'll most likely attempt this weekend"" strongly implies suicidal intent. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or distressing without desire to act; instead, the author appears resolved.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (e.g., tools, substances) is not mentioned, but there is clear preparation: ""get a will in place"" is an explicit step to handle affairs before death, which qualifies as preparation. This aligns with the 'Behavior' category, as preparations are a key element. The lack of a method is noted, but the preparation is sufficient to lean away from 'Ideation'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a future intention (""this weekend"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. Phrases like ""I'll most likely attempt"" refer to a plan, not an action that has already occurred. Since no concrete, self-initiated action (e.g., ""I tried last night"") is described, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows explicit personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). The presence of preparation (getting a will) distinguishes it from 'Ideation' (which is for thoughts/desire without plan or preparation). Since no past or recent initiated action is described, it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts/desire combined with preparations.

427,"I don't want to. The final test that will decide whether or not I'll live till October is coming up. But for the first time i don't wanna die, it's not like i wanna live either but i have stuff to do and I'm in the middle of making plans to move and i don't want to waste money to then die right after. But i really cannot live if i fail. The right time is gone, i have no access to my meds, no place to jump from and the blades i used to cut won't go that deep. It's like for the first time in my life I'm almost happy, I'm almost enjoying doing stuff for my new room and I'll have more space to put all the projects i have in mind, I'm having millions thoughts of stuff i wanna do (probably just mania acting up), it's like i have a purpose or something. I'm in a decent place right now and i want to keep doing things. I don't know how much I'll have to wait before i finally get some antidepressants but I'm feeling better nonetheless and i don't even know how I'll do it",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions death/suicide: References a ""final test"" that will ""decide whether or not I'll live till October,"" explicitly tying failure to suicide. Discusses methods (""no place to jump from,"" ""blades... won't go that deep"") and barriers to acting (e.g., logistical/financial concerns).
   - Emotional indicators: Expresses hopelessness (""cannot live if I fail""), ambivalence about living/dying (""not like I wanna live either""), but also notes improved mood (""almost happy,"" ""decent place,"" ""purpose"").
   - Plan/method: Explicitly references suicide methods (jumping, cutting with blades) and evaluates their feasibility (access to meds, location for jumping, blade depth). No active preparation described beyond ideation tied to the test outcome.
   - Past actions: Mentions past self-harm (""blades I used to cut""), but no description of a past suicide attempt. Focus is on future intent contingent on failing the test.
   - Imminence: Suicide is framed as conditional on failing an upcoming test (""will decide whether I'll live till October"").
   - Desire: Explicitly states ""I don't wanna die"" currently due to positive factors, but maintains a conditional desire to die if the test is failed (""cannot live if I fail"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - **Yes.** The post directly links failing the test to suicide (""decide whether or not I'll live,"" ""cannot live if I fail""). The writer personally expresses a desire to die under specific future conditions.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - **Yes.** Specific methods (jumping, cutting with blades) are mentioned. The writer evaluates their current access/viability (""no place to jump,"" ""blades won't go that deep,"" ""no access to my meds""). This constitutes identification of potential methods for a future plan.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The suicidal thoughts and conditional plan are future-oriented (dependent on test failure). Past self-harm (""used to cut"") is mentioned, but it is described as non-lethal (""won't go that deep"") and not framed as a suicide attempt. **No initiated, potentially lethal suicide action** is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - **Not Indicator:** Explicit personal desire to die under specific conditions is present, moving beyond distress/unwanted thoughts.
   - **Not Attempt:** No description of a past or recent initiated lethal action. Past self-harm is not equated to a suicide attempt.
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior:** There is a clear desire to die if the test fails *and* specific methods (jumping, cutting) are identified and evaluated. The mention of barriers (no place, shallow blades, no meds) confirms the writer is considering concrete methods. This satisfies the criteria for **Behavior** (suicidal ideation with a specific plan/method).

428,"I feel as if all I've done through school and my other trials all just go to support the things I hate and that we're only seen as special if people need or want something from us. School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses feelings of hopelessness, despair, and being drained by school, work, and family pressures. Phrases like ""drained me the fuck out of all my motivation,"" ""taken my will to strive,"" and ""I don't know what to do anymore with my life"" indicate emotional distress. There are mentions of feeling useless, trapped in a system, and lacking purpose. However, there are no references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, specific methods, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The focus is on existential frustration and emotional exhaustion, not on ending life.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases.
   - No clear expression of a desire to die or not be alive (e.g., no statements like ""I want to die"" or ""I wish I wasn't here""). The distress is about life circumstances (e.g., ""I don't know what to do anymore""), not a personal wish for death.
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not mentioned at all, the question of them being unwanted doesn't apply.
   - Leaning toward 'Indicator' due to the absence of suicidal intent and the focus on general distress.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation (e.g., pills, notes, goodbyes) is mentioned or implied.
   - Without any plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current feelings and frustrations (e.g., present-tense statements like ""I feel"" and ""I don't see a point""), with no reference to past or recent suicidal actions. There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal self-harm event (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took"" statements related to suicide).
   - This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows distress (hopelessness, despair) but lacks a personal expression of desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plan, method, or past action. This aligns with 'Indicator', which includes general distress without explicit suicidal intent.
   - It does not meet 'Ideation' because there is no explicit desire to die or suicidal thoughts. The ambiguity in phrases like ""I don't know what to do anymore"" is not sufficient for 'Ideation' and should default to 'Indicator' per the rules.
   - 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are not applicable due to the absence of plans, methods, or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""My existence has been nothing but depression, fear, regret and worthlessness""), self-loathing (""I'm such a fucking dumbass""), and perceived burdensomeness (""net gain for the world if i die"").  
   - **Explicit Suicide/Death Mentions**: Directly states ""kill myself by slitting my wrist and bleeding out, shoot myself with a gun"" and ""start cutting myself"".  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Despair (""I'm just waiting for the end""), isolation (""die alone and cold""), and fear (""I want help so badly. But im afraid"").  
   - **Plan/Method/Preparation**: Specific methods (slitting wrists, gunshot) and contextual preparation (waiting to ""get a place,"" isolation to avoid discovery).  
   - **Temporal Context**: Future intention (""Once I get a place... I'll finally be able to do what I want to do"") with no description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **Desire vs. Distress**: Explicit desire to die (""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"") outweighs mentions of fear or wanting help.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Explicit phrases include ""kill myself,"" ""shoot myself,"" and ""die alone and cold.""  
   - **Desire to Die**: Clear statements (""I'm ready to slip into unconsciousness and die"").  
   - **Unwanted Thoughts?**: Though the author expresses fear and a wish for help, the overwhelming narrative is a *genuine desire to die*, not rejection of suicidal thoughts.  

3. **PLAN/METHOD/PREPARATION**:  
   - **Specific Methods**: Lists multiple methods (slitting wrists, gunshot) and implies access/isolation (""if im far enough away"").  
   - **Preparation**: References logistical planning (waiting for a place, ensuring isolation).  
   - **Leans to 'Behavior'**: Methods are concrete, and contextual preparations are noted.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **Future Intention**: Plans are conditional (""Once I get a place"") with no description of past/initiated actions.  
   - **No Initiated Action**: No mention of past attempts or interrupted actions; focus is on future intent.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Not 'Indicator'**: Explicit personal desire to die and specific methods rule this out.  
   - **Not 'Ideation'**: While suicidal desire is present, the detailed methods/preparation exceed ideation.  
   - **Not 'Attempt'**: No past/recent initiated lethal actions described.  
   - **Behavior**: Matches due to **explicit desire to die + specific methods (slitting wrists, gun) + contextual preparations (isolation, waiting for a place)**.

   - Mentions relationship betrayal (""this girl is literally playing the fuck out of me""), self-doubt (""am I just paranoid?""), and existential crises (""what if this really is the world we live in?"").  
   - **No explicit references** to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide. The focus is on emotional pain and a plea for truth/validation (""SOMEONE TELL ME THE DAMN TRUTH"").

   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or expressions of a desire to die.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles. Not for a lack of understanding on their part but for my inability to accurately articulate my situation.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit statements: ""I wanna kill myself,"" ""I want to die,"" ""contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that.""  
   - Specific methods/preparations: Detailed calculations for isopropyl alcohol ingestion, testing noose attachment points, timing for jumping in front of a car (ruled out), and planning to avoid detection.  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""nothing works anymore""), self-hatred (""I hate myself""), worthlessness (""I'm not worth their time""), guilt, and burden.  
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing ideation (""years"") and current contemplation (""Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide"") but explicitly states no action taken (""I don't do it"").  
   - Desire vs. action: Expresses persistent desire to die but refrains due to self-punishment (""I must remain and suffer"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""I wanna kill myself"" and ""I want to die"" indicate a personal desire to die. Unwanted thoughts are not emphasized; instead, the desire is affirmed.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (isopropyl alcohol, hanging, car collision) and active preparations (calculating dosages, testing noose points, timing routines) are described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No initiated actions: Mentions planning and contemplation but explicitly states no execution (""I don't do it""). Past actions (e.g., testing) are preparatory, not suicidal acts.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Behavior**: The post confirms a desire to die (Ideation) **and** details concrete plans/methods/preparations (e.g., isopropyl dosage, noose testing). Crucially, no past/recent lethal actions are described—only planning. The self-stated inaction (""I don't do it"") rules out Attempt.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post contains explicit phrases like ""kill myself"" and expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""i've wanted to do this for over a decade,"" ""i'm not cut out for life"").  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""i can't even imagine mine being worth living""), self-loathing (""selfish and weak""), and rejection of intervention (""not interested in anti suicide discourse"").  
   - A timeframe is implied (""the day i chose is very soon""), but **no specific method, tools, location, or preparations** (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - References to contacting loved ones (grandparents, friends, brother) reflect concern about causing pain, not preparatory actions.  
   - No past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**. Direct phrases like ""kill myself"" and declarations of a decade-long desire to die confirm personal suicidal intent. The rejection of ""anti suicide discourse"" reinforces genuine desire, not distress about unwanted thoughts.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **No**. While ""the day i chose is very soon"" suggests intent, it lacks specificity. No method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are mentioned. The contemplation of contacting family/friends is framed as emotional conflict, not a preparatory step.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Focuses on **future intention** (""soon"") but describes **no past/recent actions**. Urges to contact loved ones are unresolved thoughts, not initiated behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Ideation** fits: Explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts are present, but no plan, method, or preparations are specified. The vague timeframe (""soon"") alone is insufficient for 'Behavior' without concrete planning elements. Absence of past/ongoing actions rules out 'Attempt'. Distress is coupled with active suicidal desire, ruling out 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses long-term emotional pain (""been in pain for over 5 years""), hopelessness (""cba anymore""), and explicitly mentions being suicidal (""most suicidal I've been in a couple months"").  
   - It directly states a desire to escape suffering (""I Just want to be out of my misery"").  
   - No specific suicide method, plan, location, or preparation (e.g., acquiring tools, writing notes) is mentioned.  
   - Withdrawal (""Not going to contact anyone"") suggests isolation but does not indicate concrete suicidal actions.  
   - No past or recent suicidal acts (e.g., attempts) are described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Phrases like ""most suicidal"" and ""want to be out of my misery"" explicitly convey a current personal desire to die/escape suffering. There is no negation of this desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: No method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. Withdrawal from social contact is a risk factor but not a specific plan for suicide.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **current** suicidal intensity but **no past/ongoing actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""want to be out of my misery"") and suicidal thoughts (""most suicidal"") place this beyond *Indicator*.  
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out *Behavior*.  
   - No described initiated actions (past/recent) rule out *Attempt*.  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets criteria for *Ideation* (explicit desire to die/suicidal thoughts without plan or action).

1. CONTENT ANALYSIS: The post contains explicit phrases like ""I just want to die"" and ""I just want to kill myself,"" indicating a personal desire to die. It expresses frustration (""Why is it so hard to die"") and mentions considering methods (""can't find a suitable way to go""), but no specific method, plan, preparation, or past action is described. The focus is on current suicidal thoughts and the challenge of acting on them.
2. EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT: Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""die"" and ""kill myself,"" expressing a clear, personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated.
3. PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION: No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The phrase ""can't find a suitable way"" implies the author is thinking about methods but does not specify or commit to one, so there is no explicit plan.
4. TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT: The post describes current thoughts and desires, with no reference to past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt).
5. CATEGORY REASONING: The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator'. The absence of a specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet 'Behavior' criteria. With no mention of past or initiated actions, it cannot be 'Attempt'. Therefore, it fits 'Ideation' as it involves personal expressions of suicidal thoughts without a plan.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses emotional distress (""low point,"" ""zero social skills/low self-esteem/lonely"") and feelings of inadequacy.  
   - The author seeks practical advice about moving countries and learning a language, indicating future-oriented thinking.  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""is it worth...?"") but **no expressions of being a burden or wanting to die**.  
   - Focus is on life dissatisfaction and seeking solutions (""need help,"" ""ADVICE"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - **No implied desire to die** (e.g., ""wish I wasn’t here""). The closest is ""I wish I had them in the first place,"" referring to social skills, not existence.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, wanted or unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Absent**. The post discusses life decisions (moving countries/language barriers), not self-harm plans, tools, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - **No reference** to past/current actions related to self-harm. The content is future-focused (""Is it worth moving...?"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The core sentiment is **distress about life circumstances** (loneliness, low self-esteem) and uncertainty about the future.  
   - **No desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions** are expressed. The plea for ""help"" and ""ADVICE"" signals reaching out, not isolation.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'**: General distress without personal suicidal intent.

   - No specific plans, methods, or preparations for suicide by the author.

   - No imminence of personal suicidal intent; the ""ASAP"" refers to the wish for another's death.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**

   - Fits 'Indicator' as it expresses distress without current personal suicidal intent. The mention of death is directed at another person and not indicative of the author's own risk.

437,"I will kill my bullie. Hello guys, for type of suicide is characteristically to not kill  only yourself, but others.

I tried every possible thing to make her stop, but she is the most jealous person I have ever met in my life, so I will kill her, to finally live my life in peace. Do you guys have any suggestion of how to murder her?",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post primarily focuses on **homicidal ideation** (""I will kill her,"" ""how to murder her"") targeting a bully.  
   - Mentions ""suicide"" only in an abstract, theoretical context (""type of suicide is characteristically to not kill only yourself, but others""), not as a personal desire or plan.  
   - No explicit personal expression of wanting to die or end one's own life. Instead, the goal is to ""live my life in peace"" by killing another person.  
   - No references to self-harm methods, suicide plans/preparations, or past suicidal actions by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No**. The author never states a desire to die, commit suicide, or be dead. The phrase ""suicide"" is used hypothetically to describe killing others, not themselves.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No suicidal plan/method**. The author discusses plans/methods for *homicide* (""how to murder her""), not self-harm.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past or imminent suicidal actions by the author. Only past efforts to stop bullying (non-violent).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses severe distress and violent intent toward others but **lacks any personal desire, plan, or action related to suicide**. Abstract mentions of suicide do not reflect the author’s current state.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: The core issue is homicidal ideation driven by distress, with no evidence of suicidal intent from the author.

438,I'm on the verge of suicide. 19F I seriously cannot do this anymore. My mental health really bad and the stress of college is making. Honestly the stress might kill me before I even kill myself. I'm such a disappointment and failure and I just want to end it all and I know exactly what to do.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Explicit mentions of suicide: ""on the verge of suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""end it all.""  
   - Emotional indicators: ""mental health really bad,"" ""disappointment and failure,"" hopelessness (""cannot do this anymore"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes: ""I know exactly what to do"" strongly implies a specific plan or method exists, even if not detailed.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future intent (""on the verge,"" ""want to end it all"").  
   - No mention of past initiated actions (e.g., attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + implied plan (""know exactly what to do"") = **Behavior**.  
   - Not *Indicator* (desire is explicit and personal).  
   - Not *Ideation* (plan is implied; ""know exactly what to do"" signals preparation).  
   - Not *Attempt* (no past/recent lethal action described).

   - No references to past actions or attempts are present.
   - No temporal indicators (e.g., ""tonight,"" ""soon"") suggest imminence.
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die without indicating that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill me"" and ""wanna die,"" which are direct expressions of a desire for death.
   - The writer clearly states a personal wish to die (""I just wanna die""), with no negation or indication of distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**

   - There is no description of any initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a clear, personal desire to die, meeting the criteria for 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts or wish to not be alive).
   - It does not qualify as 'Indicator' because the suicidal intent is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.
   - It does not meet 'Behavior' because there is no mention of a plan, method, or preparation.
   - It does not meet 'Attempt' because no concrete, initiated action is described.
   - Based on the rules, when no plan/method is present and desire is explicit, the category is 'Ideation'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
    - The post expresses intense emotional distress, including feelings of depression, hopelessness, loneliness, and rejection. The author pleads for relief from being gay, gender dysphoria, depression, and ""negative thoughts.""
    - There are **no explicit mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). 
    - The author focuses on a desire to be ""normal"" and for divine intervention to remove their struggles (""take all thoughts away,"" ""do a miracle,"" ""take all gayness away""). 
    - The distress stems from identity conflict and past trauma (molestation, upbringing), but **no suicidal intent is expressed**. Phrases like ""tired of being unhappy"" or ""tired of being depressed"" convey emotional exhaustion, not a wish to die.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
    - **No**. The post contains **no direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" ""want to die,"" or similar. The plea is for transformation (""make me straight,"" ""make me normal"") and relief from suffering, not an end to life. The request to ""take all thoughts away"" refers to unwanted identity-related thoughts, not suicidal ideation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**: 
    - **No specific plan, method, or preparation** is mentioned. The author appeals to a higher power for help but describes no concrete actions or means for self-harm.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**: 
    - The post describes **past experiences** (molestation, upbringing) and **current emotional distress**, but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, aborted actions) are referenced.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
    - The core of the post is **distress about identity, trauma, and depression** without expressions of a desire to die or suicidal intent. 
    - The plea to remove ""thoughts"" explicitly targets unwanted feelings of being gay and gender dysphoria—not suicidal ideation. 
    - The absence of any suicidal desire, plan, method, or past attempt places this firmly in **Indicator**. While the emotional weight is severe, it lacks the explicit suicidal elements required for Ideation or higher categories.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post discusses chronic knee pain lasting 8 months with no improvement, expressing frustration and hopelessness (e.g., ""no change in sight""). 
   - It mentions ""suicidal"" in a question: ""Anyone suicidal from knee pain?"" – this is not a personal statement of suicidal intent but a general inquiry about others' experiences. 
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide by the author. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness about the pain but no direct expression of a desire to die. 
   - The author's focus is on the distress from physical pain, not on personal suicidal thoughts or actions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - The post does not explicitly state ""I want to die,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases from the author's perspective. The word ""suicidal"" is used in a question about others, not as a personal admission. 
   - There is no clear desire to die expressed by the author; instead, it reflects distress about the pain. 
   - Since suicidal thoughts are not personally claimed and the context is a general question, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - No specific suicide plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparations (e.g., notes, goodbyes) are mentioned. The content is solely about the knee pain experience.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes ongoing pain over 8 months but no past or recent suicidal actions by the author. There is no reference to initiated self-harm or attempts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal expression of suicidal desire, plan, or action. The mention of ""suicidal"" is abstract and not self-referential, fitting the 'Indicator' category (distress without current personal suicidal intent). 
   - There is no evidence for 'Ideation' (no personal desire to die), 'Behavior' (no plan/method), or 'Attempt' (no initiated action).

I felt like they abandoned me when my mental health was at a low point. Getting into a relationship with somebody that didn't really care about them ruined me when I needed them at my time of need.

After covid, all the other shite that's happened this year too. I'm over life. One last record for me to make and its finally over.

Somebody I loved very dearly took their own life and it gives me comfort we may see each other again. The only person who truly understands the pain I'm feeling",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense emotional distress: hopelessness (""Everything feels like a road filled with pain to a nothingness""), isolation (""I feel alone""), guilt, and trauma from abandonment.  
   - Explicit suicidal desire: ""I am looking forward to finally being able to give in to the nothingness that is death.""  
   - References death as a desired escape (""give in to the nothingness"") and finds comfort in reuniting with a deceased loved one who died by suicide.  
   - No mention of a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, or preparations (e.g., note, acquiring means).  
   - The phrase ""One last record for me to make and its finally over"" implies intent but lacks concrete details about timing/method.  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. Directly states desire to ""give in to [...] death"" and anticipates relief from guilt.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While ""one last record"" hints at a final act, no specific suicide plan, method, location, or preparation is described.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intent (""finally over,"" ""looking forward"") but **no past or recent self-initiated lethal actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die qualifies it beyond **Indicator** (which requires no genuine suicidal desire).  
   - Absence of method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No description of concrete past actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Falls under **Ideation**: clear wish to die (""give in to death"") without a stated plan/method.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense anger towards the mother and explicitly states: ""**I want to die** so she can feel pain and hurt.""  
   - **Emotional indicators**: Anger, desire for retaliation, and explicit wish to die to cause pain.  
   - **Explicit suicide intent**: ""I want to die"" directly expresses a personal desire to end life.  
   - **Plan/method**: Mentions ""wherever it is"" (vague location) but **no specific method, tools, preparations, or timeline** (e.g., no pills, weapons, notes, or imminent timing like ""tonight"").  
   - **Past actions**: None described.  
   - **Desire**: The author actively wants to die (""I want to die"") as a means to inflict pain, with no indication the thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I want to die"" is a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire. The motive (hurting the mother) doesn’t negate the intent.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No**: ""Not sure how much but wherever it is"" implies uncertainty about method/location. No specifics (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes **future intention** (""it’ll be worth it"") but **no past or recent initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried"" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator vs. Ideation**: Explicit desire to die (""I want to die"") rules out 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal intent).  
   - **Ideation vs. Behavior**: No plan/method/preparation is specified (only a vague ""wherever it is""), so it doesn’t meet 'Behavior' criteria.  
   - **Attempt**: No description of past/current concrete actions.  
   - **Conclusion**: Suicidal desire is explicit and personal, but the absence of a plan/method/preparation places this in '**Ideation**'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions of death/suicide: Explicit references to ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""having access to a gun,"" ""dead by the end of the week,"" and ""I just want my death to come faster.""
   - Emotional indicators: Strong hopelessness (""I can't do anything right,"" ""useless,"" ""nuisance""), worthlessness, and isolation (""drive my friends away"").
   - Specific methods/preparations: ""Started to try and starve myself"" (active preparation/initiated action), ""hanging myself,"" and ""gun"" (methods). Includes comparison of methods (slower vs. quicker) and timeline (""dead by the end of the week"").
   - Stated desire: Explicit wish to die (""I just want my death to come faster"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - **Yes**, phrases like ""starve myself,"" ""hanging myself,"" ""want my death to come faster,"" and ""dead by the end of the week"" show a clear, personal desire to die. No negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - **Yes**, specific methods (starvation, hanging, gun) are mentioned. Preparation is confirmed by ""I've started to try and starve myself"" (initiated action). A timeline is provided (""dead by the end of the week"").

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes a **current/future intention** (""if I keep starving myself"") and **initiated action** (""started to try and starve myself""). Starvation is an ongoing, potentially lethal act. No past *completed* attempt is described (e.g., ""I took pills but survived""), so this is not an 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Suicidal **desire** is explicit (Ideation/Behavior).  
   - **Plan/method/preparation is present**: Multiple methods (starvation as active behavior, hanging, gun) and timeline. ""Started to try and starve myself"" confirms preparation/initiated self-harm with suicidal intent.  
   - Rules: Active self-harm (starvation) with suicidal intent and planning is 'Behavior'. Not 'Attempt' because the action (starvation) is ongoing but not described as a past lethal event with outcome (e.g., hospitalization).  
   - **Conclusion**: 'Behavior' (suicidal intent + specific method/preparation).

My life has already been over for six years now, and I'm so tired of going through the motions. I need to catch a break so fucking bad. Why can't I feel anything anymore? I want to cry all the time, but I can't, and I'm not really close enough to anyone to express myself and be understood. Though, it's not like I understand how I feel well enough to explain it anyways. If I had to try, I'd say; There's just this bottomless pit inside of me, somewhere just behind my eyes. Nothing interests me anymore, nothing has any real meaning. I'm so angry all the time. I don't understand why I can't overcome these old injuries. Nerve damage is so horrible. Everything I ever wanted to be was taken from me. I'm aware of an intense level of grief, rage, and bitterness somewhere in my psyche, but it's like it's on the other side of a smokey mirror.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases include ""I plan my suicide"" and ""I just don’t want to go on anymore."" The desire to die is unambiguous and personal.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - **Yes**: Specific methods (pistol, escape bag, self-immolation via gasoline) are explicitly mentioned. The phrase ""I plan my suicide every single day"" confirms ongoing preparation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""I plan..."") and hypothetical actions. No past or recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., attempts) are reported—only planning.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die + specific methods/preparations rule out 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'.

   - **Desire**: Explicit wish to die (""I can't go on like this,"" ""just do it"") but frustration over inability to act (""I fail,"" ""can't pull myself together"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I've been suicidale all my life,"" ""just do it,"" and descriptions of past attempts confirm a persistent desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **Yes**: Specific method (rope) and preparation (standing on a chair) are explicitly mentioned in a recent/relevant context.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - **Past attempts**: Cutting wrists (age 11), laying on a road (age 19), jumping in front of a train (age 24).  
   - **Recent initiated action**: ""I just stood on a chair with a rope around my neck"" describes a concrete, potentially lethal act initiated today but stopped. This qualifies as an interrupted attempt.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The recent action (standing on a chair with a rope) is a **specific, self-initiated, potentially lethal act** that was interrupted (due to thoughts of their friend).  
   - This meets the 'Attempt' definition: a recent, initiated action, even if stopped or failed.  
   - Past attempts reinforce this, but the **recent action takes precedence** for classification.  
   - Rules: 'Attempt' supersedes other categories when a concrete past/recent action is described.

447,"Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die. As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier. I just feel like it's not worth pushing my life further than it needs to be. Especially when I see that the future is really grim.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions death in a resigned manner (""if I die then I die"", ""accept when my time has come"", ""die at 50 or earlier""), but explicitly denies any plans to end life. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""it's not worth pushing my life further"", ""the future is really grim"") and anhedonia. There is no mention of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, or preparations. The behavior described—stopping doctor visits—is framed as acceptance of natural death, not an active suicidal act. Imminence is not indicated; it's a general resignation. The writer's stated desire is not to cause death but to accept it passively, with explicit negation of suicidal plans.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The question ""Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?"" is hypothetical and not a personal expression of intent. The writer expresses a passive acceptance of death (""if I die then I die"") but not a genuine desire to die, especially with the qualifier ""I don't have any plans to end it."" Suicidal thoughts are not personally claimed; instead, the distress centers on hopelessness about life. This leans strongly toward 'Indicator' due to the lack of personal desire to die and the explicit negation of intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide method, tool, substance, or location is mentioned or implied. Stopping doctor visits is a form of self-neglect but not a plan or preparation for suicide; it is described as accepting natural death. With no plan or method indicated, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior.'

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references a past action (stopping doctor visits) but clarifies it is not a suicidal act—it is about health neglect and acceptance of death. No initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action (e.g., an overdose) is described. The context is ongoing resignation without imminent risk. 'Attempt' does not apply, as there is no description of a concrete suicidal action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses distress (hopelessness, grim future outlook) and abstract discussion of death but lacks a personal, current desire to die or explicit suicidal intent. The explicit statement of no plans to end life and the passive nature of the death acceptance align with 'Indicator.' There is ambiguity about suicidal desire, but the rules specify choosing 'Indicator' in such cases. 'Ideation' is not met, as there is no expression of wanting to die or commit suicide. 'Behavior' and 'Attempt' are ruled out due to the absence of plans, methods, preparations, or initiated actions.

I'm too much of a coward to kill myself, too depressed to have actual friends, to ugly to have a significant other, and too lazy and my thyroid is too fucked up to make losing weight an option unless I starve myself or something",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" but negates action with ""too much of a coward to.""
   - Expresses self-hatred, depression, hopelessness (""hate myself,"" ""too depressed,"" ""too ugly,"" ""too lazy"").
   - References ""starve myself"" in the context of weight loss struggles, not as a suicide method/preparation.
   - No specific suicide plan, method, tools, location, or preparations described.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions indicated (e.g., ""tried,"" ""took pills"").
   - Temporal context: Describes ongoing feelings, not imminent intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, explicitly mentions ""kill myself.""
   - However, the phrase ""too much of a coward to kill myself"" explicitly negates the desire/ability to act, framing suicidal thoughts as unwanted/distressing.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific suicide method, plan, or preparation mentioned. ""Starve myself"" is tied to weight loss frustration, not suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted actions).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Suicidal thought (""kill myself"") is explicitly rejected by the author, indicating distress about the thought rather than a current desire to die.
   - No plan, method, or preparation for suicide is present.
   - ""Starve myself"" lacks suicidal context and is not a stated plan/method.
   - Falls under 'Indicator' due to expressed distress and explicit negation of intent to act on suicidal thoughts.

449,"The simplest ways to help a friend who is struggling are often the most forgotten. A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post discusses helping a friend who is ""struggling and thinking about suicide.""  
   - Key elements focus on general advice (e.g., hugs, support) for assisting others, not the author's personal state.  
   - No mentions of death, suicide, self-harm, or methods by the **author themselves**.  
   - No emotional indicators (e.g., hopelessness, burden) from the author.  
   - No plans, methods, preparations, or references to past actions by the author.  
   - The phrase ""thinking about suicide"" refers to a hypothetical friend, not the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - The author does **not** express personal suicidal thoughts, desire to die, or phrases like ""I want to die.""  
   - Suicide is discussed abstractly (as a friend's experience), with no personalization or desire stated by the author.  
   - **Conclusion**: No explicit personal intent → leans 'Indicator'.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No plan, method, or preparation is mentioned for the **author**.  
   - References to suicide are external (advice for others).  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence for 'Behavior'.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - No description of past/current suicidal actions by the author.  
   - The post is purely advisory.  
   - **Conclusion**: No evidence for 'Attempt'.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post expresses distress about others' struggles and discusses suicide abstractly but **lacks any personal desire, plan, or action** from the author.  
   - Suicidal references are detached (third-person), and the author focuses on support strategies.  
   - Fits 'Indicator': General discussion of suicide without personal intent.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this. I just have no one.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses profound hopelessness (""waste of life,"" ""no reason to live,"" ""time to die""), isolation, and despair.  
   - Explicit suicidal intent: ""suicide is their life's purpose,"" ""I am finally becoming content with that,"" and ""driving me further to killing myself.""  
   - Mentions self-destructive behaviors (quitting medication, heavy drinking) but **no specific suicide method, plan, tools, or preparations** (e.g., no pills/weapons/locations tied to suicide).  
   - Fear of hospitalization is noted, but this reflects avoidance of intervention, not a plan.  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions initiated by the author.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**. The author directly states acceptance of suicide as their ""life's purpose"" and links their actions (lying to avoid commitment) to increased risk of ""killing myself.""  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**. While medication discontinuation and drinking are risks, they are framed as coping mechanisms or consequences of distress, not as tools for a suicide plan. No specific method (e.g., overdose, hanging) or preparation (e.g., note, acquiring means) is mentioned.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing despair and suicidal thoughts but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to overdose last night"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Indicator** is ruled out due to explicit personal desire to die.  
   - **Behavior** is ruled out: No plan/method/preparation is specified (e.g., vague ""going off the deep end"" isn’t a plan).  
   - **Attempt** is ruled out: No initiated lethal actions described.  
   - **Ideation** fits: Clear desire to die (""suicide is their life's purpose"") and explicit suicidal thoughts (""killing myself"") without a stated plan or method.

451,"Is drowning yourself painful?. As the title says. I think its the best option for me, its basically a guaranteed death is it not? Sounds rather peaceful actually, slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean as you see a light at the end of the tunnel. A nice smooth transition to death. If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post discusses drowning as a method of suicide, with phrases like ""drowning yourself,"" ""guaranteed death,"" and ""slowly sinking to the bottom of the ocean."" It explicitly considers this method as ""the best option"" and describes it positively (""peaceful,"" ""nice smooth transition to death"").
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness, as the author links the action to a potential trigger (getting kicked out of their house), indicating despair about their situation.
   - A specific method (drowning in the ocean) is mentioned, and there is a conditional plan: ""If I get kicked out of my house, I think I might go and do that."" This shows preparation in the form of identifying a trigger for action.
   - No past actions are described; the content is focused on future intentions under specific conditions.
   - The imminence is conditional (dependent on being kicked out), not immediate.
   - The author expresses a genuine desire for death, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions self-harm through drowning, which is a direct reference to suicide. Phrases like ""drowning yourself"" and ""guaranteed death"" convey a clear personal desire to die.
   - There is no statement negating this desire (e.g., no expression of not wanting these thoughts).

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A specific method (drowning in the ocean) is mentioned and discussed in detail.
   - The conditional statement (""If I get kicked out... I think I might go and do that"") implies preparation by linking the method to a real-life trigger, indicating planning.
   - This presence of a method and conditional plan leans toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention, not a past event. There is no mention of any initiated action, such as an actual attempt or preparation steps like acquiring means. It is hypothetical and conditional.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content expresses a personal desire to die, ruling out 'Indicator' (which requires no clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - The mention of a specific method (drowning) and a conditional plan moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which is for desire without plan/method).
   - There is no description of a past or recent initiated action, so 'Attempt' does not apply.
   - Therefore, with a method and implied plan, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as per the definition: explicit suicidal thoughts with a plan or method mentioned.

I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate?

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - **Key Elements**: The post expresses profound hopelessness (""Is life actually worth living anymore?"", ""I don't see what there is to live for""), despair (""I just feel like I am ‘existing'""), and anhedonia (""I can hardly function anymore""). It explicitly mentions suicide (""suicide is appropriate now?"", ""Death seems a better option"") and a desire to escape (""I want out""). The author frames suicide as a rational response to their circumstances but does **not** describe a specific plan, method (e.g., pills, jumping), or preparation (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). No past suicidal actions are mentioned.  
   - **Emotional Indicators**: Strong hopelessness (""it has all been for nothing""), feeling trapped (""oppressive, boring and dystopian world""), and worthlessness (""Do I really deserve to live"").  
   - **Desire vs. Unwanted Thoughts**: The author explicitly states a desire to die (e.g., ""Death seems a better option,"" ""I want out"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**, direct phrases include: ""suicide is appropriate now?"", ""Death seems a better option,"" and ""I want out."" The author personally endorses suicide as a solution.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations** are mentioned. The post focuses on ideological justification for suicide (""Why even bother?"") but lacks concrete planning.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTIONS**:  
   - Describes **current despair and future-oriented hopelessness** but **no past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., no mention of attempts, aborted actions, or preparatory steps).

   - **Explicit desire to die** places this beyond *Indicator* (which requires absence of personal suicidal desire).  
   - **No plan/method/preparation** rules out *Behavior*.

I need to know what happens,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating references to suicide. However, these are framed in a context of postponement due to a positive reason (Star Wars content). Emotional indicators include a shift from potential despair to hope, with phrases like ""a reason not to kill myself,"" ""it's all I've ever wanted in life,"" and ""I need to know what happens."" The tone is positive (emoticons like "":)"" and ""lol""), suggesting relief and a desire to live. No specific methods, plans, preparations, or locations for suicide are mentioned. The ""suicide attempts"" reference is future-oriented and hypothetical (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade""), not describing a past or imminent action. The writer explicitly states a lack of current desire to act due to their newfound reason to live.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide attempts,"" indicating suicidal thoughts.
   - However, the desire to die is negated and unwanted in the present context. The writer says Star Wars is ""a reason not to kill myself"" and that it will ""postpone any suicide attempts,"" showing distress about suicidal thoughts but no current personal desire to die. The emphasis is on staying alive to experience future events.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, or preparation (e.g., note-writing, acquiring means) is mentioned. The reference to ""suicide attempts"" is vague and future-oriented, with no details on how or when it might happen. Since there is no indication of a plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future intentions (""postpone any suicide attempts for the next decade or so"") but does not describe any past or recent initiated actions by the writer. There is no mention of a concrete, potentially lethal action that was attempted, stopped, or failed. The focus is on preventing future actions, not recounting past ones.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they are unwanted and not acted upon due to a positive reason, aligning with 'Indicator' (distress about suicidal thoughts without current personal desire to die).
   - It does not fit 'Ideation' because, while suicidal thoughts are present, the writer negates the desire to die, making the primary sentiment one of distress rather than intent.
   - No plan, method, or preparation is indicated, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal action is described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - Given the ambiguity, the rule for 'Indicator' applies: if suicidal thoughts are mentioned but clearly unwanted and without current desire, or if in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation', choose 'Indicator'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: The post expresses intense hopelessness (""no will to live,"" ""tired and beaten""), despair (""shitty everything""), worthlessness (""worthless loser""), and explicitly states ""I just want to end it all."" There is no mention of specific suicide methods, tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., pills, notes). No past actions or attempts are described. The temporal context is present/future-oriented (""trudge on,"" ""tired of living like this every day""). The desire to die is explicit and personal.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrases: ""end it all"" (colloquial for suicide) and ""no will to live"" indicate a clear desire to die.  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no statement like ""but I don’t want to act on it"").  
   → **Yes**, explicit intent is present.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes current/future despair but **no past or recent concrete actions** (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"").

Things cod be alright in one aspect ofy life but not without something new tearing me apart.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes key phrases indicating emotional distress: ""Feel like dying again,"" ""endless misery of depression,"" ""back to feeling like shit,"" ""stress me out even more,"" ""Just kill me,"" and ""There's no end to anything."" These suggest hopelessness, despair, and a burden mindset.
   - Mentions of death/dying: ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" imply a personal desire related to death, but there are no specific references to suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., tools, locations, notes), or past actions like attempts.
   - Imminence: No time-bound indicators (e.g., ""tonight"" or ""soon""); the focus is on current feelings and a cyclical pattern of mood (""again"").
   - Desire assessment: The writer expresses a wish to die (e.g., ""Just kill me""), but there is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no phrases like ""I don't want to act on this"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not use direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself,"" but ""Feel like dying again"" and ""Just kill me"" convey a clear personal desire to not be alive, rooted in despair. This aligns with explicit suicidal ideation.
   - There is no negation of the desire (e.g., no indication that the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer doesn't intend to act), so it does not lean toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), location, or preparation (e.g., writing a note) is mentioned. The references to dying are general and lack concrete planning elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and a recurring pattern (""again"") but no past or recent suicidal actions. Phrases like ""Feel like dying again"" refer to emotional states, not initiated behaviors (e.g., no mention of an actual attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit expressions of a desire to die (""Feel like dying again,"" ""Just kill me"") without any plan, method, or preparation place this in 'Ideation'. 
   - It is not 'Indicator' because the writer personally expresses a desire to die, not just distress or unwanted thoughts. 
   - It is not 'Behavior' due to the absence of any plan/method. 
   - It is not 'Attempt' because no past or recent suicidal actions are described.

457,My landlord called for the smell of a Dead Body. My landlord is clearly trying to get me out of my apartment. My neighbors have been purposely keeping me awake. I've probably slept an hour every night for I dont even know how many nights anymore. The landlord had one of em call or the landlord himself called and reported the dead body smell. No smell was found by the cops. I'm so tired. My heads messing with me. I just wanna leave this place. I got diagnosed with MS recently it's hard to deal. I just know I'm gonna be wakened if I fall asleep. It never fails. I cant take this torture from these people. I want to leave. I have no money to just walk out or i would. I dont know what options I have left. I'm really starting to think this is hell and everyone is in on it but me. Just here to suffer while everyone secretly laughs,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions severe distress: extreme sleep deprivation (1 hour/night), paranoia (""everyone is in on it""), feeling tortured, recent MS diagnosis, helplessness (""no money to leave""), and hopelessness (""this is hell"").  
   - **No explicit references to death, suicide, self-harm, or methods**. Desires center on escaping circumstances (""I just wanna leave this place,"" ""I want to leave"").  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no options left""), persecution (""everyone secretly laughs""), exhaustion (""I'm so tired"").  
   - **No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions** related to self-harm/suicide.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No direct phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - Desires focus on escaping suffering (""leave this place""), **not ending life**.  
   - **No suicidal thoughts expressed**, unwanted or otherwise.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**. No mention of tools, locations, notes, or suicide-related preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes ongoing distress and paranoia but **no past/current self-harm actions**.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Expresses intense distress, hopelessness, and paranoia but **lacks personal desire to die, suicidal intent, plans, or actions**.  
   - Closest to **Indicator**: Distress about external circumstances (harassment, illness) without suicidal ideation.

458,"My parents don't love me. I have nobody :). Possible suicide date is in July. Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends. I'll never be a real woman. I don't know why I cling onto ""hope"". I don't even know who I am anymore if I'm being honest.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""Possible suicide date is in July,"" which explicitly references suicide and implies a future plan. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""My parents don't love me. I have nobody,"" ""I'll never be a real woman,"" ""I don't know why I cling onto 'hope'"") and identity confusion (""I don't even know who I am anymore""). The phrase ""Too bad I'm fucking debating it because of my friends"" shows ambivalence about acting on suicidal thoughts, indicating conflict but not a clear rejection of the desire to die. No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or concrete preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are mentioned. There are no references to past actions or attempts. The temporal context is future-oriented (""in July""), not imminent or past.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in ""Possible suicide date is in July."" It expresses a personal desire related to suicide, as the author is actively ""debating it,"" which implies consideration of suicidal thoughts. There is no explicit statement that these thoughts are unwanted or that the author does not desire to die (e.g., no phrasing like ""but I don't want to act on it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - The mention of a ""possible suicide date"" suggests a temporal plan element, but it is tentative (due to ""possible"" and ""debating it""). No specific method (e.g., tools, substances) or concrete preparations are described. Since the plan is not explicit or definite, and no method is indicated, this leans toward 'Ideation' based on the rule to choose 'Ideation' if unsure about the presence of a clear plan/method.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post focuses on future intentions (""in July"") with no description of past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt). The author is debating the action due to friends, but no concrete steps have been taken.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit mention of suicide and personal debate about it indicates a desire to die, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no clear suicidal intent). However, the lack of a specific method or concrete preparation means it does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior' (which requires a plan, method, or preparation). The tentative nature of the date and absence of action rules out 'Attempt'. Therefore, the post best fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts with desire but no definitive plan or method.

It hurts so much but unfortunately I will probably never kill myself because I am a very religious person and for me that would be a big sin so I can only hope that my life will get better,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" triggered by seeing happy people.  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""always be a loser,"" ""never make friends"") and distress (""It hurts so much"").  
   - Explicitly states **no intent to act** due to religious beliefs (""I will probably never kill myself,"" ""big sin"").  
   - Ends with hope for improvement (""can only hope that my life will get better"").  
   - No plan, method, preparation, or past action described.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Mentions ""suicidal thoughts"" but **explicitly negates desire/action**: ""I will probably never kill myself.""  
   - Suicidal thoughts are framed as *unwanted* (religious conflict).  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No method, tools, locations, or preparations mentioned.  
   - All suicidal references are hypothetical and explicitly rejected.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes recurring thoughts but **no past/current action**.  
   - Future intent is explicitly denied.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Suicidal thoughts are present but explicitly stated as *unwanted* and not acted upon.  
   - Primary sentiment is distress about thoughts, not genuine desire to die.  
   - Fits **'Indicator'** per rules: Unwanted thoughts without desire/intent to act; ambiguity leans to Indicator.

I have one person left in the world and she's someone who i only met this april and lives across the atlantic. No one from my real life, no classmates or family, none of them. just some random woman who lives on an entire different continent. I'm thinking of ending it all on new year's eve. I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one. this year has been such a beautiful downward spiral it would be an amazing way to end it, no?. i'm just so tired of failing everyone in my life. i can't fucking do another year.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""thinking of ending it all on new year's eve"" (explicit suicidal intent).  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""tired of failing everyone,"" ""can't do another year"").  
   - References specific **preparations**: ""I've made 3 other suicide notes this year, but this is the one.""  
   - States a **timeframe** (""new year's eve"") but no specific method (e.g., pills, hanging).  
   - No description of past *initiated actions* (e.g., ""I took pills but survived"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""I'm thinking of ending it all"" confirms a current personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Preparation**: Creation of multiple suicide notes (past) and designation of ""this is the one"" (current).  
   - **Time-specific plan**: ""on new year's eve.""  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., tools/location), but **preparations (notes) are explicitly mentioned**.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes **past preparations** (notes) and **future intent** (acting on NYE).  
   - **No initiated lethal action** described (e.g., ""I tried to overdose""). Notes are preparatory, not an action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die + specific timeframe (NYE) + concrete preparations (suicide notes) = **Behavior**.  
   - Notes are clear preparations per the definition (""writing my suicide note"").  
   - Past notes alone would not qualify, but combined with **current intent and timeframe**, they indicate active planning.  
   - No mention of a past *initiated lethal action*, so not 'Attempt'.

461,How do I tell my best friend that I tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown. I've never done it or wanted to do it before but I was having a very bad night and I was kind of drunk and wanted to feel something real.,3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The key elements include a mention of self-harm: ""tried to cut myself last night during a breakdown."" This is a specific past action initiated by the author. 
   - Emotional indicators: ""breakdown,"" ""very bad night,"" ""kind of drunk,"" and ""wanted to feel something real"" suggest distress and emotional pain, but not explicitly hopelessness or despair related to suicide. 
   - No explicit mentions of death, dying, suicide, or self-harm with suicidal intent. The focus is on self-harm as a coping mechanism (""wanted to feel something real""). 
   - The action is described as impulsive, occurring ""last night"" (past), with no indication of planning, method (beyond cutting, which is not specified as lethal or suicidal), or preparation. 
   - The author states they ""never wanted to do it before,"" implying no prior desire for self-harm or suicide, and emphasizes the incident was situational (due to being drunk and having a bad night).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - No explicit mention of ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar phrases. 
   - No clear desire to die expressed; instead, the self-harm is framed as a way to ""feel something real,"" indicating distress rather than a wish to end life. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not mentioned, and the self-harm is not linked to suicidal intent. 
   - Therefore, no explicit suicide/death intent is present, leaning toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - A method (""cut myself"") is mentioned, but it is in the context of self-harm without suicidal intent, as per the author's description. 
   - No signs of planning or preparation (e.g., no note, no acquisition of means for suicide). 
   - Since there is no suicidal desire expressed, this does not qualify for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a past event: ""tried to cut myself last night."" 
   - A specific action was initiated (""tried""), but it is not clearly described as potentially lethal or suicidal. The context suggests it was non-suicidal self-injury (to cope with distress). 
   - No evidence of a concrete suicidal act (e.g., no intent to die, and cutting is not inherently lethal in this description). 
   - Therefore, this does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt', which requires a potentially lethal action with suicidal intent.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The post expresses general distress and a self-harm incident but lacks a personal expression of desire to die or suicidal intent. 
   - Self-harm is present, but it is explicitly described as unwanted and situational (""never done it or wanted to do it before""), with no suicidal ideation. 
   - This fits 'Indicator', which covers distress and self-harm without explicit suicidal desire. 
   - Not 'Ideation' because no desire to die is expressed. Not 'Behavior' because no suicidal plan/method is indicated. Not 'Attempt' because the past action was not described as suicidal or potentially lethal in intent. 
   - Ambiguity about suicidal desire resolves to 'Indicator' per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Explicit mention of suicide: ""plan to kill myself.""
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""no purpose to live""), despair (""nothing and no one""), self-blame (""toxic"").
   - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations described (e.g., no pills, weapon, note-writing).
   - No past actions initiated (e.g., no ""tried"" or ""attempted"").
   - Temporal context: Future intention (""plan to""), no immediacy like ""tonight.""  
   - Desire: Explicit personal wish to die (""plan to kill myself,"" ""no purpose to live"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes, direct phrase: ""plan to kill myself.""  
   - Yes, clear desire to die: ""no purpose to live.""  
   - Suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted/distressing; they reflect active intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - ""Plan to kill myself"" implies intent but lacks specificity. No method (e.g., pills, hanging), tools, or preparations (e.g., note, acquired means) are mentioned.  
   - Vague ""plan"" without actionable details does not meet the threshold for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future intention (""plan to""), not a past/recent initiated action.  
   - No mention of concrete past attempts (e.g., ""I tried"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""plan to kill myself"") and hopelessness confirm **Ideation**.  
   - Absence of specific method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'.  
   - No past/recent initiated lethal action rules out 'Attempt'.  
   - Emotional distress is present but secondary to explicit suicidal intent, ruling out 'Indicator'.

Just wondering if it'd make the process, for them, easier to have a heads up or if it's gotta hit all the same however it goes down?",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""killing yourself soon"" and discusses the logistics of informing others about the act.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Nobodyll do shit"") and resignation (""I have no worries of being stopped"").  
   - No specific method, tools, location, or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned.  
   - The focus is on future timing (""soon"") and hypothetical impact on others, not past actions.  
   - The writer expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""killing yourself soon"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Direct phrases like ""killing yourself"" and ""it'd make the process... easier"" confirm personal suicidal intent.  
   - **Yes**: The author’s tone implies a genuine wish to die (dismissing intervention, planning impact on others).  
   - No negation of desire (e.g., no ""but I don’t want to"") is present.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No**: While timing (""soon"") is implied, no specific method (e.g., pills, jumping) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes) are described. The discussion about ""heads up"" relates to communication, not suicide execution.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes future intention (""will be killing myself soon""), not past/recent actions.  
   - No initiated or interrupted lethal actions (e.g., no ""I tried but stopped"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** places this above *Indicator* (which requires absence of personal intent).  
   - **No method/plan/preparation** rules out *Behavior*.  
   - **No past/recent concrete lethal action** rules out *Attempt*.  
   - The post fits *Ideation*: explicit personal desire to die (""killing yourself soon"") without actionable details.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide: ""I think I'll kill myself tonight"" and ""I want to kill myself so bad."" 
   - Emotional indicators of despair and hopelessness are present: ""I'm so fucking tired of everything.""
   - A specific plan, method, and location are mentioned: ""hang myself at the woods,"" with the addition of a preparatory action (""I'll play my favorite music ever"").
   - The temporal context is imminent: ""tonight"" indicates the plan is for the very near future.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses phrases like ""kill myself"" and expresses a genuine desire to die (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so bad""). There is no statement suggesting the thoughts are unwanted or that the writer does not intend to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""hang myself"") and a location (""at the woods""). The reference to playing music (""play my favorite music ever"") can be interpreted as part of the preparation or ritual for the act, indicating planning.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""tonight"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. It focuses on plans, not on actions that have already been taken or attempted.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire (e.g., ""I want to kill myself so bad"") and a specific plan/method (hanging in the woods) rules out 'Indicator' and 'Ideation'. 
   - Since no concrete, initiated action is described (e.g., no past attempt or recent lethal action), it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. 
   - The combination of suicidal intent with a plan, method, and preparation aligns with 'Behavior'. The rules state that if a plan/method is present, 'Behavior' should be chosen over 'Ideation', and there is no ambiguity here.

I hate pets, so it's not helping me either way. I want to kill myself, already set a date 2 weeks ago and I'm approaching. Already started to cancel friendships.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses intense loneliness and hopelessness (""truly alone forever,"" ""struggled daily,"" ""what a joke""). It explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""I want to kill myself."" There is a specific plan indicated by ""already set a date 2 weeks ago"" and imminence with ""I'm approaching."" Preparations are described as ""Already started to cancel friendships,"" which suggests active steps toward the plan. No specific method (e.g., pills, gun) is mentioned, and there is no reference to past suicidal actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""I want to kill myself,"" indicating a clear personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no phrases like ""but I don't want to""), so this leans away from 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - A plan is present through the mention of a set date (""set a date 2 weeks ago"") and the imminence (""I'm approaching""). Preparations are evident with ""Already started to cancel friendships,"" which aligns with behaviors like distancing or getting affairs in order. No specific method or tools are described, but the date and preparations constitute planning elements for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (the set date is approaching) and current preparations (canceling friendships). There is no description of a past or recent initiated lethal action (e.g., no mention of having taken pills or engaged in self-harm). The actions mentioned are preparatory, not an actual attempt.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I want to kill myself"") rules out 'Indicator'. The presence of a plan (set date) and preparations (canceling friendships) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which requires no plan/method). Since no concrete, initiated lethal action is described (only planning and prep), it does not qualify as 'Attempt'. Therefore, it fits 'Behavior' due to the suicidal intent combined with planning elements and preparations.

Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look, its just death.",0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide"" directly, indicating suicidal thoughts. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (e.g., ""This life doesnt fit me,"" ""i dont like this shithole""), and the writer states they engage in behaviors like sleeping all day to avoid acting on these thoughts (""i have to so i dont kill myself""). The question ""Is suicide really as bad as everyone makes it look"" reflects abstract or philosophical consideration of suicide, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, or past actions are described. The overall tone suggests distress and internal conflict, with the writer explicitly framing their actions as preventive measures against suicide.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""suicide,"" indicating personal suicidal thoughts. However, the writer negates any current desire to act by stating they avoid suicide through their behaviors (e.g., ""i have to so i dont kill myself""). The question about suicide being ""just death"" lacks a clear expression of personal intent to die and instead shows ambivalence or curiosity. Suicidal thoughts are presented as unwanted, as the writer is actively resisting them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The references to suicide are general and lack any concrete planning elements. The absence of these details means this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings and preventive behaviors but no past or recent suicidal actions. There is no mention of an initiated, potentially lethal event (e.g., no description of an attempt that was stopped or failed). The focus is on ongoing distress and thoughts, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The writer expresses suicidal thoughts but explicitly states they do not want to act on them (e.g., ""i have to so i dont kill myself""), aligning with 'Indicator' (distress with unwanted suicidal thoughts, no genuine current desire to die). The abstract question about suicide reinforces this as a discussion of the concept rather than personal intent. There is no plan or method, ruling out 'Behavior', and no past action, ruling out 'Attempt'. Ambiguity about desire leans toward 'Indicator' per the rules.

467,I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it. Thats it I want to die but I'm too much of a coward to do it simple as that,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" multiple times, indicating a direct desire for death/suicide. It mentions ""do it"" in the context of suicide, implying self-harm intentions. Emotional indicators include hopelessness and self-deprecation (""too much of a coward""). No specific methods, plans, preparations, locations, or timelines are mentioned. The focus is on the internal conflict between the desire to die and fear preventing action. There are no references to past actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a clear desire to die with phrases like ""I want to die."" The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted or that they do not wish to act on them; instead, they attribute inaction to fear (""too much of a coward""), indicating the desire is present but not acted upon. This aligns with suicidal ideation rather than distress about unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means) are mentioned. The phrase ""do it"" is vague and lacks detail about how suicide might be carried out. Without any plan or method, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current state of mind (wanting to die) but no past, recent, or future actions. There is no indication of initiated suicidal behavior, such as an attempt or preparatory step. The inaction is explicitly attributed to fear, reinforcing that this is about thoughts, not actions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses a personal desire to die, placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts). The absence of a plan, method, or preparation rules out 'Behavior'. No past or recent initiated lethal action is described, so 'Attempt' is not applicable. This fits 'Ideation' as it involves explicit suicidal thoughts and desire without concrete plans or actions.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""commit suicide""), self-harm (""twist my dick off""), and death (""die of blood loss"").
   - Emotional indicators: The tone conveys despair and hopelessness, particularly around the inability to get a boner, but the primary focus is on suicidal action.
   - Specific method/plan: ""Twist my dick off"" is a described method intended to cause death by blood loss, and ""gonna wait it off a die of blood loss"" implies a plan to let the action result in death.
   - Preparations: No explicit signs (e.g., notes, acquiring means), but the method is clearly stated.
   - Past actions: None mentioned; all statements are future-oriented (""I'm gonna"").
   - Imminence: The phrase ""I'm gonna try here"" suggests immediacy, but no specific timeframe is given.

   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""commit suicide"" and ""die of blood loss,"" indicating a direct and personal desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method is mentioned (""twist my dick off"" leading to death by blood loss). This constitutes a plan/method, leaning the classification toward 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes future intentions (""I'm gonna""), not past actions. There is no description of an initiated, potentially lethal action (e.g., something already attempted). Thus, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The presence of explicit suicidal desire rules out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (""twist my dick off"" as a means to die) moves this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks a plan/method). Since no past or recent initiated action is described, it is not 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as the post includes both suicidal intent and a specific method/plan.

470,Sayonara. My disease are getting worse and my body are getting weaker. I will eventually die in a much painful way. I endured the physical pain and mental depression for years. I am lonely and have no reason to live,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post includes phrases like ""Sayonara"" (which can imply farewell), mentions worsening disease, physical pain, mental depression, loneliness, and a lack of reason to live. It explicitly references a future death from the disease (""I will eventually die in a much painful way"") but does not mention suicide, self-harm, or specific methods. Emotional indicators are present, such as hopelessness (""no reason to live"") and despair. However, there is no indication of a plan, method, preparation, or past action related to suicide. The death discussed is attributed to the disease, not self-inflicted means.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - No explicit mention of suicide, ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. The desire expressed is for the suffering to end due to illness, but there is no clear personal statement of wanting to die by suicide (e.g., ""I want to be gone"" is not present in a suicidal context). The phrase ""no reason to live"" suggests distress but does not unequivocally convey a desire for self-inflicted death. Since suicidal thoughts or intent are not explicitly stated, this leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation for suicide is mentioned. The death described is passive and disease-related, not active or self-directed. Without any planning elements, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses future death from illness (""I will eventually die"") but no past or recent self-initiated actions (e.g., no mention of a suicide attempt). The focus is on enduring suffering, not acting on suicidal thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post expresses significant distress, hopelessness, and a sense of burden, but lacks a clear, personal expression of suicidal desire or intent. Phrases like ""no reason to live"" could be ambiguous, but without explicit suicidal ideation, plan, or behavior, and given the context of disease-related death, it aligns with 'Indicator'. Rule: If in doubt between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose 'Indicator'. No elements support 'Behavior' or 'Attempt'.

471,"I'm starting to get envious when I hear about people dying/committing suicide successfully. Obviously no one should go through the grief of a loved one dying. I know it is wrong and disgusting to think about yourself when someone is in pain and someone's life. But I just couldn't help but think ""Why can't that be me? Why do I get to carry on living and they get to die?"" and the ever so disappointing question of ""Surely killing yourself isn't so hard right?"" to which the answer is always no. This is turning me into a bad person and I need to stop. I won't like start being healthy or chasing serotonin or whatever, I'll just try to be more considerate next time. I'll still be suicidal lol",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions envy of people who died by suicide (""Why can't that be me?"").  
   - Explicitly references suicidal thoughts (""killing yourself,"" ""I'll still be suicidal lol"").  
   - Expresses hopelessness (""disappointing question,"" ""bad person"") but no stated desire to *stop* suicidal thoughts.  
   - **No specific plan, method, tools, locations, or preparations** described (only abstract references to suicide difficulty).  
   - **No past or recent suicidal actions** described; all content is about thoughts/feelings.  
   - Desire to die is implied through envy (""Why do I get to carry on living?"") and explicitly confirmed (""I'll still be suicidal"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: Directly states ""killing yourself"" and ""I'll still be suicidal lol.""  
   - **Yes**: Expresses envy of others' deaths, implying a personal wish to die.  
   - **No negation**: Does *not* state unwanted thoughts (e.g., no ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific method** (e.g., pills, jumping) mentioned.  
   - **No preparations** (e.g., note, acquiring means) described.  
   - Abstract references to suicide difficulty do not constitute a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on **current thoughts/feelings** (e.g., ""I *am* envious,"" ""I *am* suicidal"").  
   - **No description of past/initiated actions** (e.g., no ""I tried to..."" or ""I took pills"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Explicit desire to die** (""Why can't that be me?"") and confirmation of ongoing suicidality → **Ideation**.  
   - Lacks any plan, method, or preparation → **Not Behavior**.  
   - No initiated or past lethal action → **Not Attempt**.  
   - Suicidal intent is personal and current → **Not Indicator** (which requires ambiguous desire or unwanted thoughts).

472,"Idk how to word this without sounding dumb. Am I the only one who wants to die but is still afraid of stupid little things like going to hell or something? Like at this point I am and have done some bad shit so I'm probably doing there anyways so it shouldn't matter, but I keep worrying about it. The dumb thing is, I do believe in God but I'm not as religious as my parents or anything so I really don't know why this is one of the only things keeping me alive. Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."". Sorry, this ended up being a lot longer than I intended. Also sorry if it seems like I'm whining about something as dumb as religious stuff. I guess I just needed to vent because I've been feeling really isolated recently and can't really talk about any of this to anyone, even my therapist.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly mentions ""wants to die"" and frames it as a current struggle.  
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I'm probably going there [hell] anyways""), isolation, and distress about religious fears.  
   - **No mention** of specific suicide methods, plans, preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes), or timelines.  
   - The writer explicitly states fear of hell is ""one of the only things keeping me alive,"" indicating a barrier to action.  
   - References to past actions (""have done some bad shit"") are unrelated to suicidal behavior.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: The phrase ""wants to die"" is a direct personal expression of a desire to die.  
   - **No negation**: While fear is noted as a deterrent, the writer does *not* state the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that they lack a desire to die (e.g., no phrasing like ""I don’t actually want to die"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **Absent**: No reference to tools, locations, substances, or preparations for suicide. Religious fears are discussed as a passive barrier, not a plan.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on current feelings and internal conflict (""I keep worrying,"" ""I’ve been feeling isolated"").  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, aborted actions).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Ideation**: The post expresses a clear personal desire to die (""wants to die"") but lacks any plan, method, or preparation. The mention of fear as a barrier reinforces the presence of active suicidal thoughts without progression to actionable steps.  
   - **Not Indicator**: The desire to die is explicit and personal, not abstract or unwanted.  
   - **Not Behavior/Attempt**: No evidence of planning, preparation, or prior suicidal actions.

For the past 2 years, since I moved back to my home country (Romania) I have been crushed by stress, mostly from school in 2019, I didn't have many friends and I cried myself to sleep most weeks, even activities I normally liked were boring, I thought of killing myself multiple times, but I always thought of my little brother, I love him so much and he is the only reason im alive right now, during the pandemic things got a little better, I was still dealing with a lot of anxiety but I got a friend who would listen to me and really helped me a lot. The reason I'm writing this right now is beacause, it has been getting much worse, I'm being crippled by stress and anxiety, I have no motivation to do anything also last year I realised I was atheistic and bisexual, my family is very religious and so are my friends, I came out to my only friend a couple of weeks ago and now he's being distant, he was the only person I felt safe talking to and the only person I talked to on a regular basis. All these things are bottled up in me and I feel like if I say this to anyone I know they will brush it off and say 'its just a phase' or 'your just a kid what do you have to stress about'.

I need help and I can't get it from anywhere.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions past suicidal thoughts: ""I thought of killing myself multiple times.""  
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't know how long I can cope""), anxiety, stress, isolation (friend distancing), lack of motivation.  
   - Explicitly states protective factor (little brother) prevented acting on thoughts.  
   - No current desire to die expressed; instead, distress about worsening mental state and inability to access support.  
   - No mention of specific plans, methods, preparations, or recent/past actions taken to harm self.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - Suicide is explicitly mentioned (""thought of killing myself""), but framed as **past** ideation.  
   - **No current desire to die** expressed; the focus is on distress and seeking help.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are contextualized as unwanted/overcome by protective factors (e.g., ""he is the only reason I’m alive"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - No specific method, plan, tools, or preparations mentioned.  
   - References to past ideation lack any planning elements.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Suicidal thoughts are explicitly in the past (""thought of killing myself multiple times"").  
   - **No description of past or recent initiated self-harm actions** (e.g., no attempts).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Expresses distress and historical suicidal thoughts but **no current desire to die** or active intent.  
   - Protective factors (brother) and lack of planning/preparation indicate distress about mental state, not imminent risk.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are presented as unwanted/past, aligning with **Indicator** (distress without current personal desire to die).  
   - No plan/method → not *Behavior*. No initiated action → not *Attempt*. Ambiguity about *current* desire leans toward *Indicator* over *Ideation*.

474,"Where can I find out how to die. I don't care if it's slow or painful or both, I just want to definitely die",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post directly mentions a desire to die (""definitely die"") and seeks information on how to die, indicating a personal wish for death. It expresses hopelessness and a willingness to endure pain (""I don't care if it's slow or painful or both""), but no specific suicide method (e.g., pills, jumping) or means are mentioned. There are no references to plans, preparations (like acquiring tools or writing a note), past actions, or imminent timing (e.g., ""tonight""). The focus is on seeking knowledge about dying, not on acting or having acted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly expresses a desire to die through phrases like ""I just want to definitely die."" There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; the author actively seeks ways to die, indicating genuine suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. The query ""Where can I find out how to die"" implies an interest in methods but does not state or imply a concrete plan. Without explicit details, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a current desire and inquiry about dying but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no mention of an attempt that was stopped or failed). It is focused on future intention without evidence of action.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content shows a clear, personal desire to die, fitting 'Ideation' (explicit suicidal thoughts without a plan or method). The lack of a specific plan or method rules out 'Behavior', and the absence of any described action rules out 'Attempt'. The strong suicidal intent distinguishes it from 'Indicator', which would apply if the thoughts were unwanted or abstract.

It does get better, and then it gets worse, and then it gets better, and then worse, etc. I'm tired of buying time from myself over and over again. I'm tired of fighting to heal when the only reason I'm trying is to make it easier to keep putting myself through life so I don't hurt my loved ones. But honestly? Sometimes I just don't care about them anymore. Maybe that's shitty.

Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Key elements: Expresses persistent lack of desire to live (""not because I want to be alive,"" ""don't really want [a future]""), emotional despair (""tired of fighting,"" ""constant fear and pain""), and references to suicidal history (""if I do attempt again"").  
   - Explicit suicide/death intent: Confirmed via ""familiar will to die"" and conditional statement about attempting suicide (""if I do attempt again"").  
   - Plan/method/preparation: No specific method, tools, or immediate preparations mentioned. Timeline is vague (""a few months out"").  
   - Temporal context/action: **Explicitly references a past suicide attempt** (""attempt again"") and implies lethality (""I'm not going to fail"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""will to die"" and ""if I do attempt again"" confirm personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - No. Distractions (""plans to look forward to"") are non-suicidal. No method/preparation details provided.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Past action: Confirmed concrete suicide attempt (""attempt again"").  
   - Current ideation/behavior is present but secondary to the disclosed past action.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - **Attempt** category takes precedence because the post describes a past self-initiated, potentially lethal action (even if interrupted/failed). The phrase ""attempt again"" explicitly meets the 'Attempt' definition. Current distress/ideation does not override this.  
   - Rules: Past attempt trumps concurrent ideation/behavior.

I've fucked my education up, I've fucked my relationships with other people up, I've fucked up everything in my life. I simply won't live a comfortable life in the slightest, it'll only continue to get worse as it always has. At the stage I'm at, I don't even want to live a comfortable life anymore, I don't want any more chances. I just want the pain to stop.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Mentions ""take my life"" explicitly and expresses a strong desire to end pain through suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I don't want any more chances""), despair (""I've fucked up everything""), and anhedonia (""can't see myself going on to live a normal life"").
   - Specific methods: ""gun to the head"" and ""kitchen knife"" are named as potential means.
   - Preparation/timeline: References a 480-day plan for gun access and daily temptation to use a knife immediately (""Each day I've been more tempted..."").
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday"" or ""I cut myself but stopped""). Focus is on future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Explicit phrases: ""take my life,"" ""I just want the pain to stop"" (implied death as relief), and ""I don't want to live.""  
   - Desire to die is unambiguous and personally claimed; no negation of intent (e.g., no ""but I won't do it"").

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Specific methods: ""gun to the head"" and ""grab a kitchen knife.""  
   - Preparations/timeline: ""Going by my plan"" (480-day wait) and daily consideration of knife use.  
   - Clear planning elevates beyond ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - Describes future intent (""I'm going to take my life,"" ""tempted to just grab a kitchen knife"").  
   - No past/ongoing *initiated* actions (e.g., no ""I tried yesterday""). Focus is on imminent urges, not completed behaviors.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - **Not Indicator**: Explicit desire to die and suicide planning rule this out.  
   - **Not Ideation**: Specific methods (gun/knife) and timeline (""plan,"" ""480 days"") indicate planning.  
   - **Not Attempt**: No description of past/recent initiated lethal actions (e.g., no ""I took pills"").  
   - **Behavior**: Suicidal desire + specific methods + preparations (timeline, daily temptation) fit the criteria.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post mentions ""thoughts of suicide"" but frames them in the context of seeking help (e.g., asking about inpatient care and medication).
   - Emotional indicators include feelings of inadequacy (""all I failed to do""), difficulty concentrating, and a sense of isolation (""everyone in my life is focused on their career goals"").
   - The writer explicitly states a desire to live: ""I'm genuinely trying to find the courage to actually live"" and ""convincing myself I deserve to live."" This indicates distress about suicidal thoughts but not an active wish to die.
   - No specific suicide methods, plans, preparations, or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.
   - No references to past or recent suicidal actions or attempts.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post explicitly mentions ""thoughts of suicide,"" but it does so while seeking solutions (inpatient care, medication) and emphasizes a struggle to live. The suicidal thoughts are presented as unwanted, not as a current desire to die. The writer's stated goal is to ""find the courage to actually live,"" which negates genuine suicidal intent.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., writing a note) are mentioned. The focus is on treatment and coping, not on planning suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses current feelings and questions about treatment, but it does not describe any past or recent initiated suicidal actions (e.g., no mention of an overdose or self-harm attempt).

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress and unwanted suicidal thoughts but lacks a clear, current desire to die. Instead, it shows a proactive effort to seek help and affirm life, aligning with the 'Indicator' definition (general distress or abstract discussion of suicide without personal suicidal intent). There is no evidence of a plan or method for suicide (ruling out 'Behavior') or any described past action (ruling out 'Attempt'). The mention of suicidal thoughts is countered by the writer's explicit focus on survival, making 'Ideation' inappropriate as there is no genuine expression of a wish to die. Per the rules, when unsure between 'Indicator' and 'Ideation' due to ambiguity about desire, 'Indicator' is chosen.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kill myself"" explicitly, indicating suicidal intent. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""Nothing to say ever,"" ""No future""), despair (""Everyday is the same,"" ""I'm 40 and unemployed""), and anhedonia. A specific method (""Bridge"") and timeline (""on Monday"") are stated. There are no references to past actions or preparations (e.g., notes, acquiring means). The desire to die is personal and current, with no indication that the thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself,"" showing a clear desire to die. There is no statement negating this desire or indicating unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Yes, a specific method (""Bridge"") is mentioned, and the timeline (""on Monday"") implies a plan. No explicit preparations are noted, but the method itself qualifies for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - The post describes a future intention (""going to try on Monday""), not a past or recent initiated action. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - The explicit desire to die and specific method (""Bridge"") move this beyond 'Indicator' (which lacks personal suicidal desire) and 'Ideation' (which has desire but no plan/method). The presence of a method aligns with 'Behavior'. Since no action has been initiated (only planned), it is not an 'Attempt'.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions ""kms"" (kill myself) multiple times, references a ""hangman's noose"" as wallpaper ""to stay on track,"" and describes overcoming a ""big hurdle to kms"" (ensuring the mother won't be affected). Emotional indicators include distress (""it's so hard,"" ""one of the hardest decisions""), and there is a stated desire to die (""before I go""). Specific methods are implied through the noose imagery, and preparations include setting the wallpaper and addressing logistical hurdles. No past suicide attempts are described; actions like changing the wallpaper are preparatory, not initiated lethal acts. Imminence is suggested with ""when I do it,"" but no specific timeline is given. The desire to die is personal and not negated (e.g., no expression of unwanted thoughts).

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""kms"" (kill myself) and phrases like ""before I go"" or ""when I do it"" indicate a clear, personal desire to die. There is no statement that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted; instead, they are presented as part of the author's current contemplation.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, a specific method (hangman's noose) is mentioned and incorporated into the wallpaper as a reminder ""to stay on track."" Preparations include changing the wallpaper to reinforce this and overcoming a hurdle (ensuring the mother's situation) to facilitate the suicide. This indicates planning and preparatory behavior beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post discusses past actions (e.g., changing the wallpaper, overcoming a hurdle) and future intentions (""when I do it""). However, no specific, initiated suicidal action is described (e.g., no mention of attempting to hang oneself or taking pills). The actions mentioned are preparatory and not potentially lethal in themselves.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die and references to suicide (e.g., ""kms"") rule out 'Indicator'. The mention of a specific method (noose) and preparations (wallpaper, logistical planning) elevates this beyond 'Ideation' (which lacks plan/method). Since no initiated lethal action is described, it does not meet the criteria for 'Attempt'. Therefore, 'Behavior' is the best fit, as it involves suicidal thoughts with a plan and preparations.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post explicitly states ""I want to die"" and expresses intense emotional distress (hopelessness, worthlessness, anxiety, feeling like a ""failure"").  
   - **Crucially**, the author later contradicts the initial statement: ""I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore."" This explicitly negates a genuine desire to die.  
   - No mention of plans, methods, preparations, timelines, or past actions. The focus is on emotional pain and a plea for help (""someone please help me"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Explicit phrase ""I want to die"" is present, but it is **directly negated** by the author's subsequent statement: ""I don't want to die."" The primary sentiment is distress about existence, not a current desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:  
   - **None identified**. No references to tools, locations, plans, or preparations.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:  
   - Describes ongoing emotional struggles and hopelessness about the future. **No past or recent suicidal actions** (e.g., attempts, self-harm) are mentioned.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The author expresses suicidal thoughts (""I want to die"") but explicitly states they **do not want to act on them** (""I don't want to die"").  
   - The core theme is distress about life circumstances and identity, not a current desire to die.  
   - Lacks any plan/method/preparation → *not* Behavior/Attempt.  
   - Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire is resolved by the explicit negation → **Indicator**.

481,"Can't take it anymore. I'm a 20 year old with a son, I have no college degree but I did graduate high school. I feel like I failed my son already, I've been working dead end jobs for the past year so I can support him and his mom. I love my son so much but I feel like he'll be better off without me, there's so many great fathers out there and I just wish I could be that for my son. I'm worthless as fuck. I've been thinking about just getting it over with.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post expresses hopelessness (""I feel like I failed my son,"" ""I'm worthless as fuck""), despair (""Can't take it anymore""), and feeling like a burden (""he'll be better off without me""). It mentions suicidal thoughts with ""I've been thinking about just getting it over with,"" which implies a desire to end one's life. However, there is no mention of specific methods (e.g., pills, guns), preparations (e.g., writing a note, acquiring means), or locations. No past actions related to suicide are described, and there is no indication of imminence (e.g., ""tonight""). The writer does not state that these thoughts are unwanted; instead, the context suggests a personal desire to die to escape their situation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The phrase ""getting it over with"" is an indirect but clear reference to suicide in this context of despair, indicating a personal desire to die. It is not explicitly negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to""). Therefore, there is explicit suicidal intent. Answer: Yes.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned. ""Getting it over with"" is vague and lacks details about how, when, or where. Therefore, there is no evidence of a plan or preparation. Answer: No.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes current thoughts (""I've been thinking"") but no past or recent actions. It does not reference any initiated suicidal act (e.g., an attempt that was stopped or failed). The focus is on ideation rather than behavior or history.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die (suicidal intent), placing it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires no such desire or unwanted thoughts). The absence of any plan, method, or preparation means it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'. Since no past or recent suicidal actions are described, it is not an 'Attempt'. Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation', as it involves suicidal thoughts with desire but no plan or action.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post describes multiple explicit references to suicide methods and past actions: aspirin overdose at age 15 (initiated but survived), gun purchase and trigger pull at age 21 (malfunction prevented death), rope hanging attempt recently (initiated but failed due to pain), and current setup of an ""exit bag"" with gas valve turned on (initiated but stopped due to panic).
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""lifelong depression,"" ""depersonalization,"" ""feeling so empty""), despair (""fought with this for a long time,"" ""felt despair over my desire to die""), loneliness (""nobody in my life anymore""), and ambivalence (""scared of it failing and scared of dying"").
   - Specific plans and preparations are detailed: researching methods (e.g., exit bag setup, noose positioning), acquiring means (purchased gun, rope, exit bag), and actions taken (turning gas valve).
   - The temporal context includes past attempts and a very recent action with the exit bag (""Today, I have an exit bag set up"" and turning the gas valve).
   - The writer expresses a persistent desire to die but with current fear and anxiety, indicating ambivalence rather than a clear negation of suicidal intent (e.g., no statement like ""I don't want to die"").

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""committing suicide"" and describes multiple personal suicide methods (pills, gun, hanging, exit bag) with a clear desire to die (e.g., ""desire to die,"" ""made decisions... pushed people away"" in a suicidal context). The suicidal thoughts are not framed as unwanted or resisted; instead, they are acted upon.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Yes, specific methods are mentioned (e.g., ""exit bag,"" ""purchased rope,"" ""gun,"" ""aspirin pills""), and preparations are detailed (e.g., ""made an exit bag,"" ""set up,"" ""done it perfectly,"" turning the gas valve). This indicates active planning and readiness, not just ideation.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references past suicide attempts (aspirin overdose, gun incident, hanging) as concrete, initiated actions that were potentially lethal but failed or were interrupted.
   - Crucially, it describes a very recent, self-initiated action with the exit bag: turning the gas valve, which was potentially lethal but stopped due to panic (""I turned that gas valve... I turned off the gas""). This constitutes an initiated suicide attempt that was interrupted by self, fitting the 'Attempt' definition.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The content goes beyond general distress (Indicator) due to explicit personal desire to die and detailed methods.
   - It exceeds Ideation because there is not just a desire but specific plans, methods, and preparations (e.g., exit bag setup).
   - It surpasses Behavior because an action was initiated (turning the gas valve), making it more than planning or preparation alone.
   - The exit bag incident is a recent, concrete, potentially lethal action that was self-initiated and interrupted, aligning with the 'Attempt' category. Past attempts reinforce this, but the current focus is on the initiated action.
   - Therefore, 'Attempt' is the best fit, as the definition includes interrupted or failed actions.

483,Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile. I'm a garbage person who should just end my life for my benefit and the benefit of those around me. I'm just a leech who will never accomplish anything.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post explicitly mentions suicidal intent with ""should just end my life,"" indicating a desire to die. It also includes emotional indicators like hopelessness (""Don't see a future where my life becomes worthwhile""), feelings of worthlessness (""I'm a garbage person""), and being a burden (""for my benefit and the benefit of those around me,"" ""I'm just a leech"").
   - There are no references to specific methods (e.g., pills, weapons), preparations (e.g., writing a note), or locations. No past actions or attempts are described, and no temporal imminence (e.g., ""tonight"") is indicated.
   - The desire to die is personal and not framed as unwanted or distressing thoughts; instead, it is presented as a solution to the author's problems.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""end my life,"" which explicitly conveys a personal desire to die.
   - The author expresses a genuine wish to die for perceived benefits, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or resisted (e.g., no statements like ""but I don't want to act on it""). This rules out 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The suicidal intent is general, without details on how it would be carried out.
   - Due to the absence of any planning element, this does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post focuses on current feelings and thoughts about suicide, with no description of past or recent actions (e.g., no mention of an initiated attempt, interruption, or failure). Therefore, 'Attempt' is not applicable.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The content shows a clear, personal desire to die (""should just end my life""), placing it above 'Indicator' (which requires no explicit suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - The lack of any specific plan, method, or preparation means it does not qualify for 'Behavior' (which requires such elements).
   - With no described actions, it cannot be 'Attempt'.
   - Thus, the post fits 'Ideation' as it expresses suicidal thoughts and a desire to die without concrete plans or preparations.

484,I'm about to kill myself. I don't see a reason to live. Life sucks.,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post contains direct mentions of suicide: ""I'm about to kill myself"" explicitly references self-inflicted death. Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""I don't see a reason to live"") and general distress (""Life sucks"").
   - There is no mention of a specific suicide method (e.g., pills, gun), plan details, or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note). The phrase ""about to"" implies imminence but does not specify a method or action.
   - The writer expresses a clear, personal desire to die with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated (e.g., no statement like ""but I don't want to"").
   - No past actions or attempts are described; the focus is on current/future intent.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly states ""kill myself,"" indicating a direct personal desire to die. The context of despair (""I don't see a reason to live"") reinforces this as genuine suicidal intent, not abstract or unwanted thoughts.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tools, locations, or preparations are mentioned. The statement is general and lacks concrete planning elements. Without these, it does not meet the criteria for 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post describes a future intention (""about to"") but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no description of an attempt that was started). This rules out 'Attempt'.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The explicit desire to die (""I'm about to kill myself"") and lack of any plan/method/preparation align with 'Ideation'. 'Behavior' would require evidence of planning, which is absent. 'Indicator' is inappropriate due to the clear personal suicidal desire. 'Attempt' does not apply, as no concrete past action is described.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions ""face death"" and ""gonna start working out until i die or pass out,"" indicating a direct confrontation with death and a self-destructive plan.  
   - Emotional indicators: Anger (""too pissed""), resignation (""embrace the pain""), and hopelessness (""don’t even want to feel good anymore"").  
   - Specific method: Excessive working out with the intent to cause harm (""until i die or pass out"").  
   - Preparations: Explicitly states starting the action imminently (""now gonna start"").  
   - Temporal context: Immediate plan (""now"") with a defined outcome window (""12 hours"").  
   - Desire: Expresses active acceptance of death (""if not, well, you know what happened"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - Yes. Phrases like ""face death,"" ""work out until i die,"" and ""if not, you know what happened"" show a personal desire to die.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - Yes. Method is clearly stated (working out to death/passing out), and preparation is underway (""now gonna start"").  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes a future plan (""gonna start"") with imminent initiation (""now""). No past action described—only intent to act.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (Ideation) + specific method/preparation (Behavior).  
   - Not ""Attempt"" because no action has been initiated yet—only planning imminent action.  
   - ""Behavior"" fits best due to the stated plan/method and immediate preparation.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""contemplated suicide for years"" and ""I know I am going to do it,"" indicating a personal and ongoing consideration of suicide.
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness about the future (e.g., conflict over retirement savings due to the belief they will die before retiring) and ambivalence (""I want to experience a few more things before I do"").
   - No specific methods, tools, locations, or preparations for suicide are mentioned (e.g., no references to pills, weapons, notes, or acquiring means).
   - The timeline is vague and non-imminent (""maybe in my 20's or 30's""), with no indication of immediate action.
   - There is a clear desire to die expressed (""I know I am going to do it""), but no statement that the thoughts are unwanted or that the author doesn't intend to act on them; the ambivalence is about timing, not the underlying desire.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" and phrases like ""I know I am going to do it"" convey a personal desire to die.
   - No indication that the suicidal thoughts are unwanted or that the author resists acting on them; instead, the author plans to act after experiencing more things.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific method, tool, substance, location, or preparation is mentioned or implied. The retirement savings dilemma is unrelated to suicide planning.
   - Without any plan or preparation elements, this cannot be classified as 'Behavior'.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post references past contemplation (""contemplated suicide for years"") and future intent (""I know I am going to do it""), but no past or recent initiated actions (e.g., no attempts, interruptions, or failures described).
   - Contemplation alone does not constitute an action; it remains in the realm of thoughts.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a clear personal desire to die with suicidal thoughts, meeting the threshold for 'Ideation'.
   - There is no plan, method, or preparation mentioned, ruling out 'Behavior'.
   - No past or recent suicidal actions are described, ruling out 'Attempt'.
   - The presence of explicit suicidal intent and desire distinguishes this from 'Indicator', which would apply if the thoughts were unwanted or lacked personal desire.
   - Therefore, the best fit is 'Ideation'.

487,Can duloxetine kill you?. I have a few pills that I've been saving for later.,2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - The post mentions duloxetine (an antidepressant) and questions its lethality (""Can duloxetine kill you?"").  
   - The user states they have pills saved ""for later,"" implying potential preparation for misuse.  
   - No explicit emotional distress (e.g., hopelessness) is stated, but the context suggests concern about the drug's fatal potential.  
   - No past actions or timelines (e.g., ""tonight"") are mentioned.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**  
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself.""  
   - No clear expression of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone"").  
   - The question about lethality implies possible suicidal ideation but lacks explicit personal intent.  
   - **Conclusion:** No explicit desire to die stated. Leans toward *Indicator*.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**  
   - Specific method (overdosing on duloxetine) is strongly implied by questioning lethality + saving pills.  
   - ""Saving pills for later"" indicates **preparation** (acquiring/storing means).  
   - **Conclusion:** Plan/method/preparation is present → *Behavior*.  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**  
   - No description of past/initiated actions (e.g., ""I took pills"").  
   - Focus is on future intent (""saving for later"").  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - While no explicit desire to die is stated (*Indicator*), the combination of questioning lethality and saving pills confirms **preparation for a specific method** (overdose).  
   - Rules: Preparation + implied method → *Behavior*.  
   - *Behavior* overrides *Indicator* here due to clear evidence of planning (saving pills for potential misuse).

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses strong emotional distress (""hell,"" ""out of place,"" ""need to stop feeling this way"") and feelings of disconnection (""anything cared about my life... isn't me""). 
   - The key phrase is ""I just want to end but haven't yet."" This implies a desire to cease existing but explicitly states no action has been taken. 
   - No mentions of death/suicide methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. 
   - Emotional tone centers on hopelessness and alienation.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - No direct phrases like ""suicide"" or ""kill myself."" 
   - ""Want to end"" suggests a desire to stop existing (aligned with suicidal ideation), but lacks absolute clarity about death intent. 
   - No negation of desire (e.g., ""but I don’t want to die""). 
   - **Leans toward Ideation due to implied desire to end life**.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, jumping), tools, locations, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) mentioned. 
   - ""Haven’t yet"" confirms absence of action but doesn’t imply planning. 
   - **No evidence for Behavior**.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION**:
   - Focuses on current feelings (""Today’s a great day. It’s hell""). 
   - ""Haven’t yet"" references inaction, not past attempts. 
   - **No description of initiated self-harm**.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - Explicit desire to ""end"" (though not verbatim ""die"") + despair context indicates **personal wish to cease living**.
   - Absence of plan/method/preparation rules out 'Behavior'. 
   - No past/ongoing concrete suicidal action rules out 'Attempt'. 
   - Strong distress and ideation place this above 'Indicator' (which requires ambiguous/unwanted thoughts).

I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",2,behavior,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Mentions death/dying/suicide: ""I could be dead by the end of the day today"" and ""I cant off myself"" directly reference suicide.
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""distracts from life""), fatigue as a barrier, and self-conflict (""My brain is my body’s worst enemy"").
   - Specific method: Explicitly mentions ""buy the gas"" (implying a method like carbon monoxide poisoning).
   - Preparations/actions: No evidence of active preparation (e.g., acquiring gas, writing notes). Fatigue prevents action (""never leave the house"").
   - Imminence: Hypothetical (""could be dead today"") but not actionable due to stated barriers.
   - Desire: Clear wish to die (""off myself"") with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**: 
   - Yes. ""Dead by the end of the day"" and ""off myself"" are explicit personal expressions of suicidal desire.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**: 
   - Specific method: ""buy the gas"" clearly implies a plan (carbon monoxide poisoning via gas). 
   - Preparations: None described (fatigue prevents acquiring means). 
   - **Result**: Method is explicitly stated, so 'Behavior' is indicated.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**: 
   - Discusses future hypothetical action (""could be dead today"") but emphasizes inaction due to fatigue. 
   - No past/initiated lethal actions described. 

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**: 
   - Explicit desire to die + specific method (""gas"") = **Behavior**. 
   - Barrier (fatigue) doesn’t negate the presence of a plan/method. 
   - No initiated action (so not 'Attempt'). 
   - Distinction from 'Ideation': Method is specified beyond vague intent.

   - The writer expresses a clear desire to act on suicidal thoughts (""I should just... do it already""), with no indication these thoughts are unwanted.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:

So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit mentions of suicide (""planned to kill myself,"" ""plan to hang myself"") and self-harm (""started to cut my rights leg""). It describes emotional distress (overwhelm, loss of motivation, nervous tics) but also claims happiness and lack of sadness. Specific methods are detailed (hanging, cutting off a finger with an axe), and preparations are complete (""Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car""). A past plan to kill oneself in January is mentioned but not acted upon (""But I didn't""), and no past suicide attempt is described—only self-harm for calming. The current plan is imminent (""now it time to stop the lie and end it"").
   - Emotional indicators: Hopelessness (""I was done with everything""), anhedonia (loss of motivation), and burden (faking school, lying to family) are present, but the author explicitly states ""I'm not sad or depress.""
   - Plan/method: Clear and specific—hanging with an axe for self-mutilation, with tools and location (forest, highest tree) specified.
   - Preparations: Explicitly stated as complete (""Everything is ready"").
   - Past actions: Self-harm (cutting leg) is mentioned, but it is not described as a suicide attempt; it was for calming. The January suicide plan was not acted upon. No initiated, potentially lethal suicidal action is described.
   - Imminence: The plan is current and future-oriented (""now it time,"" ""I plan to hang myself""), with no specific timing like ""tonight,"" but the readiness suggests urgency.
   - Desire: The author expresses a clear, personal desire to die (""end it,"" ""kill myself"") without indicating these thoughts are unwanted or resisted.

   - Yes, the post explicitly mentions ""kill myself"" and ""hang myself,"" and expresses a clear desire to die (e.g., ""end it""). There is no statement that suicidal thoughts are unwanted or not desired; instead, the author is resolved to act.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - Yes, a specific method (hanging, cutting with an axe) and location (forest) are mentioned. Preparations are explicitly stated as complete (rope, axe, car ready). This goes beyond mere thoughts.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past plan (""planned to kill myself in January"") that was not acted upon, and past self-harm that was not suicidal. The current content focuses on future intentions (""I plan to hang myself"") with no description of a past or recent initiated, potentially lethal suicide action (e.g., no mention of taking pills or jumping but surviving). Therefore, no 'Attempt' is indicated.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows explicit personal desire to die, moving it beyond 'Indicator' (which requires lack of clear suicidal intent or unwanted thoughts).
   - It includes specific plans, methods, and preparations, so it is not 'Ideation' (which lacks these elements).
   - No past or recent initiated suicidal action is described, so it is not 'Attempt' (which requires evidence of a concrete, potentially lethal action).
   - The presence of a current plan with ready means fits 'Behavior' best, as per the definition: ""explicit personal expressions of suicidal thoughts/desire to die AND also mentions a plan to commit suicide, a specific method, or preparations being taken.""

492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post discusses existential despair and the pointlessness of life (""What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway?"", ""there still is no point for us being here""). It includes emotional indicators like hopelessness and anhedonia (e.g., ""life is what you make it but I feel like... no point""). Crucially, the author explicitly states, ""I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die,"" indicating distress without a current desire for death. There are no mentions of suicide, self-harm, specific methods, plans, preparations, or past actions. The tone is philosophical and general, not personal or actionable.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The post does not explicitly mention ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or similar direct phrases. While it references death abstractly, the author negates any personal desire to die (""don't really want to die""). Suicidal thoughts are not present; instead, the focus is on unwanted existential distress. This aligns with 'Indicator', as there is no clear, personal expression of a desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific plan, method (e.g., tools, substances), location, or preparation (e.g., note-writing) is mentioned or implied. The content remains at the level of general dissatisfaction, reinforcing the lack of behavioral elements.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes current feelings about life's meaninglessness but no past, present, or future suicidal actions. There is no reference to initiated events, attempts, or interruptions.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post expresses distress and hopelessness but lacks a personal desire to die or explicit suicidal ideation. The statement ""don't really want to die"" clearly negates suicidal intent, placing this in 'Indicator'. It does not meet the criteria for 'Ideation' (which requires a desire to die), 'Behavior' (which requires a plan or method), or 'Attempt' (which requires a past lethal action). Ambiguity is resolved per rules: when in doubt between Indicator and Ideation, choose Indicator, but here the lack of desire is explicit.

493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,0,indicator,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - The post expresses intense shame, embarrassment, and anxiety about social judgment due to purchasing a used sex toy and others knowing about it.  
   - Key emotional indicators: shame (""very ashamed""), fear (""afraid of what everyone will think""), hopelessness about social acceptance (""first impression of me is that I am disgusting"").  
   - **No mentions** of death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, preparations, or past actions related to suicide.  
   - The author seeks advice (""What do I do"") and explicitly asks others not to reinforce their shame (""please don’t leave a comment about how disgusting I am"").  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **No explicit phrases** like ""suicide,"" ""kill myself,"" or ""want to die.""  
   - **No expressions** of a desire to die or not be alive; distress is focused on social rejection, not ending life.  
   - Suicidal thoughts are **not mentioned at all**, wanted or unwanted.  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No references** to suicide plans, methods (e.g., pills, weapons), locations, or preparations (e.g., notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Describes past events (buying the item, being mocked) and future fears (starting a new school).  
   - **No description** of past or recent suicidal actions, attempts, or preparations.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - The post shows **distress and hopelessness** but lacks any personal expression of suicidal desire, plans, or behaviors.  
   - Falls under **Indicator**: distress is centered on shame/social anxiety without suicidal intent. Ambiguous cases lean toward Indicator, and here there is zero evidence of suicidality.

494,families are really selfish. they bought u into this world and then you suddenly get sick of it. and they dont let you kill yourself. what kind of an asshole move is that?why do you want me to suffer just for your well being and your pleasure? what the fuck is wrong with you?,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**: 
   - The post expresses anger towards family, accusing them of selfishness for not allowing suicide. Key phrases include ""they dont let you kill yourself"" and ""why do you want me to suffer."" 
   - There is a mention of suicide (""kill yourself""), but it is framed as a general complaint about being prevented from acting, rather than a personal declaration. 
   - Emotional indicators include hopelessness (""sick of it"") and suffering, but no specific plans, methods, preparations, timelines (e.g., ""tonight""), or past actions are described. 
   - The desire to die is implied but not explicitly stated as a current personal intent (e.g., no ""I want to die"" or similar). The focus is on distress about external constraints.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - The phrase ""kill yourself"" is explicit but uses ""you,"" which could be rhetorical/general; it is not a direct statement like ""I want to kill myself."" 
   - There is no clear, personal expression of a desire to die (e.g., ""I want to be gone""). Instead, the writer emphasizes suffering and frustration with family. 
   - Suicidal thoughts are not explicitly stated as unwanted or resisted; however, the lack of a personal, affirmative desire to die leans toward 'Indicator'.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - No specific method (e.g., pills, gun), plan, location, or preparations (e.g., note-writing) are mentioned. The post is solely about the idea of suicide being prevented, not about how or when it might occur.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post discusses a general, ongoing situation with no reference to past or recent actions (e.g., no description of an initiated suicide attempt). It is rhetorical and not time-specific.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post shows distress and abstract discussion of suicide but lacks a clear, current, personal expression of suicidal desire (e.g., no ""I want to die""). The mention of suicide is in the context of blaming others, not affirming intent.
   - With no plan or method, it cannot be 'Behavior'. No past actions rule out 'Attempt'. Ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (implied but not explicit) means 'Indicator' is appropriate per the rule: ""If in doubt between Indicator and Ideation due to ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire, choose Indicator.""

495,lol god damn am i lonely. nobody fucking cares till i say im going to do it. Nobody cares ever. Im such a spoiled piece of shit pls fucking end me before the day. pls,1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:  
   - Mentions emotional distress: loneliness (""am i lonely""), feeling uncared for (""nobody cares""), self-loathing (""spoiled piece of shit"").  
   - Explicit plea for death: ""pls fucking end me before the day. pls"" indicates a direct desire to die.  
   - References to suicide via implication: ""nobody cares till I say I’m going to do it"" suggests threatening suicide to gain attention but does not specify a plan, method, or preparation.  
   - No mention of past actions, methods (e.g., tools, locations), or preparations (e.g., notes).  
   - Temporal urgency (""before the day"") implies immediacy but lacks concrete actionable details.  

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:  
   - **Yes**: ""pls fucking end me"" is an unambiguous personal desire for death.  
   - No indication these thoughts are unwanted or passively experienced (e.g., no qualifiers like ""I don’t want to act on this"").  

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:  
   - **No specific plan/method**: ""I’m going to do it"" vaguely implies intent but lacks details (e.g., method, tools, location).  
   - No preparations described (e.g., acquiring means, writing notes).  

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:  
   - Focuses on *current* despair and desire to die (""end me before the day"").  
   - No description of past or recent suicidal actions (e.g., attempts, interrupted behaviors).  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:  
   - Explicit desire to die (""end me"") qualifies for **Ideation** or higher.  
   - Absence of specific plan/method/preparation rules out **Behavior**.  
   - No described past/recent suicidal actions rules out **Attempt**.  
   - Strong suicidal intent (""end me"") and lack of disclaimers about unwanted thoughts disqualify **Indicator**.  
   - **Conclusion**: Meets criteria for **Ideation** (clear desire to die without plan/method).

496,"There's been a couple of stabbings recently in my area, I hope it'll be me next. Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family  with a suicide it'll be just another stabbing and thats that.",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**
   - Key elements: The post mentions hoping to be a victim of a stabbing to die (""I hope it'll be me next""), avoiding the shame associated with suicide (""Wouldn't have to bring shame in the family with a suicide""). There is an expression of desire to die, but it is passive and external (hoping for death by stabbing rather than self-inflicted). Emotional indicators include feelings of shame and hopelessness. No specific plan, method, or preparation for suicide is described; the stabbing is framed as a hoped-for external event. There is no mention of past actions or imminent personal intentions.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT:**
   - The post explicitly mentions ""suicide"" in the context of avoiding it due to shame, but the author's personal desire is for death by being stabbed, not by suicide. The phrase ""I hope it'll be me next"" expresses a clear desire to die or not be alive, but it is not an explicit statement of suicidal intent (e.g., ""I want to kill myself""). Instead, suicide is presented as an undesirable alternative. Suicidal thoughts are implied but negated due to shame, leaning towards distress about the consequences rather than a current personal desire to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION:**
   - No specific suicide plan, method, or preparation is indicated. The reference to stabbing is not a self-initiated method but a hope for external harm. There is no mention of tools, locations, or preparations for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT:**
   - The post expresses a current/future hope (""I hope it'll be me next"") but no past or recent initiated actions. No concrete suicidal behavior or attempt is described.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**
   - The author expresses a desire to not be alive (passive death wish), which falls under suicidal ideation. However, there is no explicit personal desire for suicide (as suicide is rejected due to shame), and no plan or method for self-harm is present. This aligns with 'Ideation' due to the clear desire to die, but if there is ambiguity about genuine suicidal desire (since the means are external), the rules specify to lean towards 'Indicator'. Here, the primary sentiment is a desire to die with distress about suicide, but the lack of a personal suicidal plan or explicit suicidal intent means it fits 'Ideation' for the desire to not be alive. However, the thinking process states that if suicidal thoughts are mentioned but unwanted, it leans toward 'Indicator'. Since the author explicitly rejects suicide as shameful and hopes for death by other means, the core is a general death wish without current suicidal intent, making 'Indicator' more appropriate under the rules (especially the ""if in doubt"" clause for Indicator vs. Ideation).

497,"how to run from everyone and simply killmyself?. okay so i will go straight to the point and i dont want any affection or ""oh dont do that your life is more worth than that and blablabla"" im 19 i have 0 friends, never had a girlfriend basically 0 social life, no skills no job no money, i want to put an end to it all but there is something blocking me to do that and ots my family, how can i just disappear? idk go to another country have another identinty and etc so i can just kill myself with peace and with no one knowing it? maybe was just an accident idk, thanks and sorry for the bad english",1,ideation,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - Key elements: The post includes explicit phrases like ""killmyself"" and ""put an end to it all,"" indicating a desire to die. Emotional indicators of hopelessness and despair are present (e.g., ""0 friends,"" ""no skills no job no money""). The author mentions a plan to ""disappear"" by going to another country and changing identity to facilitate suicide (""so i can just kill myself with peace""), but no specific suicide method (e.g., tools, substances, locations) or preparations (e.g., acquiring means, writing a note) are described. The temporal context is future-oriented (""how can i just disappear?""), with no references to past actions or attempts. The author expresses a genuine wish to die, with the only barrier being family concern, not an unwillingness to act.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post explicitly uses ""killmyself"" and ""kill myself,"" along with ""put an end to it all,"" showing a clear personal desire to die. There is no indication that these thoughts are unwanted or negated; the author is seeking a way to overcome the barrier (family) to act on them.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - While the author discusses disappearing to another country as a setup for suicide, this is not a specific suicide method or preparation. No tools, substances, locations, or concrete steps for the act itself (e.g., ""overdose,"" ""jump,"" acquiring pills) are mentioned. The plan is vague and focused on anonymity rather than execution, with uncertainty expressed (""idk""). Therefore, there is no clear indication of a plan, method, or preparation for suicide.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes future intentions (""how can i just disappear?"") with no mention of past or recent initiated actions. All content is contemplative, not behavioral.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The explicit desire to die and suicidal thoughts place this above 'Indicator' (which requires no personal suicidal desire). The absence of a specific method or preparation rules out 'Behavior' (e.g., no details on how suicide would be carried out). With no past or recent actions described, 'Attempt' does not apply. Thus, the content fits 'Ideation': personal expressions of suicidal desire and thoughts, but without a plan, method, or preparations.

I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT! AND I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!. THIS NEEDS TO END! NEEDS TO!. I'm gonna try again tonight. But if THAT doesn't work, I have another plan in mind. But Plan B's gonna be more painful. This is the least pain-proof way I could die. Oh, and one more thing. If God doesn't take me to Heaven, then he's a dumb, selfless bitch. People with depression shouldn't be punished for killing theirselves even more.",3,attempt,"<thinking>
1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS**:
   - The post explicitly mentions a suicide attempt: ""I tried to kill myself last night via suffocation using a mask and a plastic bag underneath my blankets."" This describes a specific method and a past action.
   - Emotional indicators include intense despair, frustration (""WHY! WHY! WHY!""), and a strong desire to die (""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL!"" and ""THIS NEEDS TO END!"").
   - Specific methods are detailed (suffocation for the past attempt, and an implied ""Plan B"" for the future).
   - The action was initiated and potentially lethal (""I ALMOST FUCKING DIED LAST NIGHT"") but failed due to involuntary breathing.
   - Future intentions are stated: ""I'm gonna try again tonight"" and ""another plan in mind,"" indicating imminent risk.
   - The desire to die is personal and explicit, with no indication that these thoughts are unwanted.

2. **EXPLICIT SUICIDE/DEATH INTENT**:
   - Yes, the post uses direct phrases like ""kill myself,"" ""I tried to kill myself,"" and ""I FUCKING WANTED TO AS WELL,"" showing a clear, current desire to die.

3. **PLAN, METHOD, OR PREPARATION IDENTIFICATION**:
   - A specific method (suffocation with a mask and plastic bag) is described for the past attempt.
   - Future plans are mentioned (""gonna try again tonight"" and ""another plan""), but the key focus is on the already-initiated action.

4. **TEMPORAL CONTEXT & ACTION ASSESSMENT**:
   - The post describes a past event: a concrete, self-initiated, potentially lethal action (""tried to kill myself last night"") that was interrupted (by breathing) but still qualifies as an attempt under the definition.
   - Although future plans (e.g., trying again tonight) are present, the description of the past attempt takes precedence for classification.

5. **CATEGORY REASONING**:
   - The post goes beyond ideation or behavior because it details a specific, initiated suicidal action that was potentially lethal, even though it failed. This fits the 'Attempt' category.
   - 'Behavior' would apply if only plans or preparations were mentioned without a past initiated action, but here an action was taken.
   - 'Attempt' is prioritized over other categories when a past or recent concrete action is described, as per the rules.

1. **CONTENT ANALYSIS:**  
   - Mentions tiredness (""soooo tierd""), wanting to sleep constantly, feeling ""empty,"" and worry about triggering a depressive episode that might damage friendships.  
   - No references to death, dying, suicide, self-harm, methods, plans, or preparations.  
   - Emotional indicators include emptiness and depressive concerns but **no hopelessness, despair, or burden statements**.  
   - Focuses on distress about potential relational consequences of depression, not a desire to die.

   - Describes **current emotional state** (tiredness, emptiness) and **future worry** (depressive episode), but **no past or recent self-initiated actions** related to suicide.  

5. **CATEGORY REASONING:**  
   - Expresses distress (depressive feelings, emptiness) and anxiety about relationships, but **lacks personal desire to die, suicidal thoughts, plans, or actions**.  
   - Fits **Indicator**: General distress/sadness without suicidal intent. Ambiguity about depressive episodes leans toward ""Indicator"" per rules.

   - *Not Behavior/Attempt*: No plans, methods, preparations, or past actions.
