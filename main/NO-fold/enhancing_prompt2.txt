I am trying to improve a prompt for classifying suicide risk from social media posts into four categories: Indicator, Ideation, Behavior, and Attempt.
Based on my prompt and corresponding metrics, provide a new prompt that will improve classification performance.
Here is my current prompt:
"""Based on the social media post provided, return the category that the post belongs to based on the following four categories and their definitions.
---
 Indicator:
Definition: The post or content lacks any explicit expression concerning suicide. There may be general expressions of distress or sadness, but no direct mention or indication of suicidal thoughts or feelings. May include also a vague feeling about dying or death but no explicit mentioning of suicide. Note that the mentioning of suicide need to be very explicit in order to not be 'indicator'. Very large general dissatisfaction about life and hopefullness is still 'indicator' when suicide/killing oneself is not mentioned. When in doubt whether the suicide was explicitly mentioned or not choose 'indicator' over 'ideation'
Ideation:
Definition: The content includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts or feelings, i.e. a desire to not be alive any longer, but without any specific plan to commit suicide. This can range from vague thoughts about not wanting to live to stronger, more explicit desires to end ones life (albeit without a specific plan how to do so). If no desire to die or to commit suicide is expressed, consider it 'indicator'. If the post contains specific ideas of how to commit suicide (ways/locations/means/methods) consider it 'behavior'. 
Behavior:
Definition: The post includes explicit expressions of suicidal thoughts and also mentions (even if only briefly) a plan to commit suicide or exhibits self-harming behavior. It must include some form of explicit planning like a specific method or preperations taken (e.g. suicide note, lethal medication/drugs, tools/weapons (e.g. knifes/guns/ropes) suitable to end ones life, suitable locations (e.g. bridges/cliffs/buildings to jump off from, train lines to get run over by). If you are unsure whether there is a explicit plan or not choose 'ideation' over 'behavior'
Attempt:
Definition: The content describes past attempts at suicide. This category is focused on historic actions rather than current plans. A concrete action need to have happened in the past (e.g. overdose). When someone merely thought of an attempt in the past this classifies not as an 'attempt'
Note that when a post refers to past attempts but also mentions current plans then label it as 'attempt'
---
Note that the suicide risk only corresponds to the person writing the post not of other people potentially being mentioned.
Only answer with one word. It should be always one of the following  'indicator', 'ideation', 'behavior', 'attempt'   
Never answer with something different than one of the four options. Never answer with NaN or empty answer
