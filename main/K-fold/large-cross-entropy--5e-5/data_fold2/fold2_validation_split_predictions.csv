Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it.

20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore.

Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well.

I can't look my girlfriend in the eyes let alone find the courage to ask for help. I realized I haven't looked in the mirror in years because I can't stand the person looking back at me. Dont get me wrong I've looked at my clothes or my new haircut but I can't look beyond the surface. The facade I've built up is that of strong man and I'm so afraid to admit that I'm no longer him that I've shut myself out as much as everyone else. I haven't been to work in 4 days. I haven't even gotten out of bed. My girlfriend thinks I hate her because I can't find the words to tell her I want to die.

Women can valuation and offers while a Man has to do all the work (yay equality amirite /s). I've been bullied, harassed, treated like shit my whole life.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy.

If you disappeared, I assure you that your dad would be happier, and don't start with your depression bullshit, that I got tired of that"" -My mom. ""I'M TALKING TO YOU! ANSWER! You know what? Just shoot yourself already"" -mom. ""You know I always invite you with my girlfriend? But you never want to come. I'm not leaving you alone; you are leaving yourself alone. YOU ARE THE PROBLEM"" -Dad. ""What? Did you try to kill yourself again? So be it, You are too coward to actually do it, anyway"" -Dad. ""Did you vomit your food again? I'm tired of this shit. You are wasting MY MONEY. You know what? I won't buy you food anymore because you vomit it anyways. That valuable money could serve other purpose and don't you dare tell your mother about this because you are the one that started this problem"" -Dad. ""I just had a lot of fun with my girlfriend and her daughters. Oh! You were there? I didn't even notice you"" -Dad. ""What? Had a bad day at school? Are you going to try to kill yourself again?

Just go lock yourself in your bathroom, you know, as you always do. HAHAHA"" -Dad. ""I got tired of this depression you have, and my girlfriend got tired of your fucking depression too. If I buy you an iPhone, could you just start being normal?"". Me: Dad, If you are treating me like this, why did you want to have a daughter in the first place. Dad: When I had a daughter, I didn't know it was going to be as disappointing as you. ""All the family knows about you. They are al disappointed"" -mom. &amp;#x200B;.

But at the same time I'm hesitant because what if I don't die, but instead get permanently disabled and have to sit in a wheelchair for the rest of my life?. I don't want to have to be crippled like that, so I'm not risking it. And before anybody says anything, no, I'm not calling a suicide hotline.

428,"I feel as if all I've done through school and my other trials all just go to support the things I hate and that we're only seen as special if people need or want something from us. School and work have drained me the fuck out of all my motivation in the things I love. And the fact that all the work I've put into it has been useless to support them all out in the end while having a limited output on myself has taken my will to strive in a lot of this. I don't see a point in my parents for guidance because of their overwhelming comparison to my fucking relatives or siblings each time. I believe we're stuck in a system and forced to be milked out of work labor until we're exhausted and thrown out. This neverending process only helps the things I hate the most, and I don't know what to do anymore with my life.",indicator,indicator,0.9997057318687439,0.0002922728890553117,1.3241906060557085e-07,1.9033035414395272e-06

447,"Is it suicidal to not go to the doctors?. I feel like I'm at the point in my life where if I die then I die. As of right now I don't have any plans to end it, but I have stopped visiting the doctor's and willing to accept when my time has come. Even if that means I die at 50 or earlier.

452,"Is life actually worth living anymore?. We've been in this pandemic for a year now and very little, if anything, seems to have improved. I don't know if I can take it anymore, or if I want to spend the rest of my life taking a mental beating from constant restrictions and lockdowns. We have waited a year. We have vaccines but the government can't distribute them fast enough in my country. Now we have another outbreak which appears to be getting out of hand. I've already been through two lockdowns, and I fear this new outbreak will just spread across the country and nullify all of its supposed achievements. What happens if my country just goes back into recession, I become unemployed again and I am just back in the same position I was when this all started, all while under constant pressure from university?. COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine. Do I really deserve to live in this excruciatingly oppressive, boring and dystopian world. Surely, suicide is appropriate now?. I refuse to spend the rest of my life like this. I don't want to live in this collapsing world and I want out. I don't see what there is to live for. As far as I can see, the virus has won. Why even bother at this rate? How can people justify living like this? We've been patient, we have persevered we have sacrificed so much and it has all been for nothing. Surely, I can just call it quits now?. Death seems a better option to me than living in this world. I don't even feel alive; I just feel like I am ‘existing'. I can hardly function anymore. I can barely sleep without waking up in the middle of the night for no obvious reason.

456,Feel like dying again. I noticed that I was actually in a decent mood for the last couple of weeks. Didn't really have panic attacks or feel the endless misery of depression. Until now. I'm back to feeling like shit. And this will most likely affect work and stress out my manager which will stress me out even more. Just kill me. There's no end to anything.

459,Happy people makes me suicidal. Whenever I see happy people I immediately get sad and have suicidal thoughts because I know I will always be a loser who will never make friends.
