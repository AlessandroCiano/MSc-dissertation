43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods.

I hate being alive but I don't have the heart/bravery to kill myself, so instead I have to go through life wishing that someone will just end my life for me. if only assisted suicide could be approved for terminally suicidal people. I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy.

I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job.

I've been testosterone for two years but everyone still sees me as female and I'm too timid to correct them. So being overweight plus dysphoria really adds to the self loathing. And even worse, I'm also interested in guys but I'm also asexual (I think). Like, who the hell would want to date someone like me. My last relationship ended because I was trans I think, and it was with another trans man. He didn't see me as man enough so I don't think I'll ever be good enough. I already strike out for not being cos, but throw in not wanting a sexual relationship and it's an all around no go.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts.

I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it.

I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do?

411,"suicidal thoughts. HI i'm a 15 year old girl and all my entire life i have been dreaming of becoming a high fashion model when i grow up but there's a problem only tall people can walk the ramp short people are not allowed. Ik that i can be a commercial model if i want to because there is no height requirements but i really2 want to be a high fashion one because that's what i've always wanted ,my whole entire life. If i don't choose the carreer that i want i know that i will never be happy with my life. I haven't grow since last year and to make it worse im only 4'11 feet and the height requirements for runway models are 5'7 to 5'8 or 9. I feel so hopeless with myself that's why i want to give up my life and just die. And that's not the only reason, all my friends are getting taller then me and i am losing my self esteem very fast. I REALLY WANT TO DIE but i can't leave my parents too,im their only child and if they lose me i don't even want to know what will happen to them. I FEEL TRAPED. THERE'S NO FUTURE FOR ME. IF I LIVE I KNOW I WLL NEVER BE HAPPY WITH MYSELF AND IF I DIE I KNOW MY PARENTS WOULD BE DEVASTATED. I hate myself, i really hate myself. i'm so hopeless and such an idiot, why did i want to choose such a career where i know there is no future for me.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly. I guess I just have bad karma and have done something to deserve this so I feel like nature is just telling me it's time to die. I don't expect any one to respond or even read this.

Also sorry to talk about this subject, to most of you I probably sound dumb since not a lot of people are religious. I just haven't been able to talk to anyone I know who *is* religious about this cause they just tell me I'm not being a good Christian or that I just need to ""give it to God."".

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",attempt,behavior,5.708011030947091e-06,3.529833634274837e-07,0.9528471231460571,0.04714682325720787
