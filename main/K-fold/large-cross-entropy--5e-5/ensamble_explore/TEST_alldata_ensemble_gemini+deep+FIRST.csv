18,TW: *Mention of self harm*\n\nI wish I had someone to talk to. I recently had really bad anxiety last night. When I do spiral I text my bf and he ends up worrying for me. I didn't text him the rest of the day because I was trying to recollect myself and I know he's busy working. \n\nHe later texted me that he was worried the whole day. I called him to let him know I was doing better and let him know what happened. \n\nNow I feel guilty for worrying him and he said his head hurt and he's going to sleep. Maybe he won't say anything but I feel like I worried him for nothing. Now I feel like I should stop texting him for a few days because I honestly feel like a burden. \n\nI can't keep it all to myself. I end up going to a dark place and feel alone. I self-harmed one time a from anxiety and guilt that snowballed. I feel those thoughts creeping up and I really don't want it to lead to that. \n\nI also just have a hard time opening up to friends. Mostly because I feel like there needs a place and time. I'm getting better at opening up more and more but it takes time and mental health discussions are something that I haven't worked towards yet. It's probably the hardest obstacle for me.\n\nThere's no way I can afford any therapy to help with these habits right now. I don't have a summer job and I'm going to college in the fall so I may have to save some money or something.\n\nI suppose I can try counseling again at the university. I just hate that it takes a while to get an appointment. Thank you for anyone who's finished reading this.',,indicator,indicator

56,"'Scared I\'m gonna act on my thoughts. Been struggling way worse lately, half of it is my ""dad\'s"" fault (I put the quotations because I hate him he scares me) I took about two months leave of school because my mental health went down the drain, now I have to go back and I\'m supposed to be going back to school slowly but dad doesnt give two shits and throws me in like nothing happened. School has been so hard, I can\'t focus and the smallest things annoy me. Exampel; I sit by myself near the front of my science class cause I have no friends, one lesson a teacher sat next to me to work with another kid and she wouldnt stop tapping her leg. I, It annoyed me so much i couldnt focus and started ripping my page up with my pen and not doung work for the rest of the lesson. had a hass test and my neck, back and chest hurt and i got mad so i started leaninng against the desk as hard as i could to hurt my chest i couldnt do the wuiz and flunked it lurposley; even though i understanded some of the questions i didnt answer correctly. I wasnt always this angry but lately the littlest things make me so mad, when I cant move a tab on google so i can have two things open at once makes me want to hit the computer, my dad breathing loudly all the time, people shiffting their hands on their clothes and making noise pisses me off, mum and dad singing irritates  me plus they suck at it, ect. I hide in the toilets at school half the time, the no phone rule is shit, my phone is my safe space and break from reality and I cant even drown out those filthy fucking freaks with music. My classmates are racist, ableist and homophobic, they say slurs and everything. They say them so fucking loudly but what does the teacher do? NOTHING THEY FUCKING IGNORE IT WHAT THE FUCK, THIS IS WHY KIDS KILL THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE TEACHERS LET THE ONLY DECENT CHILDREN BE SURROUNDED BY THESE FREAKS. Schoo is the main reason i want to kill myself its awfull, I\'m tired of people telling me to just ""push through it"" I understand thats the only option but i dont want to accept that, I want to be happy and learn not memorize things so I cant forget them. I\'m 13 and in year 9 and everything wer elearning is scary and I dont want to learn it because I dont need to use it. They get mad at me for not focusing when they teach the mist boring shit. I\'m so scared I\'m so scared I dont want ro kill myself but im so scated im going to act on my thoughts I dont want to die but I dont want to go to school. Does anyone relate?

I remembered the laundry door was unlocked so i got up to lock it, my dad woke up and asked what i was doing. I started bursting out in tears because I seriously thought i was goinng to die that night, he says its nothing and then i just go back to my room. Then he gets mad at me because im sitting up on my bed, like xcuse me? Im not going to go to bed immediately i just heard scary shit and burst out crying, i tokd him to shut up and go away because i was already mad at him from previous incidents. I sat for maybe anothee minute then dad comes outs, i had my flashlight on and dad thought i was in my ohone? Idk it was obvious i wasnt. He got really mad at me and tried to snatch my ohone away, he moved really fast and he was really scaring me. I took it before he could grab it and then he wouldnt leave me alone. I started crying really loudly because he was freaking me out he left after like two minutes of me telling hi mto get away from me, i was so fhcking scared he was going to hurt me ir poor boiling water on me. Then he brang it up the night after for no reason, he didnt even apologize. I ahte my dad hes the worst and makes me hncomfortable and makes me feel worthless. I know it was a small incident but it really hurt, i thought i was going to die that nught so that didnt help :( my mum didnt care about the situation and my friend and brother are the only people who seem to get mad about it and listen to me.

Here I am yet again the same loser who would never make it out of this treacherous pit. I\'ve been trying to push myself to kill myself for the last few weeks. Tgere were moments of ups and downs. But I just cant. I chicken out like I did in almost everything in life. \n\nI\'m almost 30 years old for fuck sake. I don\'t have a job coz I am so stressed to work in the fucking accounting and auditing field I have knowledge about. I am ""trying"" to get a job for the sake of my grandma eho us worried sick of me. My parents are still trusting my sorry ass that I would find a job and get martied snd ""live happily ever after"". How can I tell them that I have let them down?\n\n The rest of my family have lost hope in me. I have had warnings and serious advices from all family members to get my act straight. I\'ve been called a laxy bum by my relatives. My brother calls me a selfish guy as I am living on other people\'s money and almost disowned me. I know he didn\'t and I wish he did. \n\nI don\'t mean to sit on my ass and play township all day eating sleeping and shitting forever. I wish I could be on my own. But the thought of life scares me. I hate the field I\'m semi qualified for. I fucked up the final exams after wasting an year including the lockdown and postponement of exams last year. I tried to find a way out of this field but all my ""unrealistic"" ideas didn\'t seem to work. I thought I could become a part time teacher as I always liked to teach. But my brother who is a very successful and know it all genius of the family pointed out that teachers are already jobless and I am a stupid idiot who would fail his students as he can\'t even get himself to pass an exam. I can\'t become a writer coz that requires some intelligence which I don\'t have. I can\'t run a business of my own as I am broke and I would fail that too. I can\'t do anything else. I am stuck and keep going down this quicksand pit. \n\nEven if I suck it up and get a job in the audit field, what am I gonna do? I would be replaced by someon who is actually resourceful in a matter of no time. Even if I become good in my job, what next? Work for 60 hours a week for the next 30 years on something that drives me crazy? Get married for the sake of family? Get a bunch of kids snd add their well being and education into the list of my ever expanding troubles? Make connections with people I don\'t like for the sake of social status? Why is that life for anyway? \n\nWhat the fuck is wrong with me? Everyone else seems to be enjoying this godforsaken way of life that has sslaved us to our luxuries and  social status. Why can\'t I suck it up and become a zombie and do whatever I\'m told to? Why is my brain not able to get the message? \n\nI have been noticed by teachers and friends to have signs of ADHD sibce school days. But my family who don\'t believe in mental illness knows better.

At least I didn\'t molest anyone to satisfy my curiosity. I just learned masturbation when I was 10 and did it like 4 times a day until I turned 25. I developed a craving for pleasure even before I knew what it is. I am still suffering fighting hard to control my thoughts. \n\nI dropped out of school when I was 13 and put back in school at 19. Worked my way through without thinking about what I really want and went on with what my family thought would be good for my future.

70,"I'm trying my best to be happy but something inside of me is telling me to die. Fuck you depression. Can anyone talk to me now. I can't take it anymore, I've been through too much. Please just let me rest eternally. I want to be a boy and the fact that people see me as a female makes me want to die. I hate living within these rigid gender expectations and having women call me girl. It is extremely triggering for me. I hate how my dad always mentions getting married and having children but honestly I fucking hate children and I would never give birth to one. I hate wearing feminine clothing and tight clothes and clothes that show off my legs in general. I want to wear suits and jackets and long clothes in general. I also hate how men sexualize women and I hate how men hit on me just because I happen to be an available female. I hate how creepy strangers approach me on the street just because I am a female. I want to be left the fuck alone. Is hanging 100% effective. As in if I try hard enough, I can die. I want to scream until I lose my voice. I hurt my voice the other day screaming for a few minutes but now I want to completely wreck my vocal cords. Anyone talk to me rn. I woke up too early. People say I look depressed. No shit dumb ass \nWant a fucking cookie. I can't overcome my problems. It's too difficult. I want to give up. My mind can't decide whether I want to be a male or female and it's pissing me off. I just feel physically and mentally worn out 24/7 and I'm only 22. I'm already screwed for the rest of my life because I'm so tired of it already. I just want to be pretty and skinny. I feel happy when I think I'm a guy. I hate washing my hair. Should I shave my head. You have to be an asshole in this world to survive. And the nice ones end up suicidal, after they get used and abused by most of these assholes. People make fun of suicidal people. And that's fucking disgusting. This is why the world should be hit by a meteorite and destroy the scum of humanity.'",,ideation,behavior

Can it be night time again already can already feel its  gonna be a bad bad day feeling so anxious and tired. I can't stand this I really can't I hate what I've become be better off dead. Literally just had enough living for  other people I hate waking up to a sense of confusion and terror. Let it be over please please please please can't do this much longer. Awful hypnagogic hallucinations in sleep/wakefulness really disturbing, sleep between 4 and 7 incredibly disturbed, awful. Now I really feel like I'm losing it!. Wonderful start to the day everyday I feel like I'm losing it more and more and now the sleep/wake hallucinations are creeping back. Marvellous, really how long before I lose it completely‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ Feel terrible now paranoid and anxious and I got to try and make it through the day somehow! I don't know how much more I can take of this shit I really don't! Just want it over and done with one way or another! OK woke up anxious didn't sleep great but was so worth it üòòüòòüòòüòò feeling sort of calm now so gotta ride with it. Whatever happens its gonna be up and down as always nothing changes. Got pills to take if it gets too much but gotta try not to let the foggy angsty confusion get the better of me. Or it's curtains for this one! Another day of trying to do this bs why oh yeah to save everybody else's suffering but don't worry about my suffering eh. I need to stay alive and sane for the people I love but it's becoming harder and harder can't do this just wanna scream at top of my lungs and find the tallest thing and jump or just run in front of a train can't stand this argh! Feel like I'm detaching from myself and I'm slipping into a state I can't escape and there's really only one way. I'm falling back into the darkness and I can't see a way out the only way now is well. the obvious. It doesn't feel scary anymore, it feels like it's something I have to do so I don't lose my mind and become completely enveloped by this. I can't even describe how I'm feeling just not right and displaced somehow. I thought I would end it a while ago but I really wasn't committed to it but now I sincerely feel there isn't any other way. I'm in a head space I can't escape from I'm in a void I can't leave. I don't feel anything like myself I don't really feel connected to myself. I'm to fucked up now for this world I know I have people to live for but feeling like I don't really care so much anymore. I can't live like this anymore, I don't want to and I can't seem to escape it so its really the only right thing to do. I don't know when or how but its going to have to happen soon, that much I do know. Another day another whole load of anxiety and over thinking and confusion. When does this end like literally when do I become free of this or so i have to make myself free‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ‚ÄΩ', ""Well here we go again another morning woke up utterly confused and anxious marvelous here goes. Trying to make it through is crazy hard to do I'm literally like done with this bs I can't be living life like this all the damn time gotta come a point when enough is enough. Scared to take the antibiotics I know I need to treat my uti. So scared of side effects no Interaction with my usual meds but scared of side effects v sensitive to antibiotics at best of times. Woke up anxious, confused and a general feeling of uneasiness can't let its dictate the day though. Gotta not let it rule the day gotta try and power through best as I can.

89,"I wanna die, but other people need me and it sucks. Hello, in the last few months i became pretty okay with sucide, i'm not afraid of death really, i already have a plan and all the reasons, but i feel like i shouldn't leave yet because of the potential guilt i would feel if i leave others. I'm currently living for other people and don't really see a brighter future for myself so it's just a matter of time when i will stop giving a fuck about others as well. I was wondering if there is someone else with similar situation and what is stopping you from offing yourself? Telling your loved ones about it. I decided that it's my time to go, i'm not asking for support or anything, i am sure about this decision but i'm asking you how can i tell my family that it's my final decision and nothing will change my mind? I'm going to starve myself to death because i'm dealing with lots of issues that can't really be solved. I'm 20 years old and my parents are pushing me to live more and don't really understand the situation. They will probably keep telling me to eat which is only natural to say if you care about someone but i've made up my mind. So another question, can they force me to eat if i end up in hospital or drug me? Thanks. I got a question. Does anybody have any experience or knowledge with starvation/VSED? I have lots of health problems and decided it's finally my time to go. Heard it's actually quite peaceful to go this way so i wanted to hear your opinions on that. Thanks.",,behavior,behavior
