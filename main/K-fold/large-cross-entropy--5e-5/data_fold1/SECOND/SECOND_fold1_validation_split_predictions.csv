66,"Help me. Ive been suicidal for about 10 years, whilst i have been able to distract myself with jobs short term relationships ect the feelings are always there. Over the last 2 years ive looked for excuses to get rid of the close ones in my life, right you did that your gone. Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you.

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",attempt,attempt,6.919797215232393e-07,2.8560243059416734e-10,2.9656447964043764e-07,0.9999990463256836

I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it.

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines. I'd rather not vent to a stranger on a phone since I get phone anxiety, and rather dump this online.

I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

251,"What's the point?. It's been 548 days since my sister willingly and voluntarily ended her life. She'd had her struggles for her entire life, and had made attempts in the past. I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

281,"Covid makes it worse. I am in hell. I'm so alone, and that's true even when I'm amongst other people. I have insane abandonment issues, but simultaneously this painful feeling of inability to connect when people are open. When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one. But for handguns I'm too stupid to understand if a small caliber or large caliber really makes a difference if shooting myself through my upper palate in my mouth. I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable. It doesn't get better. If you are holding out for a miracle, no miracle is coming.

285,"Why is always the stupid little things that push me over the edge and make me want to die?. I feel like this is going to sound so stupid to anyone else. The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over. I have always struggled to get on with my parents - they have been emotionally/spiritually abusive since I was a teenager, probably before. I don't want to be here, I don't know why I come here when spending time here makes me want to not exist. I have no one else. I'm done. I have a migraine and it's making all of the feelings worse. Obviously, there is more going on than this, but why the hell is this the thing that has pushed me over the edge? I feel stupid. I feel like I shouldn't be feeling this at all and I shouldn't be angry about the kitten thing. I'm beyond pissed that they think that's a helpful thing to do. I'm angry that they are trying to force these kittens to feel safe when it took me three weeks to get to this point with them. They've been with them 2 days. &amp;#x200B;.

I've been severely depressed lately and have always struggled with depression throughout my life. Everyday I feel like a shitty person for my past decisions/mistakes. I've ruined practically all of my relationships of potential relationships by being so emotionally unstable and anxious. Looking back at my past behavior makes me feel so much shame with myself.

They say I'm the only person they really tell about this type of stuff anymore so that's a plus. Although they've made it clear it's not helping. They have multiple suicide attempts per month probably even every week they just don't tell me everything. They've tried therapy and counseling in the past but it's hard when their abusive mother doesn't believe depression is. I thought having her open up would help her, because she always hides behind a wall where she acts like everything is perfectly fine and suppresses every bad thing that can happen. But I'm fairly certain talking about it doesn't help her especially when I'm suicidal myself and don't have much to say back. Her mom and her brother are physically and mentally abusing her in every way imaginable. Making fun of her when she opens up, gaslighting her and making her believe this is some cry for attention and overreacting, not believing in depression at all, times they've attempted to kill her, and so much more but you get the idea. Child protective services and the cops apparently don't help with the unsafe household. What else am I meant to do? I'm so confused and scared that one of these times I'm going to lose her and I just want to help. This isn't even all that's wrong with her, there's so much more too such as. -Insomnia. She stays up for multiple days on end. -When they do try and sleep they have lucid dreams of their body hanging and they can't look away. -Borderline personality disorder and bipolar (both officially diagnosed). -The thought that she's an accident from her father's affair and blames herself for being ""walking PTSD"" for her non biological mom she lives with. -Abondment issues from her past mom leaving, ex girlfriend leaving, and friends leaving (one of them due to suicide). -Eating disorders. This one I'm not sure about but she goes days at a time without eating. AND SO MUCH MORE. -. I don't even want to get into it all because this post has been long enough.

I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control.

I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test. He believes that it could all be anxiety, so I started taking Cymbalta. So far nothing has helped went from 30 - 60 - 30 MG. Now I feel hopeless and nothing has helped me, I really don't know what to do anymore. I've tried so much. On my neurotransmitter test I had a low vitamin D so now I take that and nothing helps. Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice. I've grown doubtful of others' advice to my struggles.
