4,"Is there a painless way to die. I'm struggling. My family and friends  have been trying to be supportive but I still feel unmotivated. I feel so sorry for them but I'm so selfish I can't get off my lazy ass to do anything worthwhile. The world scares me. I don't want to interact with people outside my close circle, and even with them I'm not consistently communicating. More often than not, I just want to stay in my room and be on the internet. This pandemic really reinforced this. I'm currently unemployed and I'm already in my 30s. I haven't even been in a relationship before coz I fear intimacy and feel worthless. I'm tired. I want to sleep forever but I don't know how to die with certainty and without pain.",ideation

Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it.

I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",indicator

I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday.

Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",attempt

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

Never have I felt a lasting happiness. Why do people think everything is perfect with me? I (metaphorically, unfortunately) kill myself working like a crazy bastard so I can get to an Ivy League college and away from my parents, away from this shitty country and shitty town. God, why can't I have someone who actually knows me and isn't afraid to be with me? Not the me I present to everyone, but the actual me. The only people like that exist in my head. I daydream about love and being loved by everyone, I have an imaginary family, but the moment I realize I have nothing but the opposite? It hurts. It hurts so bad. I'm at that point where my problems aren't bad enough to warrant true horror or empathy from someone, but just bad enough to fuck me up. I hate this. There are people who have it worse than me, and I'm crying like a fucking sissy. Why can't I be better? Why was I chosen to suffer through this painful middle ground?. I wish I live just long enough to go into some sort of illusion land where I'm not fat, I'm not ugly, I have everything I want and need, and where I'm not a morally abhorrent piece of crap. I just want to not exist. No one in my life understands me, because if they do? They run. And this has been a cycle for years.

38,"Friend may kill himself soon. Unsure what to do. I have a good friend that I met online 14 years ago, and we finally met in person last year and really connected on a much deeper level. I have been suicidal on-and-off for much of my life due to having a bad case of Crohn's Disease and because of stress, anxiety, and depression. Fortunately, I am in a good place now and haven't had suicidal ideation in months (which is a first for me). I did have one very serious attempt in 2009 which almost succeeded. Anyways, my friend has been struggling with chronic depression and severe anxiety for much of his life, as well as neuropathic pain and disc degeneration of his spine. He has been on a large number of different medications and nothing has helped him significantly. He has tried various therapies and seen many psychiatrists, psychologists, and therapists. Nothing has substantially helped him. The last couple of years have been particularly hard on him, and he is now really struggling. He is now at the point where he seems to have decided that he is going to commit suicide at some point in the near future (could be days). He is married and has a partner of 18 years. I'm not sure what I should do. I am there for him in any capacity he needs me, to listen, to offer suggestions, and to try to distract him or help him devise strategies to make it through the day, and to provide my perspective over how emotionally difficult it was for me to try to commit suicide (which is why I failed: I faltered in my plan due to second thoughts and regrets). If I told his partner - who is somewhat controlling (not in a way that is abusive - he is just very high strung) - it would be a disaster, I think, and I suspect it might make things worse. Do any of you have any suggestions? He was committed once to a psych ward for a night due to having severe issues sleeping (according to him) and he said it was the worst night of his life, so I would never want to put him in that position again, either. He keeps waiting for the universe to hand him a miracle or a sign or purpose, and I don't think the universe works that way: I think you have to go out and make your own purpose, but of course, when you are severely depressed, just getting out of bed can be an overwhelming effort. Any suggestions / perspective would be much appreciated.",indicator

I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close.

I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not.

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."".

121,"Are we going? AA DEPRESSED I WANT TO DOIE. It's the truth, you choose to not face the reality of the situation. You are depressed, you have no skills valuable to other people insomuch as it will give you purpose, probably you are not religious. Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames. Let the world know that you considered yourself normal, it is the world that wronged you and the world is wrong, not you. With some extension ladders and isolated wire cutters you can produce so much mayhem and it's not even funny.

She's been constantly tired. I'm trying to get her to eat and go out and do stuff but she won't and isn't doing well. I think she's really overwhelmed and it's getting to her that she has been advised the police not to respond at all; aka in her mind, not being able to standing up for herself.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",ideation

So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family?

I know how precious that is, and to be completely fair I don't always wish to be gone, however there are a LOT of unanswered questions and loose ends in my life, I am confused and terrified a great deal of the time; about what I'm doing, what I've done, and what I might have to do. Life on this planet is never easy, and there will always be people who've had it worse than me and made it out alive. But for now, in this moment as I write this, all I feel is that somber loneliness I've come to befriend over the last few months, but I just hope I'm not alone.

Nothing is happening in my life, and when I get home all I want to do is rest. All for little pay that my mother then takes half of. I don't know if or when I will take my own life, but if I do, I want to submit my thoughts here. Recently, I've been thinking about whether it would be best to end myself, as it is no different from what I am doing now. While I hate playing victim, I do believe my life was set up in a way that would lead to failure. Or at least make it more difficult to achieve success. I also argue my family plays a part in this. Raised by a single mother, living in a house of single women, has stunted me. Now I work a job I do not like, with mode of transportation that is destroying my body. The work itself also destroys my body, and then I have to use that transport to get home. My body is not getting enough time to even recover. The pay isn't worth it, and then I get part of my paycheck sapped for bills. It's difficult to save up and I constantly need to buy healthy food because my family's diet isn't the best. By next paycheck, my bank account is peanuts in a pocket. It's pathetic. And make no mistake, I take responsibility in this as well. It just feels I have to take the responsibility of their would be husbands/boyfriends, instead of being built to go out and start a family of my own. They aren't even expecting me to leave! I'm 27 turning 28 in December!. I just feel stagnant. My body is destroyed constantly. So I haven't been able to workout as hard as I used to. Of I try to leave, my mother will think I'm just quitting and not finding other work. Don't know where she got that notion. But I'm sick of it. Nothing is happening and I don't believe my environment facilitates forward moment. Therefore it is probably best I head out before it gets worse.

I have never caused damage to any human body or any property other than my own when I was alone.

That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her.

317,"Why is suicide viewed as such an overwhelmingly negative act?. First off, it is a deeply personal and private affair. For those people (myself included) who would rather die prematurely then go on to live their lives, suicide is seen as a solution to the problem. Personally, I don't view it as a negative act; only a means of escape that I know will help me do so. I will absolutely get what I want when I end my life, no doubt about it. The people around us who do not share the same feelings (and couldn't quite possibly relate) are the ones who attribute such a negative connotation to the act. Religion is also to blame; it's kind of hard to convince people that suicide isn't totally evil when that has been the status quo for millennia. Instead of focusing on why exactly is the person taking their own life, the 'friends and family' are instead focused on what the act will do to them. If suicide is so immoral and selfish, wanting me to force myself to continue living just so things can remain as they are and you don't feel sad is even more so. I never wished to be born. I don't owe anyone anything. I'm the only one in control of my life and this is my personal decision. I'm not advocating that everyone who is suicidal and even those who aren't just get up and kill themselves, but I wish the stigma was dropped and talking about wanting to end my life wasn't met with such disdain and disgust from those around me. No one is really listening to any of us. They say that they care and they will listen. Those are all lies. There is no support. Only those who wish we just kept our problems to ourselves and didn't disturb the peace. Rant over. I'm tired from working another long shift last night and I'm going to bed.

K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself.

I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff.

340,"Things aren't getting better and I don't know how much longer I can last. I just don't know how much longer I can hang on. I know that I shouldn't be like this but, I can't. Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation. There's nothing there for me and nobody wants me to be there either. I don't even want to be there. I just really want to stick some knives through my stomach and be done with life tbh",behavior

All throughout grade school no one didn't really want to be my friend. Then high school came I thought I was finally making progress, but the friends that I made just drifted away. I usually have fun with my cousins but even then I feel like I just don't fit in like they would just be better off without me there. I feel like an inconvenience for the people around me.

Things were going well during first year until April 2020 when coronavirus hit , a mixture of severe anxiety , depression and stress caused me to be completely overwhelmed and not hand in coursework which resulted in me failing first year and having to retake it again . I feel like a complete failure , everything had been going so well . I haven't told anyone about this and have moved back to my uni house and acted normal with my uni friends during these last few weeks as if I'm still hoping to continue to second year .

I jsut want to die. Then there's the whole layer of more ""normal"" trauma. My family treated me like shit. My mom made me buy a car while I was working a shitty min wage job, and after I got in a few accidents, car insurance. Because even though I was trying to work to pay for my dental treatment.

Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night. I'm sleeping, yet I wake up even more tired of living. They're harsh dreams, of arguments or situations we'd have post breakup. Some of me hopelessly begging for him back, others where he has already moved on with someone new. They are merely dreams I understand, but in my state mentally &amp; physically, they tear me down every night. I feel so stupid for falling this low for a guy.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been. As I'm getting older I've realized my parents have been talking about the future more often. About what college to go to, what my major is, what I want to do with the rest of my life. I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things. I've been busy trying to keep myself happy for a full day ever since quarantine started. My 'friends' have all left me. Usually I would do something that makes me happy but none of those things help anymore. It feels incredibly desolate how the things I've relied on as my mental crutches for years suddenly breakdown and are useless. What do I do guys? I feel so pathetic as a 15 year old kid venting all my pent up problems here. I've read all the posts about real problems. I can't help but feel like this all means nothing. We all die right?

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",ideation

418,"I wish I had friends. I wish I had friends so badly. I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity. As I write this I realize that I don't want to die— I want to live, and my suicidal ideation stems from the shame I have of not being anybody. This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them. I don't know what I am trying to achieve by writing this novel, but if any of you have found yourself in a similar predicament where you don't act on your dreams please give me your advise (especially if you've gotten out of this rut). Sorry I wrote a novel. Tl;dr: I'm lazy as hell and I can't escape my laziness. Seeking advise.",indicator

Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support.

450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

Turns out not everyone lives in constant fear and pain and various states of dissociation). I just don't care. I pour so much love and so much time and energy into caring and then it goes away and I'm left alone with the same familiar will to die. I'm not in immediate danger. If I do it, it'll be at least a few months out. I've made enough plans to look forward to that I've bought that much time, at least. I just know that if I do attempt again, I'm not going to fail. And in the meantime, I guess I'm still trying. I'm always trying.",behavior
478,Another day of being mute. Three hours of lying in bed while bf plays video games in the other room. Everyday is the same. Today I get to wear ugly clothes my mom didn't want and meet my bfs friend for drinks. Nothing to say ever. Graying hair always pulled back. I'm 40 and unemployed. I'm really going to try and kill myself on Monday. Bridge. Can't sleep. No future.,behavior
480,I want to die. I wanna stop hearing my thoughts and feeling this pain. my mind always feels like clutter and I don't know what's wrong with me. I can never get sleep or think straight. yet i've only been diagnosed with depression. I feel like I wasn't supposed to be born. I stick out but not in a good way. I don't know how to undo the mess i've done with my life. I haven't been happy in 2 years now. it just seems like my adulthood is all downhill from here. I don't have any passions or desires i'm not good at anything. I can't even have a normal high schooler job without feeling so much anxiety that I have to quit because I couldn't stop crying. i'm a failure. I don't want to die but I don't want to be me anymore. i'm only 19 and I feel like i've seen enough of my future to want to continue. someone please help me,ideation
481,"Can't take it anymore. I'm a 20 year old with a son, I have no college degree but I did graduate high school. I feel like I failed my son already, I've been working dead end jobs for the past year so I can support him and his mom. I love my son so much but I feel like he'll be better off without me, there's so many great fathers out there and I just wish I could be that for my son. I'm worthless as fuck.

482,"I've made an exit bag. It's also the first time committing suicide has actually really scared me as an idea. I guess I'll just be 100% honest. At 15, I took 120 extra strength aspirin pills. WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",attempt

486,"What about a retirement plan?. I have contemplated suicide for years, I know I am going to do it but I want experience a few more things before I do. im unsure how long that will take maybe in my 20's or 30's. Here's my problem. right now Is a perfect time to start a retirement plan for me. If I wait 10 years I'll never be able to retire. but why should I save up so much money only leaving myself enough to get by if I plan to be dead long before I retire. I'm sorry for the question but I was hoping someone would be able to talk and help me figure it out.",behavior
489,"Living by procrastination. I've just been thinking. Why has it taken so long? If I just put my mind to it I could be dead by the end of the day today. But every day I just get too tired to do the things I need to do, and put it off til later. I've got a side project I'm working on now, which is good for me I think. It distracts from life pretty well. But I just wonder. Fatigue is usually considered the body being out of something, but human bodies are really good at keeping themselves alive. I wonder if the fatigue is actually a defense mechanism. My brain is my body's worst enemy, and I cant off myself if I never leave the house to go buy the gas.",behavior

491,"I'm done and happy. I just got 19. This 2020 August I started my third session at my cegep. I had 9 class by week for a total of 40 hours of class only (95 total hours/week with the estimated time for study + homework + class time, given by the teachers, but I didn't realize it at the beginning). So I try doing school like before but I couldn't keep up, I stop taking care of my hygiene and my hair so they tangle really hard (and I had to cut it later) and my nervous tics came back stronger than before. So after 2 or 3 week, i ask help to the psychologist of the school. First schedule we talk of what happens than 2 weeks later, another schedule, than the next 2 week another schedule, etc until November. During this time I started to cut my rights leg more and more to calm me down (it was the first time in my life that I cut myself by myself). However, he never give me any fucking solutions except at our last schedule(at the end of the sessions) where he basically explained me that I could give up any class and they wouldn't show up in my documents. So that what I did. I gave up 3 class of 9. And I was happy , it felt like a big relief, but I was done with everything. I start faking to go to school. It was easy with online class. I stop responding at my teachers and friends. And I planned to kill myself in the forest in January. But I didn't and still fake it today(of going to school),  but I won't be able to continue. I still have nervous tics, but less than before. I had some fun time with my family, but now it time to stop the lie and end it. I'm not sad or depress. I'm just unmotivated to find motivation and I'm happy at the same time. And this weird feeling didn't change from November. So I plan to hang myself in the highest tree of the forest after cutting off my rights ring finger with an axe. Everything is ready; the rope, the axe and the car",behavior
492,What's the point of living if you're just going to die anyway? It's the dumbest shit ever. I wish I was never born but at the same time don't really want to die. They say life is what you make it but I feel like with that said there still is no point for us being here. We're just like animals with a higher level of thinking which is why we think about all this.,indicator
493,I really need help. Hi. I bought a used pocket pussy and everyone knows about it. I am very ashamed and It's the reason why I started Nofap a long time ago. I can see why it's fucked up I did it and I could even see it then. I let my horniness take over and it's just fucked up. So everyone knows about it and makes fun about me. So I am about to start in a new school but I am afraid of everyone will think of me. They will know about it for sure and it will be everyone's first opinion of me. I know I messed up big time so please don't leave a comment if how disgusting I am. What do I do when peoples first impression of me is that I am disgusting. Thank you. By Anonymous,indicator
