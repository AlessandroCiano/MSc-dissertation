0,Never will find love. Kind of thinking about ending my life again. Work really has been giving me a mental breakdown from the past few weeks. Seems everything in my life is crap even me. I wish I was even attractive enough for someone. I hate being gay and I hate being myself. I want to go to a bridge and jump off.,behavior

5,"whats the point of living. no really. is there any real reason to keep going that cant just be dismissed by ""none of it will matter when you're dead"". all the things that made me want to kill myself are solved and yet i still want to die because now im just left with the feeling that life is all pointless. for a year straight i was constantly thinking about how nothing matters after you die and how life doesnt really matter and even though nothing in particular in my life is making me want to die anymore i still have this feeling that i should do it anyways. but seriously why shouldnt we just kill ourselves if none of this matters and we wont remember anything at all after we're dead. this all just seems like a huge waste of time.",ideation

9,"There is no today, nor tommorrow. I dont have anything days are jujst passing me by, im watching through the window and the earth is moving but me? im in the same place, the day and night cycle keeps on going, and going, and going, and im stuck, stagnant. People do things, but why? they study, work, want to go somewhere in life, but where does the desire come from? I have never experienced that, never. Theres no space for me around these parts, no space. I think i have n incurable disease or something is wrong with my brain, i cant even relate to otehr people that want to shoot their heads off like me. Im damaged. I cant feel nothing ive been falling down this void for like 5 or 6 years and i havent cried once, just once. All i know is that i want to call it a day and kill myself for the sake of my family. Ive seen the way they talk about me and while its not malicius or anything like that its obvious they try to not talk about me. I think theyre gonna be better off without me, everyone is going to be better without me. Im too weird, my face is weird, my demeanor is weird. Honestly i want to die now, right now in this instant if there was a button i could press that would erase all traces of my existence i wouldnt even doubt it, id go for it. But these things dont exist, so either i run towards a cop with a knife or find a dealer with some opioids. i dont know, i wouldnt know, im damaged",behavior
10,"It's not working anymore. I'm a person with schizo-affective disorder. I haven't slept in weeks because all I see and think are people are going to hurt me in my most vulnerable situation. I'm deteriorating. I just want to get it over with. I'm not alone, but I can't tell anyone either. I refuse to be sent back to a mental hospital against my will. The only thing that scares me is the pain if I go through with it. How much it will hurt and how long it's going to last.",indicator
11,"When I encounter new people, in person or online. I always think to myself ""when will they leave?"". Such a fucked up way to feel about a person I barely even know but in my experience no one sticks around. everyone leaves you eventually. Especially the ones who promised they would stay. I start reflecting thinking hmm maybe it's me?. But then I realize I push people away unintentionally because I already have the mind frame of they will leave so it's more like ""let's get this over with"". and the ones who are reluctant to stay I don't necessarily give them a reason to. so shucks, I'd leave too. I'd leave myself if I could so I do not blame these people one bit for making their choice. It starts to hurt less. but at the end of the day, it still hurts.",indicator
12,"i am not ok. not depressed, but if anyone know anything about Erik Erikson, i failed all the development stages that are needed for my age. i am severely codependent, i can't think for myself at all, i need people to do everything for me, i have no sense of self, constant anxiety, self doubt, and mistrust, i feel really small, like a child. this is very unhealthy. i don't know what to do. i can't look for therapy because it is very expensive, and like i mentioned before, i can't do anything myself. i plan to kill myself at 21, whether i want to or not, i'm 18 now. i can see this in everything i do, in everything i am. i can't even talk, and i don't know what else to say because my brain is so empty, people h e to say everything for me. i am so apathetic and passive towards everything, i have no creativity at all. every relationship i have with friends is a parent-child type thing. it's not fixable, there is no hope, i wish there was a reset button on time, but there isn't. i feel braindead. time passes, and it's only getting worse the older i become, and it's gonna be too late to do anything. i should have grown up normally, not start when i'm 18 or even older. i can't do this by myself. i am supposed to be independent by now. not to mention the constant loneliness, because no one wants to be with a person like this. i always need approval and attention, it sucks. i've become anhedonic and dissoative now. i can't be alone, but i'm always alone, so i spend all day everyday on my phone. this is hell.",behavior
13,"I want to die. I don't like anything about myself. I also hate my job and my family. I have all my social media deactivated. I haven't spoken to anyone in months besides ""friends"" who only call me when nobody else will pick up their call. I don't see ANY PURPOSE for my existence. Nobody is getting anything out of this. I am not going to kill myself atleast not any time soon because I have given myself 5 more years just in case. Can someone tell me how to go about existing without feeling anything?I have prolly stopped making sense at this point. But if you can, please temme how because I am sick and tried of crying myself to slee every night.",ideation
14,"It just really bothers me…and I don't really have the guts to do it. I'm on placement at the moment for work, and once these 6 months are over, I do not know what I'm going to do with my life. I don't have the right skills, and I hate that you need references for jobs and you always have to be your best at jobs. I can't seem to do that, I've tried over and over again. Even an interview for me is a struggle. I don't think I can be in this cycle for any longer. For jobs, I'm never good enough and I do need money. I hate how everything is expensive and how housing works in the uk. I cry very easily, I don't know how to stand up for myself when being treated unfairly, I always do get treated unfairly. I hate having to get ready for work even. I'm stuck in this rat race and I feel like the only way out is suicide. I do have other issues, this is my main concern right now as I don't want to struggle with money. I'm just not smart enough and no one wants to give me a reference. I'm not very proactive and my memory is so shit. I have no interest in doing anything. I can't even talk like a professional, I've watched videos and observed but I'm just still not able to. I can't formally answer questions, there's always pausing and it's just so embarrassing. I feel so empty and feel like things are just crushing. I'm getting older, 22 right now and things are just getting harder and harder. It feels overwhelming. I am really scared. I've considered hanging, but I can't seem to go through with it. I post on this few times a month just expressing my thoughts and feelings and how shit this world is. I got belittled by a coworker yesterday. I can never form connections with people and I don't have any friends. I'm not concerned or wanting to make friends, but I feel like it has effect on me. I'm quite awkward and very sensitive. I think about how fucked up this world is…the nasty people, money, jobs, expectations, judgments, people killing people and I think I should just make my escape but I don't have the guts.",behavior

17,"What are you hoping to gain?. For anyone that posts that they are going to kill themselves or are in the process of doing so, what do you hope to gain by posting that information here?

18,"No point in existing. When every thing you do and every word that comes out of your mouth hurts the people that you love there's no point in being alive anymore. I don't mean to hurt anyone. But it seems like every opinion i have, every piece of advice i try to give, just everything that i say or do or think hurts everyone. Im so tired of being alive. I just want someone to love me and accept me and its never going to happen. I want to be brave enough to kill myself but the past two times ive tried ive failed. Im so tired and sad.",attempt
20,"The rage from yesterday has died down. My desire to kill myself has not. Just a thought, but truly, what reason is there to live when what little motivation you have is ripped from your hands, or left to dangle from a string in front of you, just out of reach, teasing you, or brutally destroyed before your eyes? Like, these past few weeks I've done EVERYTHING in my power to try to stay afloat, and it's meant literally nothing. These past few weeks have been the hardest I think I may have ever fought, and yet the recoil from it has hit me in the face even harder. I try, and shit just gets more fucked up. So why bother? Why try when it genuinely makes things worse? And waste your energy in the process? I've attempted an overdose on twice within the past two weeks and three times within the past six months, and I promise you that THOSE experiences combined have been easier to handle than the bullshit I've endured these past weeks. So I mean really? Why try? What's the point? Killing myself is painful, sure. More painful than what I've dealt with though? I'm not so sure anymore. Even if there is a so called light at the tunnel, I don't care anymore. I just want out of that tunnel and if that means getting hit by an incoming train as a means to escape, I'd honestly choose that at this point.",attempt
21,"Help, very worried. I don't know where else to put this but i'm fucking horrified and keep crying and having panic attacks over thinking I have diabetes because I have some of the symptoms. This is also causing me to worry that maybe the diy HRT i'm doing (mtf) is a cause. I can't live without estrogen, i can't wait until i'm a legal adult. Then I think about how many fucking issues I already have and its just too much. I'm going insane what the fuck do I do? My parents would rub in my face about how they were right about me not eating causing me severe issues later on, I'm also scared of being seen weak around them.

23,"Society doesn't like me. People bully me in everywhere. Even on reddit I don't feel comfortable. Definetly something is wrong with me. But I don't know what. Everyday I am thinking about suicide everyday. Everyday I am trying to survive. I am studying learning watching videos daydream a lot. But nothing fills the hole in my heart. I feel lonely I feel like I am only watching other living human beings. I feel like I am on the moon. I am very unconnocted with this world. In the pas I tried to hide this with saying ""I am misanthrope"" but no I wish I could have friends who supports me. I feel like a creature.",ideation
24,"What's the use. I'm just about 22 and over the past 3 years I've dropped out of college and cut almost all of my friends off. I've only decided to keep living only so I wouldn't torment my family but I've given up in life and spend my time drinking and smoking which has made me gain 25 lbs. Haven't gotten laid in a year and a half. There is no hell so I'm not scared to die. I have a plan, note and date which will be in early April. For some life may end up getting better but  for me it doesn't. Good luck to the rest of you",behavior
25,"I plan on going to a hospital and checking myself in to a mental health institution, hopefully forever. The suicidal thoughts have just been too much recently. That and my anger is worse than ever. I'm like a rabid dog in a kennel but I look like I was drawn by a toddler with poor artistic skills given how many cuts I have all over myself. I'm constantly on edge and ready to explode at the smallest inconvenience no matter the situation. I legitimately believe this could one day lead to me being sent to prison because I hurt someone bad. So it's either I walk into an ER and tell them I'm going to kill myself and need to be checked into a psychiatric ward or I actually do go through with it and kill myself. I'm still debating on this and haven't even left home yet. But I think it's best for society if I just stay on the inside the rest of my days. I have no family anyway so no one would care or miss me. How am I gonna pay for all this? Who the fuck knows. I'll probably just end up dead in a gutter one day and get cremated like all the other nameless homeless people out there. But I don't care. If it happens it happens. My name's Ava. And this will probably be my last post ever. Goodbye.",ideation

34,I'm too weak to get rid of toxic people. My best friend hurt me severely and is currently dating my ex. I've posted on Reddit about it and everyone's advice is to kick them both out of my life. I tried at first but we live really close and have an interlapping friend group so I've started seeing him and playing video games with him and stuff. I told him last week that he had two weeks to make things right. It's a stupid ultimatum that I know I'm not gonna be able to stick to. I just want things to be normal and have someone to be friends with. But I know it's never gonna happen and all I'm doing is embarrassing myself and showing how weak I am. I just want him to understand how shitty he's being. He's said he feels bad but won't break up with her so he's probably just trying to keep me around so he's not lonely when they break up.

40,"I hate myself so much. Overall I'm terrible. And I know I'm objective because there are some good things about me, I have a few talents and positive traits. But mostly I'm awful and shouldn't exist and I hate being alive. My life is so disgusting and pathetic. I am such a sad and stupid person. God I wish I was never born. I hate everything. Just the idea of someone knowing what my life is like makes me want to kill myself. I want to kill myself so badly. Where are all these serial killers kidnapping girls? It seems like something could be worked out so that instead of normal happy girls being slaughtered, people who want to die can. Some people are just true wastes of life, and I am one of them. 7 billion people on earth, not all of them can have worth. I wish I had the guts to jump in front of a train so I would be in pieces and you couldn't even tell it was me. And then me and my body would be hidden from everyone. God I am so fucking terrible. And the fact that I'm writing this and the thought of anyone ever reading this knowing I wrote it humiliates me so deeply. I'm so fucked in the head, I just want to crawl out of my skin. And what bothers me more is that if I did kill myself, people I know would pick apart my life to see why I did it. And they wouldn't have to look far. 'Oh my god I can't believe it' would turn into 'oh wow, that's so sad' when taking about me. Not that there are that many people who deeply care about me, for most it would be surface level and then they would go on about their lives since we're not that close. Idk what the rules are here but please don't try to convince me that I'm wrong. Someone want to push me to go thru with it?

43,Recent dental events made eating not fun anymore. I (M23) found out recently I was grinding or clenching my teeth to the point where my back molars look sort of like a y=x^3 graph and now eating doesn't feel fun anymore because I'm worried that it will make my teeth worse. I went to my dentist and said that giving me a night guard is all they can do. I feel so ashamed that I'd let my teeth get to that point. It's mainly because I got too lax on my hygiene because I haven't cared about it when I was more depressed. Now I'm paying the price and the suicidal feelings are coming back. The teeth are in constant pain and it hurts to eat even soft foods. Any dental advice is welcome if anyone here is a dentist.,ideation

Im 35yo male and i know my family and friends would be deverstated just seems no one cares right now. Im not included in anything and when i am, i feel i bring the mood down to a despresive state. I just feel so disconected like im not there im somewhere else dark and cant see. Ive used hotlines and chats online, they do help but short term, i will be alright for that night or a few weeks. They tell me to go to gp which i have and then been refered to the mental health team(im in the uk) but i find them like consending and of no help 'aww thats no good' sounding symphetic 'do you have any hobbies' in a uplifting voice. It just feels so forced so i stopped answering her calls. I know many people will blame themselves when i do  do it and cause so much pain for years to come but at the same time i dont want the existance ive got. I feel like im just rotting away in my flat on my own. I honestly think it would take 2 months before anyone would notice me gone. No one regulary checks on me, i contact them. I spoke to a pyhcolgist few years back not in a proffesional setting someone i knew personally at the time about intrusive thoughts, i asked him when should i be worried and he said whenever i put a plan into an action. Although ive not gone and got a rope it scares me how much ive pushed eveyone who mattered away making it easier to do something, ive also decided i wont do it at home because i wont be found for a while, ive recently decided the woodland where i would do it and how i will leave notes on the paths to warn the dog walkers to go no further and to call the police. Im not stupid im told im bright and quite articular. I know this feeling now is temporary and a mindset, i know some recent events have made me feel this way, i know i wont feel like this in few days/weeks but i also know this will come back around again and i dont want that i want a long term fix. I feel im on the edge im just a tradgedy an argument a taunt away from goin over that edge. My own diagnosis:. I acted out (was a very violent child) screamy and self harm, i would scratch and punch my self in the face and terorise and taunt my siblings and parents. I bullied other kids too. I did see a few phycolgists as a child but i think my whit cheek and cleverness convinced them otherwise. The conclusion was always hes perfectly normal to my parents horror. I think i suffer some sort of phycosis, schizofrenia and i think im bi polar. Does anyone know if this is true; that bi polar can be detected by in balances of hormones in the blood, and schizofrenia can be detected by a test, if so does anyone know how i can force my doctor to do these tests? As i have mentioned all 3 of these never had a diagnosis and ive never been given any meds for them or my dark depresive state. I also dont think  im getting everythink across of how i really feel and go through when speaking to the doctor or mental health team. The help im looking for:. I know that any profesional couldnt give a diagnosis just online or from what i have written and would tell me to seek a profesional but an indication would really help, i think you could be suffering from. Or i think these medications could help you (please only offer meds advice if your from the uk). Also i know i need to change my mindset, does anyone know of any books i could read to change my mindset or find a better way of coping or understanding things. Thanks for reading and any support given. Anyone feeling the same way just talk it does help even if its that stranger on a chat hotline. Everyone else be kind in the world, dont judge anyone even that drug user or thief you never know how they are really feeling or what they have been through to get in that state they're in. Go and be nice to a stranger you never know how much you could make their day just by being nice/kind or even noticing them and giving them a warm smile. Thank you. My name is Tom",behavior

70,"Friend told me she thinks I'm going to die. I really need some advice on how to handle this, as I have no idea what to do. A couple of weeks ago my friend told me that she's positive I'm going to kill myself, and that she'd put a bet on it happening if she could. I didn't know how to respond to this, and told her that. I ended up trying to make a joke of it, then told her I'm doing my best to fight my mental illness, and changed the subject. Since then, it's really played on my mind, and it's not sitting well with me at all. Her words have really hurt me, it feels as though she has no faith in me. If she was just scared that I am going to commit suicide, she could have just said ""I'm scared you're going to commit suicide"" and I could have tried to reassure her. But what she said was brutal. If I'd been diagnosed with cancer, rather than BPD and CPTSD, would she have ever dared tell me she thinks I'm going to die and would bet on it happening? I doubt it. So why does she get to say that? It's so thoughtless and hurtful. It's made me view her differently and I can barely speak to her. She wants to hang out (she's in my covid bubble) and I don't know what to say, because I'll have to tell her how I feel about it and I don't want to have an argument.

I wish so badly for me to get murdered when I walk through sketchy areas every night, but it never works. every single day is the same thing over and over, seeing me screw my life up more, and losing more hope when I thought I had none left. life is so sisyphean and a vicious cycle that never ends, and becomes increasingly difficult to endure. the rare times when I just feel numb to all emotion are alright, but it never lasts long enough and I end up tearing up randomly throughout each day, and then crying myself to sleep. I would give anything to be able to redo the decisions I had made that started this downwards spiral, but since that's impossible, to just end it all so I can stop prolonging my suffering because of my cowardice with killing myself. every day I'm forced to realize how useless I am and how alone I am in the world, both because of what I do and not. I don't know what to do. I literally have a better and more interesting life in my drug induced dreams and that only reinforces how much I want to die.

My parents are wacky hyper-evangelical homeschooler types, and I was raised in a way that wasn't healthy. I worked hard to get a degree and get out of my Appalachian hometown to try to do software engineering. My first job I landed retroactively changed the job description and pigeonholed me into a nightmare role. I landed another job through my very limited connections at my university, but I don't think I can land another. I've started off terribly on the wrong foot. I missed an email, I delayed HR by waiting too long to sign some papers, and now I got assigned to a team today. It's QA, which is not software dev, and out of fear of the same story as my previous company repeating, I cautiously agreed. but my boss pretty much told me he fucking hated me and that everything I've done so far has been wrong (which is true), so I'm on thin ice for acting so hesitant. This was a few hours ago. I sent an apology, and I've hit it of well with my new team, so no problems there. But I have a feeling of dread. I don't think I can land another job. If I lose this, I won't be able to pay rent. I don't have any friends bc I just moved to a new city.

Is it the same as existing? That can't be it. Living is definitely different from existing. But what is living and am I doing it. Have I ever truly lived?. I truly dont know what im doing. Ive pretty much lived my entire life obeying my parents and desperately trying to gain their approval. I dont know what I want out of life. I cant say im looking for a purpose. I dont think life has any inherent purpose. If someone would ask me, I'd say im living for my parents. I dont know what I truly want besides death. Ive always liked the saying ""taking my life"" rather than the other ways of saying it. It gives me power when im in a powerless state. I am taking back my own life and I am refusing to let anyone else take control of me. The thought of myself taking my own life is almost exhilarating to me. It feels like I am just living for someone else's benefit. I feel like education has just been a source of conditioning for me to be exploited when I grow up. Now that Im 18, I realize that I dont really have a full control over my life. I certainly need various forms of sustenance to prevent the degradation of my body. Food, water, warmth, shelter. However in this society all those that are necessary to life will require a form of exchange. I need money but how do I get money? I must work. I must work in exchange to continue to exist. It just feels quite wrong. Am I just lazy? I am able-bodied for labor so that's probably correct, but what about people who are unfit for labor? They need to exchange something for necessities according to how our society functions. Is it the fault of the unfit individuals that they cannot obtain the necessities for life? This feeling of worthlessness in society that some of them feel. Is it justified? But if they choose to attempt to take their own life, they will certainly be stopped. Why? Many people with mental/physical disabilities are ridiculed in our society and when there is no real support in our society and the only other option is to escape thru means of suicide, they are suddenly told that they matter and forced to continue living. The world just seems so sadistic. I want to take my life, but why does someone who has never been in my shoes get to tell me not to do so? Is it not my life to take? Whose is it? Is it God's? If it is not my life to take then is it also not my life to live? I dont know if that's a logical fallacy. Why is it when someone admits that they are suicidal, it often leads to them being forcibly held against their will in a hospital and forced to comply with the authorities? Then when they are released, they are forced to pay for a service they never wanted. Why does everyone want me to live? I have been told many times by my family that I am useless and will never be able to be of significant contribution to society. I am too dumb to fucntion in the real world. So they admit that I will be of no use to society and I agree with them. If i am no use to society, then is it wrong for me to take my life? I know that if I admit to them I am sucidal, they will do whatever they can to stop me. ""Think about the pain you will cause us."" ""Suicide is selfish and will only pass the pain onto someone else."". It's always about someone else. Why is it never about me? Do you not want to take into account my feelings? I am always inclined to think of other people but I dont truly understand my own feelings. I attempted suicide last week without a finalized note because I did not feel my words perfectly captured my feelings. I read the draft and it did not feel like it was my own. The moments leading up to my attempt, the thought of not leaving the note felt like a good decision. I grew up always thinking about what my parents would say. What  will other people think of me? The few weeks before, I drafted my note thinking it was ""the least I could do for my friends and family."" They have done so much for me but when I decided not to leave the note, I felt a small inklet of freedom. ""I dont have to explain why I wanted to take my life when they never listened to me."". (Un)fortunately my attempt had failed and I am back to this never-ending cycle of insanity and hopelessness. For the past few days after my attempt, I had indulged in some minor and temporary pleasures, but i am yet again back to square one.",attempt

I'm 19 years old. Some of these are suicide attempts but the most recent one just doesn't make any sense. The first one came when I was 16. I went to CVS, bought a couple bottles of 30 unisom sleeping pills, and swallowed every single one. A few hours later my dad saw my suicide note and took me to the hospital while I was still awake and in perfect physical condition. When I got there I lied and said I only took 6 for attention, I thought that they wouldn't notice that way. They didn't, because all of my vitals were fine, and I fell asleep on time at a mental institute that night (In my state legally if you even think about hurting yourself you have to get committed. Next one was in November 2020. I took my straight razor, put in a brand new blade, and sliced hard and fast across my neck from artery to throat to artery. It barely penetrated the skin and a few days/showers later it was like it never happened. No scar. Next was also in November 2020. I took every prescription in the house, made a cocktail, and survived. Basically the same exact situation as the first attempt. Here's the one that really made me scared, it's like I just don't die. I was on my motorcycle and went too fast around a corner. [Here's a picture of the aftermath of the bike for context. ](https:/imgur.com/a/t3wtioV) I was at around 50-60mph when my rear tire lost traction and spun out from under me. I went over a curb at a slight angle. By the time my bike hit that mailbox me and the bike were sideways. 1. That mailbox didn't even have a scratch on it. If I hit it a few more inches to the left, I would've been crushed along my side between a 430lb bike flying at 50mph and some fucking indestructible  mailbox. 2. If that mailbox wasn't there to stop the bike as soon as it hit the curb (and sort of slingshot me into the direction of the sidewalk), I would've been aiming straight for a waist-high, spiked, metal fence. 3. I couldn't have hit the ground more perfectly. I landed on my side so the elbow and shoulder pads in my protective jacket absorbed most of the force from the initial impact onto the pavement. From there I just rolled in the direction I landed 4 or 5 times. If I had hit the ground at any other angle, that would've caused me severe or permanent injuries at the very least. The cops and paramedics were the ones who were telling me that stuff while I was doped up on more adrenaline than I thought a person can feel. They deal with this shit for a living and they were still confused as fuck about how I was perfectly fine. After the tow truck came one of the paramedics dismissed it as my adrenaline numbing the pain and told me I should go to the hospital. I said no and was fine anyways. I had a tiny hole in my gloves that I bled through a little. Other than that I'm perfectly fine.",attempt

112,"Feeling bad about seeking help. I'm making this post because I feel bad about seeking help and I am not sure how to proceed. I have a long history of depression and suicidal thoughts, even to the extent that I have attempted suicide in the past (many years ago). I believed I was past it all, but this year has pushed me back down and I've begun having those thoughts again. I have some chronic medical issues which cause me massive amounts of pain, to the point that I can hardly move and I can't even get dressed on my own. (I'm not even 30 years old and I can't dress myself) For a while I tried to keep the pain, both physical and mental, to myself. Yesterday, I finally broke down and told my wife that I need help. She has been EXTREMELY supportive, and has helped me set up appointments to get help. Whether or not I follow through is another thing, but I am going to try. Now here's the specific issue I'm seeking help with: I appreciate my wife's support in all of this, but there are certain aspects that I really don't want to talk to her about, specifically the stress caused by my medical issues. I have spoken to her and we decided it might be a good idea to speak to one of our shared/close friends about it because this person has also has/had severe medical issues. This friend is trustworthy and extremely kind-hearted, so we have no doubt that it would help at least somewhat. Even after talking to my wife and having her support, I still feel terrible about it. I feel like a piece of crap for not being able to confide in her about this, especially when I'm willing to talk to another friend about it. It almost feels like emotional cheating, and I feel bad because my wife has already told me she feels powerless to help (despite everything she's done to help thus far).",attempt

Probably you find yourself daydreaming about if only you had a bf/gf things would be different. Probably your parents weren't so fond of you or they loved you too much in a harmful way. Probably you thought of drugs or alcohol to alleviate some stress. But the truth is that you are frightened of the idea, even the suicidal thoughts are a cope, just another distraction, another way for you to trick your mind into fantasy and inaction. You will never do it so calm down, rejoice to the fact that you are a coward and even suicidal courage and determination to get on with it are more unbearable than the act itself. Everyone hates themselves, and those that don't, they don't truly love themselves either, it's just a prolonged status quo they maintain figuratively like a sedative to not be self-aware. If you change your mind and you want to do it, don't be modest about it, don't go silently into the night. Go out with bang, and big flames.

177,"Don't take the pills. I'm not here to police you. I'm not here to tell you to not commit suicide. However, I do want to clear something up. Overdosing is not a peaceful way to die. Many people think that overdosing means taking a few pills, sleeping and then. that's it. Life over. Nope. It is one of the worst things you could ever do. Firstly, overdoses usually take 24-42 hours to take effect. Lots of time to regret your decision. Secondly, the liver damage is not worth it. Most overdoses do NOT result in suicide. But they do often result in permanent liver damage. This will never go away and its so easy to do. But let's say you do end it with pills, what will that be like? You'll feel fine for a day or so. Then you'll start vomiting because your liver is trying to get rid of the substances. Depending on what you overdose on, you'll either be vomiting all the time. And this will be the most acidic gross vomit you could imagine. Or doing a mixture of vomiting and letting out black urine as your body tries to save you. A few hours later, you'll become jaundiced and start having liver failure. Your heart beat will increase, you'll have horrible stomach pains, your liver will slowly die. Then that's it. Don't take the pills.",indicator

200,"A short long story. Hello all,. I have been struggling with depression for a really long time like since 2nd grade and jts only increased since then. I am currently 19 and my life is going absolutely shitty. My mom and dad both passed away (Mom going on 4 and dad going on 5), I was mentally and physically abused by my mother (yet have no hatred for her) I know she was my mother and the things she did was not ok, but she herself was struggling with multitude of mental illnesses. And my dad was cut out of my life since I was about 11-12, my mom died due to sleep apnea and an enlarged heart, while my father died from a car accident. They were both separated andI miss them very much. anyway continuing on. The first time I tried committing suicide was when I was using a phone charger since I couldn't find rope, and felt hopeless. After attempting, I ""vowed"" that I would just join the military and die in combat, but after moving in with my aunt and uncle that soon changed. Everything seemed to be going well, I was doing well in school and even though I still hated myself it seemed to be going very well. I had friends and family tell me that I was the strongest person they knew and that they always had my back no matter what. But I realized that everything I earned was just mooching off the support and love of everyone else. I only passed highschool and got into college because of them pushing hard, but as soon as college hit it went downhill faster than you can say Oui. My grades went to shit, and my mooching was over. My work ethic lost its way and currently may lose my job. I have multiple attempts on my life but every time I always think of the pain it would put my family through. It gets harder everyday and recently I was arrested with possession of shrooms (which is a felony where I'm from) and spent 2 nights in jail, now the only way to keep it from getting worse is to get my grades up which is impossible bc of all the class and homework I have missed. I don't really talk about my feelings, and I lie every time someone asks me if I'm ok or how I'm feeling. Its mentally exhausting and its getting to the point where my death seems to ultimate answer to bring my family closer, where all I caused was problems and drove everyone away. After moving on campus my aunt and uncle's family is getting better now that I am gone. I also recently began searching about ways to kill myself and find it too look like an accident but I can't really find anything besides the hotlines.

I have a long distance friend who's vey kind and doesn't yell, doesn't condemn or demean me. Recently he's even found out much more how terribly anxious nihilistic and self destructive I can be. I've been wondering if I should tell him how much I've been thinking about partially planning to die. I don't want to bog him down with all of my garbage. I fear how much I'm already doing that.

Everyone dies eventually, I really don't see the point of stressing over keeping an average A in my classes, passing my physics test which I always struggle with and barely pass no matter how hard I try, laughing with my friends is nice but it only lasts for a while. If I'm not working I'm playing games, and although that makes me happy for a bit right after I feel empty because I could have been spending my time working, or doing schoolwork. I'm an aethist so I imagine death is just like sleep which seems amazing. Eternal sleep? Sign me up please. I'm not afraid of death either. One night while I was returning home from work someone tried to rob me with a knife and I imagine in these situations I would scream and beg that he doesn't kill me but I felt really calm. I told him to fuck off and walked away and he didn't follow me. Only thing that's stopping me is that imo suicide is selfish. My parents just got me a dog. Whos gonna take care of him? The person that loves me would feel horrible cause she doesnt have a clue. I also have to wish her a happy birthday. All the depressing and self-depricating jokes I make, what if my friends think I was being serious and feel like they could have helped. My parents have given me so much and they don't have a clue I feel this way, next morning I'm dead? wtf kinda return is that. ""Thanks mom and dad for supporting me and allowing me to be (at least to society) 'successful', I present to you a dead son"". My best friend of 8 years would be so confused. His mom has cancer, he wants to become an NBA player and he keeps a positive outlook, yet me on the other hand have barely any problems and think that suicide would be better. Not sure how to collect my thoughts so I kind of went on a rant. Any advice? Its obviously not normal for me to be having suicidal thoughts when nothing is necessarily going wrong.",ideation

I have other issues going on like social anxiety &amp; seasonal depression and all of this just adds to the fire. But for some reason I feel like i'm doing it for attention. I research for easy painless ways to kill myself, I could have these thoughts for days, and then be fine for the rest of the week. Which makes me feel like i'm faking it. The only things that trigger me is when my parents call me lazy, and say nothing to my brother who literally does not do anything just because he's a boy.

I'm glad she's not suffering anymore, but I can't shake the pain from it. I have so many questions and so much doubt about myself regarding what happened. She called me the night she did it from a restricted number. I didn't answer it because my ringer was off and when I checked my phone later I had no idea it was her. It didn't occur to me until days later. Some days, it makes so little sense to do something like that. To willingly and voluntarily end your own life goes against that ingrained desire to against all odds survive. But then other days, like today it doesn't feel that far-fetched. It actually feels like it would be a welcome end to everything. I wouldn't say that I suffer from depression, because I don't actually meet the clinical criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. I've actually been in therapy for over a decade overall and going on 7 years with my current therapist. I asked her last week what my diagnosis would be. She mentioned my specific phobia/anxiety. She ruled out OCD and wasn't willing to stick a diagnosis of GAD on my based on all she knew. I've struggled with a fair few things over the course of my adult life, including an aborted attempt at suicide 6 or so years ago. Obviously the fact that I'm here now means that it didn't work, and in general I've felt thankful that it didn't. But now I find myself in a different place. When I think about what the rest of my life will entail I'm neither particularly excited about to put off by it. I certainly don't want to feel the way I feel right now anymore, but I think if I just put my head down and force myself forward eventually I'll stop caring about all of the things that won't ever come to be. I know that over time, I'll get used to the way things are, and the way I feel and that I'll settle into a sort of content existence. That raises the question, if I'm not particularly drawn one way or the other, why bother going through all of it? I've given this some good thought and consideration, and at the end of the day it really comes down to my parents. However little I think I'm worth as an individual I won't dispute that my parents do infact love me a great deal, and I think the idea of them losing two children to suicide would break them.

254,"REASONS WHY IM GOING TO END IT. I just feel like shutting down and my mind and thoughts just go straight to wanting to end it. I'm sick of being epileptic the headaches the paranoia the overthinking the sleepless nights i havent had a full night sleep since forever body dysmorphia anorexia melancholic mind the recklessness brain fog inability to concentrate on normal daily tasks. Starting with my childhood. I was Not a typical child. I dealt with developing Selective mutism and living inside my brain. I Constantly had inner monologues, inner narratives and very broad imagination and creative mind i used to stay at home alot reading my grandfathers books while kids were playing outside and I hated going to school and i hated the educational system and being indoctrinated to the mundane ways of learning was more than boring for me. at school i would act as thewallflower. And id be invisible ironically many students teachers recognize my abilities remembered me but i never did i wasnt included in that environment mentally. And i believe that learning should be solely  with self autonomy. Going back to another key point. Long before school happened it all started at home. My family are very conservative they have rejected any idea that doesnt suit their limited scope of things thats why i leaned towards my grandfather who was more open. Home is where i felt very neglected gor instance in comparison to my older sister who was incredibly extroverted and somehow shadowed my presence not ofc her fault snd also the fact that my youngest sister who is seemingly mentally ill ( lack of o2 birth caused her brain damage) her condition is very rare she needed the most care from my parents and as a result i was looked over that i seemed normal therefore i didnt need guidance consequently being  outcasted and sent to coventry ( lack of developing functional social skills)  and for that i was ostracized from an early age those sinking feelings of loneliness seemed to grow with me. My parents They never pushed me to talk and i was always yelled at by my teachers and my parents to fit in. I didn't speak for almost 15 years. It was a comfortable safe place for me but also a living nightmare. I recall experiencing a car crash with my dad and i was the one who was harmed he never took me to the hospital he took me to school and i was left traumatized  and i still have nightmares of being hit until today. They even took my cat and never let me have a cat i want my cat back. I remember a teacher that had long nails and she poked my right eye unintentionally and for that i lost vision in that eye and my parents never intervened nor complained to the administration. Bullying trauma ( physical sand mental abuse) deteriorated my mental and physical health being an easy target outside of a group with little to no support system i received  no empathy no interventions i cried myself to sleep then wakeup tl go to through the exact same hell in where i would be harmed mercilessly again my parents neither school helped me in any way possible. Eventually i started to hear negative voices and the constant state of stress led me to be diagnosed with epilepsy and i would be hospitalized when I get the flashbacks and have mental breakdowns. My deceased grandfather was the only person who was keeping alive. The absence of this great figure. His death was also a part of my trauma. And me developing a sense that everything everyone dear to me will leave me  ( strong feelings of abandonment and resistance to that matter) i know that death is inevitable but i never seem to accept it i would do anything to spend just a second with him. This paralyzing fear of abandonment  lead me to wall myself to avoid being hurt. It's also horrible to feel like you only have a single person who's remotely keeping me going and when theyre gone.youre gone. Rejection of dreams /lost dreams opportunity to study engineering in malysia and i had a complete scholarship it was for me a new start but my dad rejected it after me finishing all the papers at the last moment( his premise is that girls aren't allowed to live alone / wouldnt help me financially ). The crippling depressives reaction caught me off guard suffocated me with my evil thoughts. At that moment I realized that life is a continuation of a series of mental breakdowns Life is miserably unfair  Its not even sad its down right infuriating. I started Taking pain killers and antidepressants that were prescribed to me earlier secretly to cope with those racing thoughts and after that it led to my addiction to use paracetamols. In result It damaged my liver my digestive system and i would puke everytime i eat so i starve my self and my body rejects food that days pass with me eating one small meal and cups of water and i managed to disturb the normal process of healing. I didn't succeed to study masters because im an absolute failure I lost every friend i had i wish i was good enough. I failed miserably. I had come to realize my inability to accept my ordeals. I never deserved anything. I always sabotage the gifts. And 'that's lifeas funny as it may seem Some people get their kicks Stomping on a dream'",ideation

I've done a lot of vaguely suicidal stuff in my life but only in the past year or two has anything that's genuinely bothered me afterwards happened. So there are really only two events I struggle to categorize. Both were extremely similar in form, but the thought behind them was different. The first I really wouldn't categorize as an attempt. I was really just testing my method. I went until shortly before the point of no return and stopped. Just to see if it really worked like it was supposed to. The second time I don't really know what to think of. I went in with the intention of dying. I expected to not have the courage to go through with it. I had hoped that in the moment the fear would be less strong than I expected and I'd just do it. Much like the first time I stopped myself. Both of these happened long enough ago that I feel somewhat separated from them. I'm in a tenuously better situation right now but this question has been weighing on me a little bit.

I've been trying for a long fucking time. But no. People tell me to give it time and all that bs but none of that is real talk. I really want to die. Every time I get my hopes up for anything it just hurts even more when I eventually fail. I wish I knew how to kill off my emotions. So that I could be satisfied with whatever dirt is given to me. My childhood was the fucking worst. Thats probably why I'm so fucked up now. I was bullied by friends and beaten by my parents. It has shown me that no human being is to be trusted. Not even friends and family because they will betray you and hurt you if you don't submit to them. I can't trust myself either. I am the one ruining my own life afterall. And I've done some terrible shit too. I bullied other kids just to make myself feel better. I am just like the friends and family that I'm talking about. I probably deserve to suffer. But why don't all my ""friends"" suffer too then? Maybe I should fucking make them suffer myself. No girl has ever wanted me either. And I know, its embarrasing that I'm crying over pussy. But its more than just pussy to me and its not as easy to get a girl for me. Other people care more about my virginity than I do and they used to make fun of me for it. So I had to start lying about it to all my friends. Because friends are fucking manipulative parasites. You only need them because you would suffer from loneliness without them. But with them you have to at least act like you fit in or you'll get bullied. A girl actually liking me is basically just a fucking joke at this point. How I wish I was asexual so I didn't need to deal with them. Family means nothing. You exist just because two people decided to fuck. Sure they love me. The beatings I got were out of discipline too. I'm sure my dad had a good thought when I was 8 and he beat me with his belt every time I failed to tie my shoes. So should I be thankful? Should I also be thankful that they will cut me out of their lives in the future for not believeing in their dumb made up brainwash religion? Unconditional love my ass. Its only unconditional as long as you submit. Well I'd rather die than submit to anyone. Friends, family, girls, whatever the fuck. So what do I have to live for? Family? Oh you mean the people who forced me to exist and then didn't know how to raise me? Friends? You mean the people who bullied me and who pressure me to be someone I don't wanna be? Love?

When people aren't open, there is no learning experience, because ghosting doesn't tell you much about the situation unless you can figure it out on your own, and I mainly don't figure a thing out except to get more paranoid. Some people get ghosted looking for sex, and I'm not looking for that, and it makes me feel even sadder to not be looking for it. I just want to have some human connection. Honestly, most sex I've had was to try and have someone that felt they couldn't just leave me as easily. This is not a plea for attention, or at least not one that is a hope for salvation, just a warning. All that comes from places like this subreddit is people that feel saying ""don't kill yourself"" does something in itself. All that does is tell the person to wait for help that isn't coming. Saying that a person is dealing with a temporary problem or that things get better is sadistic when things tend to get worse. I'm so bad at life that I'm terribly scared of how to accomplish death. I don't want my head to explode via shotgun, because my father died without a funeral and I think for some people a closed casket is worse than an open one.

I've looked into other options, but they're even scarier - I think of Mark Linkous overdosing, but waking up paralyzed from his leg oxygen being cut off. A failed suicide that leaves you unable to attempt again is the worst fate. This is all while my body is continuously accompanied by death. I'm nowhere close to dying, but the health issues I have make me so much lower than what I would consider a living person. Every morning I wake in pain, and most of the day is depression and physical pain, until the night that I spend in high anxiety about what dreams would come if I fall asleep, or maybe I'm just afraid of the people who rape you when you're vulnerable.

The thing that made me completely lose it angry, upset and completely done with the world was my parents locking the kittens in their bedroom with them so they wouldn't sleep on my bed at night. Because of COVID I had to collect and take care of their new kittens for a couple of weeks before I came home to visit them (support bubble). As a result of nearly 3 weeks of taking care of them alone, they're quite attached to me. I planned to spend a week here (booked annual leave and everything) and I feel like I was naive to think that my parents would actually be interested in spending time with me with the kittens around. Anyway, they don't even make an effort to spend time with the kittens and then they get jealous and annoyed that the kittens want to be near me. They're currently locked in my parents bedroom with no access to water or a litter tray and it's just made me so angry. Am I allowed to be angry? Why has this situation pushed me to crying in the garage at 3am because I'm being made to feel guilty for doing them a favour and trying to fight the urge to go wandering off into the night because I give precisely zero shits what happens to me right now. I almost hope something bad happens to me because at least I wouldn't have to wrestle with the thoughts. It would just be over.

315,I wish I could die and I hate my parents. Why do I feel this way? My life is okay. I live with my parents and they have money to support me. We have a nice house and I can get things I want. I have 2 dogs who I love sooo much. I would worry about them if I died. I'm in college (not doing so great) but set to graduate in 2 years. Once I graduate I can get a job and move out. I hate my parents sometimes. I mean I love them. I would die for them. I would miss them if they were far away. But at the same time when they yell at me I wish I could curl up and die. They yell over the smallest things. It's completely unpredictable. They don't usually yell at me for bad grades but will yell if I get hair on the floor. I think my mom has OCD. I know they love me. I know they love me a lot. But they can't stop yelling. I think they can't help it. I think the only way I might be able to get them to stop is if I was perfect. If I got perfect grades and kept my room in pristine condition. If I helped out more around the house. I'm sure they would still yell but probably less. I just can't make myself do it. It feels like an effort just to get up in the morning. Some days I don't get up until afternoon. I feel like a failure. I am a failure in some ways. I need better self control. I have anxiety and depression. I take adderall and Paxil and it helps so much. I'm no longer afraid to talk to people and I can do my schoolwork. But just when I think I'm okay I'm not. I believe in God but sometimes he feels so far away. Thank you for reading this. I just needed to post. I have no one to talk to.,ideation
316,"Nsfw. So uh. ever since I was younger I've had a bad porn issue, one of those kids who had like a ton of porn downloaded on their phone, etc etc. I dislike it to say the least, even to this day, I dislike the roles it plays in my day to day life and find myself being disappointed in myself. That issue is something besides what i'm talking about now but it helps set the idea. My girlfriend has cheated on me multiple times and for some reason I'm still with her. I don't wanna think or talk about that with anyone but it started another porn addiction. For some reason I sometimes masturbate as some coping method, like whenever I feel like shit i'll go to my phone and looking for that. I hate it, recently I just felt disgusted, how disgusting it is and how disgusted and hateful I felt towards myself. How ugly I felt from what she did and I just kept thinking about wanting to kill myself. I ended up masturbating to the thought of killing myself and ended up climaxing. Terrible feeling and I just wanted to get it out of my head, sorry you had to read this, nasty",ideation

A few months ago i felt numb and empty inside and while my girlfriend was out on a walk i used that chance to try to relieve some of the pain and when she got back of course she saw my arm and freaked out. We got into a conversation into some of our friends in person and some of them just started laughing telling my girlfriend ""why are you dating an attention seeker? she's got a better life then most people you should dump her and go for someone who isn't cutting for the attention"" which honestly for a few days i cried myself to sleep in her arms. K (the Gf) was talking about everything that was going on with a friend and instead of comforting her giving her advise he proudly said ""I BET SHE'S LYING SHE DIDN'T CUT SHE'S FAKING IT SHE'S A FAKE CUTTER"" with everybody reading the chat with the guy then encouraging K to kill herself.

319,"Considering going to the hospital for suicidal ideation but have no insurance until the 1st of February. So I've hit one hell of a depressive spell. I have bipolar 1 and have been dealing with it's symptoms for at least 7 years now. Due to the virus and having two jobs, all of my usual coping methods have been tossed out the window. I'd usually do some painting, focus on small simple daily goals, and make sure that I'm in public most of the day just to have some kind of minor human interaction. None of which are things I can do right now. So I'm kind of spiraling worse. I'd rather, you know, go to the hospital than act on my suicidal thoughts at this point and while I don't think I'm a danger to myself at this point that can change. I've tried reaching out to friends and family, but there hasn't been much in the way of help. My sister said that I was just whining after a while of venting to her and said I needed to think of some practical solutions that I could do now and stop talking about things I can't change. And my parents told me to focus on the positive. The only reason I haven't gone to the hospital or looked for some kind of medical care is that my insurance doesn't kick in until the 1st of the month AND I started a new job as a part time teacher. I've been working there two weeks and if I peace out with no explanation that's gonna make everything worse for the staff. And if they let me keep working there it's gonna be a fucking nightmare to pick up the class after that. Soooooo the hell do I do? I guess I could just wait for the 1st, but that's gonna be a long wait in depression time scales. I don't wanna go broke and I don't wanna come home and have everything falling apart.

Nobody really liked me when I was little. I was constantly bullied and even most of my teachers encouraged others to abuse me. My mom hates me and made it clear that she loves her boyfriend more then me, since she always threatens to get rid of me whenever we argue. The people in family who loved me, friends who like talking to me and even a handful of teachers who actually believed me, are gone now. Those friends have disappeared, those people in my family are dead and, there's no chance of getting those teachers ever again. Not to mention, my other relatives and cousins forgot I existed long ago and they didn't even like me. As you can see, most people want me dead. Through all if this, I'm lucky to have found two friends who do care about me, for whatever reason. Though one of them might be dying and the other one is always super busy (I don't blame them for it. It just sucks that we can't do much). However, they're both doing online school and I don't have anyone else to talk to. Neither of them exist during the week so it's just me. I don't mind being alone but, I need to be completely alone to feel be okay. When I'm alone and around people, only bad things happen to me and my thoughts aren't kind. I really can't get that though. Considering I am only a senior in high school and I'm on the younger side so I have a good year or two before I can do anything. I know I need to be away from the people surrounding me but, like I said, I can't do anything. I tried going to the school but they made things worse. My mom doesn't care enough to put me through therapy (well, as long as she can't listen to what I say and what I say. Which is obviously something a therapist can't really do, since it's not allowed in their job). I would do it myself but I don't have money or a job. Things wouldn't be so hard if my mom and her bf didn't make fun of me for everything I like and do. God forbid I make them aware of my two friends, they'll drive them away and lie to make them hate me. I know I'm not perfect and have made mistake but, constantly pushing my friends away isn't fair. I don't think I deserve that. As you can see, I don't have much to live for. I love my two friends dearly and I'd hate to put them through that but, I just don't know what else to do. Living a whole year when you know you need help and that something's wrong with you, is unbelievably hard. I honestly didn't think it would get this bad. I promised myself that if things don't get better. I can kill myself on graduation night. Even if I do live that, I still don't want to attend graduation.

Talking my mind to everyone, Prozac, doing new things with myself, trying new foods, making new art, and so much more I can't even list them all. Nothing, nothing changes. My mental battle started with the memories, replaying of us in my head everywhere I go. The thoughts, the damn thoughts of 'if I only did this differently' or 'will he give me another chance?' Then came the dreams. They started out as happy ones, a time where we are still together, cuddling and goofing around as we used to. The thoughts started coming back again, but I was asking 'Why couldn't I have just been what he wanted?' 'I'll never be what he wanted.'. This had been cycling over and over, with worse thoughts each time. I started Prozac in December. As of the last few months, the god damn dreams have been eating my mind every night.

He tells me about how he hated being in college but was lucky enough to meet people and develop a social life to help him get through. He says to me that he probably would have dropped out if he didn't meet those people. How am I supposed to respond to that? Wow congratulations on being lucky enough for that to happen while I'm over here commuting and not talking to a single person every day. He doesn't even have to try to socialise. Girls always start talking to him first. It's demoralising hanging around with him. College is a goner for me at this point. I've fucked up majorly for the second time.

388,"I'm so stressed about the future. Just trying to get myself to study for exams without bawling is incredibly difficult. My mental health over this school year has been bad to say the least. I haven't talked to anyone but one person besides my parents, on occasion. I've had a myriad of missing assignments that I haven't done yet; it's a miracle i have a C- in my worst classes. Now I'm seeing all the missing work I didn't do and I've realized I can't turn them in 'per the syllabus' that I didn't read that said no late work anymore because we did our last test. Don't even get me started on my AP Biology exam on Thursday. I haven't been paying attention at all for the past semester, and my C- is literally based off of me using quizlet on every test. I don't want to do this anymore. I know that it's only 2 weeks. It'll be all over by then. But, it's so hard. I just had my other AP exam last Thursday and all I remember is studying and crying myself to sleep. It's terrible that I'm finally considering suicide when throughout the whole year and some change, I never thought about it. I honestly wouldn't give a shit if it weren't for my parents. They just expect this greatness in me; I can feel it even though they never vocalize it. They both know I'm smart, and I do too. They just don't know how fucked up my head is and has been.

I DONT KNOW, OKAY? That's something that I've wanted to tell everyone for a while. I'm confused. I haven't ever thought about such hard things.

390,"vent. After swearing i wouldn't, I'm back on this subreddit lmao. Also I'm fine,safe. I've never actually attempted suicide despite wanting to, is a lot harder than I want it to be. here's to hoping nobody judges me and thinks I'm attention seeking 🤞. uh so the original title was 'is verbal abuse a thing?'. well I know it's a thing but everyone I've talked to thinks It doesn't affect me and that I'm overreacting. yesterday, I realized that my parents are no longer a good support system for me. But I think I've been denying how bad they actually hurt my mental health rather than help? I moved in with my grandfather. And my uncle and his partner, who I RARELY TALK TO. But something immediately struck me. and it was so surreal. the mom and dad that I have loved and trusted for so long, hurt me in a way that now, I feel like I don't want to talk to them ever again. I left to go live with my grandfather, because of a family death but also because living with my parents was too much. I've lived here for a month, and what my mom said when I asked if I could go home shocked me. She said not until you ____, and then she asked why, well I told her because I don't feel good, and she said idk what that means, and I told her I needed to go back on medicine, and she said you need to work through it there, and she said you cancelled your services here(I'm in a program for people with disabilities to help get a job, but I no longer live in that area, so I cancelled them, they also weren't working for me. it didn't have anything to do with our conversation). So I didn't say anything, and I blocked her. I didn't tell anyone cuz I didn't want to worry them, so I called several hotlines, but I knew there was nothing they could do so I hung up, and started crying. Then I was like maybe I should just sleep, since I hadn't slept in 20 something hours. but the weirdest thing happened. My aunt-in-law, who I rarely saw and I rarely spoke to before coming to live with them, came to talk to me(I'm assuming she heard me crying, I hate how thin walls can be honestly lmao). But she told me all these things, she opened up to me about her past, she told me I was an amazing person and the world needed me because I've gone through things and I could help other people going through things too. She told me that ever since I got here everyone has been happier, she told me no one needed me more than the people here, she told me I would always be welcome here. This was such an out of body experience for me. Why did this shock me? Am I delusional? Why is it that this woman I've barely spoke to was able to say 'you're always welcome here' vs my own mom, who hurt me so much that I wanted to leave in the first place, said 'not until you finish _____. Why' when I asked to come home, and BLAMED me for something I did that I honestly didn't think would have any effect on anyone but myself, and did it because it wasn't helping me in the first place. I remember my sister telling me why she moved out(because of our parents) and I remember thinking she was being ungrateful but now I realize maybe I've been blind to how they've been treating me. I know they have good intentions but everything they say is like they're holding a grudge against me, they always argue with me and then tell me I'm the one who starts them, then they ask me why everything turns into an argument, then they ask why I never talk to them except when I want things. I've tried my hardest, I walk on eggshells just to not upset them, im so polite when I speak to them, I ignore things they say that hurt me just to not get in an argument. It's true I never talk to them, because when I do I feel like killing myself. They always seem to be mad at me about something, when I tell them why im upset they always tell me it's because of something I did or am not doing. when I tell them they're doing something that hurts me they get defensive and tell me it's something they're doing because of what I did. i know if I had the guts to kill myself I would, but I don't. The people I loved most in this world hurt me more than anyone. and I haven't had irl friends since I graduated in 2019. I've always had internet friends, but due to recent events I decided people hurt me too much and I don't need anyone. Which ended up making them hate me, so now all I have is my family here. Over the years it's been getting increasingly harder for me to form bonds with people, and be scared of losing them. I feel like once everyone I care about dies, that's the end. I'll have no one to depend on and no other reason to live, because the things that made me happy in life were the people I loved. and I guess I'm dying alone too, probably homeless because I don't have a job, or a drivers license, severe anxiety, can't maintain relationships. All this time I just wanted people to see my worth, to appreciate me, and to want to be in my life. I know life is good, but only when you're in a good situation. My situation isn't bad it's just that I'm at a dead end. There isn't really anything beyond this life but ups and downs. I'm not going to accomplish the things I want to do. I've gone my whole life clinging to 3 main interests so I didn't waste my time on things that weren't worth it, cuz I'm time conscious lol. idk. I stopped venting online and to people in general because there wasn't anyone who actually wanted to listen. Everyone ended up telling me to stop venting, get some professional help, that no one wants to be my friend because I'm so negative, so now It takes a lot out of me to vent to anyone, which previously I would just do with no hesitation, even if I was trauma-dumping. This is probably a bad idea cuz probably no one will read this or give any helpful advice. Or maybe like last time everyone will just tell me to kill myself. either way it's whatever. My life doesn't suck there's just no point to it, I guess that's true for everyone's life, there's no point to anything unless we make one.",ideation

400,"What happened to me. So this all happened 7 months ago now. I'm 17 years old by the way. I went to a friends lake house in April and i went on a tire swing that's only around 2 feet off the ground. I fell straight on my back and nothing really different after. That night I felt very sick and tired, but none of my major symptoms yet. 2 days later I'm home again. Feel a little off, and my head is very foggy and fuzzy. About a week passes and I see my normal doctor and she immediately says 'Concussion'. As symptoms stay the same, I then see a neurologist who says It's post concussion syndrome. But the thing is I never had any of the 'Normal' concussion symptoms, only the fogginess. So I'm still feeling bad and stuff so then I go see a chiropractor who doesn't resolve anything. Near the end of summer I golfed a lot to try to relax, but I couldn't. So then things started to get worse, my head wasn't the foggy, it felt like I had hot water inside my head. And it was extremely uncomfortable. So then I started seeing a naturopathic doctor who was in natural medicine. He believes he can fix all of my symptoms. Also I got a MRI, x rays and ct scans of my back, neck, front. So then I started seeing a concussion clinic and I stopped going because nothing was helping. My mom suggested CBD oil so I started to take that and it didn't help. It made things worse, I was extremely inflamed in my head. Later on I start seeing a naturopathic doctor who suggest I see a couple vision doctors and there was no red flags. I also got a neurotransmitter test.

Also I had super high cortasal level. And he said it's almost like I got chased by something for it to be that high. Symptoms Include :. Face gets all tight. Neck gets really stiff. Temples get tight. Hot water and Moving/zapping feeling all around for head and temples. Laying head on anything, symptoms worsen and head moves around as I lay against anything. Itchy around eyes. Things get worse when I sit down. Itching inside head. Middle of back moving as I lay against anything. My most uncomfortable symptom is my head being super inflamed and hot. And moving.

I've been discharged from the military for psychological reasons and sent to a psychiatrist for evaluation. She diagnosed me as sociopath and self mutilation. For the past month I've been contemplating suicide. Because I don't  get any joy out of life. I don't feel love for anyone I lie constantly. And hurt others for no reason. I got engaged last summer to a girl that annoys me constantly and the only reason I don't end with her is because of habit and she really cares for me. But a month ago I reconnect with a girl I used to date. And since the last time I saw her she changed she's depressed and she got raped to many times for me to count. We started speaking again and I really started to like her for some reason I don't know if that's because she's more messed up the I am or because we have a lot in common, so we spent the night together and for the first time I didn't feel numb, I actually felt happy. But I left the next morning and couldn't stop thinking about her and tried contacting her again but no answer. Apparently she got drunk and cut her wrists failed attempt to commit suicide, she was sent to an asylum. And there is no word of when she gets out but she agreed to date me, and she is still undecided if she wants to commit suicide, but we agreed if she should want to kill her self then we will do it together and I'm fucking lost here I didn't want to live before I met her but if she gone I'm not gonna try anymore I'm ending it.",behavior

I wish I had friends that would do fun things with me, I wish I had a girlfriend, and most of all I wish I had the willpower to overcome my laziness so I can get out there and follow my dreams. I sit in my room for days on end daydreaming, daydreaming about things that I could be doing in literally five seconds. I daydream about painting, reading, writing; I have paints, canvases, paper and books. Why can't I do anything? I sit in front of the computer screen with my homework up, writing an essay in my head that will never reach the page. For literally a year I've daydreamed about getting my temps; the Bmv is at the corner of my block. I think about running when actually running is a door and a hallway away. I have friends in my mind. There is this girl I saw a while ago in passing and she was absolutely beautiful. I've created a personality for her. In my mind we have a deep, complex, ideal relationship. I don't even know her name so I gave her one. I think I'm making progress in my life, I do more things with each passing day, but the improvement is moving at a snails pace, I can't afford to continue to have my life drowned out by passivity and mediocrity.

This is probably where I should end it, but I want to write about a few more things I'd like to do. I love politics. I'm very politically conscious and I want to be an activist, I have ideas of how I could change the world for the better— but I didn't even attend a George Floyd protest. I don't have the temperament to be a leader, hell, I don't have the temperament to function in life; everything is overwhelming. I've failed three classes in high school. I don't think I'm that stupid, I scored well on the psat and all standardized tests I've taken throughout my life. Now I know that these don't measure intelligence very accurately but I've consistently scored in the 90th percentile or higher and I can't tell if it's the excellent school that I attend or if I'm actually not dumb. I feel so stupid. I feel constantly out classed by my peers, and I am intimidated by them.

431,"Death is a mercy I do not deserve. I've been having suicidal thoughts for years now though had only recently been diagnosed psychologically; didn't wanna burden my parents with the astronomical psychologist/psychiatrist fees in my country. I must also confess that I am a compulsory truant when it comes to appointments with my psychologist and school counselors for pretty much the same reason. They can't charge me if I don't book appointments in the first place). I wanna kill myself. This thought has been a constant companion for years now that at this point it's almost a hobby. In my spare time, I've contemplated and devised almost every possible way to accomplish that in my home quarantine situation. I've calculated how much isopropyl alcohol I would need to ingest in one go in order to guarantee a slow painful death by poisoning. I've tested the strength of every possible attachment point for a noose to see if it can support my fat ass. I've determined whenever the person with the noisy ass sports car is most likely to get out of the house (to work or something idk their life) so that I can potentially jump in front of  their speeding car (ruled this option out cuz I don't wanna traumatize them). I even figured out how to ensure that my family members don't catch me in the middle of offing myself before death embraces me. I guess my quarantine hobby has been ideating lol. I can't remember how it started but nowadays, I want to die because I hate myself. Plain and simple. I can't seem to love myself in any capacity. I want to. I really do. I don't wanna be a hypocrite. I see so much beauty and wonder in others, who by their very nature of being human, are automatically wonderful and fascinating to me. But I cannot spare any of that for myself. Idiot. Disappointment. Coward. Sloth. Burden. Failure. Damaged goods. Hypocrite. Emotionally constipated. Man-child. Degenerate. A bad investment. These are the things I tell myself when I'm at my most vulnerable, which rn seems to be a continuous norm. People say this will past. Hell no. I've done everything. I've talked to friends and family and they've yet to convince me that these thoughts are irrational as much as they've tried. If any, I feel worse because of how much I make them worry when they shouldn't. I'm not worth their time. I've sought professional help but the costs are just way too much for continuous visits. Medications aren't working as much as they used to and stronger ones are expensive here. I've tried many hobbies and pursued what was once my passion. Every method has since fallen through especially this year. Early this year, my mom died and I haven't been able to feel anything other than anxiety and self-hatred. To make her proud was pretty much the only thing motivating me and now she's gone. I also feel guilty for her death (I can't expound to conceal my identity. I don't want anyone who knows me who's lurking around here on reddit to get worried). Before, the aforementioned support methods may have worked. But nothing works anymore nowadays. Right now, I'm really contemplating suicide. I have the plans. I have many options to execute myself. But I don't do it. I don't deserve to. Death is too damn easy for someone like me. Too lenient of a punishment for someone who's hurt others so much. I don't deserve the release of death. I respect the conviction of those who die because they simply choose to do, out of  a desire to cease living. But for me, because of how much I've hurt others, I cannot afford myself that luxury to choose. I must remain and suffer. It is only just. I don't know if this is a good reason to not off myself. But it's been keeping me going for now. I honestly don't know what I hoped to accomplish in this post. I was just scrolling through reddit while ideating as usual and thought to visit this sub. I resonated with what I read. I marveled at the complexity and diversity of suicidal thoughts. I guess I wanted to contribute to the conversation is all. I'm not really expecting advice.

When he said he would leave, I asked him if he wouldn't wanna talk about it and he just said that he is mentally drain (15 years realtionship then break up) but I can't do this right now. Humans only care about you, when they get something from you. God left me alone, he never answered my prayers. I was in therapy on and off since I was 15.

A lot of people's first intuition when trying to help a friend who is struggling and thinking about suicide is to find a solution to the problem, to fix it. Telling a friend to see a specialist, a psychiatrist, and helping him do so is actually helpful, there is no denying any of this, but before over analyzing the situation remember that there are two things that can go a very, very long way, and help a lot more than you may think:. \- hugs. Yes, actual hugs. Ask a guy when's the last time he's been hugged. I bet he can't remember. And girls, who says no to giving a hug to a girl. \- support. Not questions, not advice, but support. The urge to find a solution often makes us forget about the most basic things. thanks for coming to my ted talk",indicator
450,"Cry for help. It's been a month since my partner of 10 years left me out of no where on my birthday. Just had their bags packed and said I'm leaving. I have no closure and still don't even know what happened. She was physically and emotionally abusive to me but never told anyone about it on account of how emasculating it feels. I don't know how you tell people your female partner punches you at home during arguments. She begged me to go to therapy for years and started to with covid, I worked so hard to become a better person and mentally healthy and she hated that version of me. Now I'm a waste of life in their 30's with no reason to live. She took all my friends with her and I just don't have anyone anymore. I drove cross country to be with family to try to sort myself out, but was quickly reminded why I don't spend much time with my family as it's only made my mental health worse. I was happier alone with my dog in my car with no where to go or anything. I've stopped taking my medication and have been drinking heavily, which I hadn't done for a year really. I took my last Ativan today and it's been the only thing keeping me from going off the deep end. I doubt my psychiatrist will prescribe more so it just seems like the end to me. I think for some people suicide is their life's purpose and I feel like I am finally becoming content with that. But I can't even talk like this openly with my therapist or psychiatrist out of fear of just being committed. I know my self and know I will just lie to get out of there too and will only drive me further to killing myself. I just don't understand why people I thought loved me want to hurt me so badly.

COVID-19 is starting to test the limits of my resilience. I fear that I will never see the world because I'm not allowed to leave my country, and the virus just keeps spreading despite the vaccine.

WebMD said it could lead to death. Sounded good enough to me. I remember being yelled at, being slapped, not being able to hear, not being able to stand, and the hospital visit after. At 21, I purchased a gun. It was my first time working with one. I did plenty of research and found where to aim it on my head to ensure I wouldn't be one of the ""lucky few"" to survive a shot to the head. The pain scared me, and even after I chambered my round, I didn't realize the slide wasn't all the way forward. It was off by maybe half an inch, so when I pulled the trigger, nothing happened. The idea of the pain nerved me out so bad that I couldn't go through with pulling the trigger again after I realized my mistake. People were looking for me and knew that I was a danger to myself, and eventually events led me to hospitalization. Just recently, I purchased rope. Strong enough to hold my weight, but I didn't think it'd need to. I read up on partial suspension hanging and thought I had the noose positioning right and everything. I got into a remote location and went with the plan. But, no matter how tight it was or how much I leaned into it, all I felt was the pain and pressure in my head with no sign of passing out coming about. I gave up, my face purple and blotched from the bleeding of every single blood vessel in my face. I knew a full hanging was too much pain for me to take. Today, I have an exit bag set up. I've done it perfectly, and felt absolutely nothing while preparing it just in the same way as I have for a while now in any situation in life. My lifelong depression evolved into depersonalization over the last year, and it's left me feeling so much less of everything. So empty. When I turned that gas valve, though, I panicked. It shot out so much louder next to my ear than I anticipated. I know it won't hurt, or it's not supposed to, but my chest hurt anyways. I turned off the gas and just sat in shock. I don't really know how to feel at this point. I know that this method is surefire if done right (and I've done it right) but realizing the fact that there's nobody in my life anymore who I can even write some god awful angsty suicide note to hurts a little bit. Realizing that this is really it, absolutely for real something that fits within my fears and means feels so odd. I've fought with this for a long time and felt despair over my desire to die until I became numb to everything. Now I have it and I feel somewhere between lonely and anxious. I'm not sure what I'm asking for if anything here, but I'm scared of it failing and scared of dying at the same time. I'm sad that for the last while I've made decisions and actions that unintentionally or intentionally pushed the few people in my life away from me. I feel very alone and exhausted.",attempt

534,"i have this feeling that i’m inevitably going to kill myself i’m zander. i’m fifteen, a sophomore in high school. i always have this feeling that i’m just ultimately going to kill myself. the thing is, i’m terrified of life. it fucking scares me. growing up is fucking scary. and i’m growing up too fast, i feel. i’ve been grappling with depression since the middle of eighth grade, kickstarted by an abusive relationship, and it has only gotten worse throughout the years. my grades in school have me barely getting by ever since, and they’ve only gotten worse with this covid shit. this causes me to feel like a failure. i feel like a loser in comparison to everybody i know. i am stubborn as all hell and unmotivated as shit to do anything in school right now. so when they ask me to treat online school like normal school... when i haven’t seen my fucking friends, my primary motivator in school, for ten months... when my fucking teachers are getting swapped out left and right... when they load me with more work than i’ve ever seen in my life, yeah, i’m gonna get pissed. i’m gonna say fuck you. when something doesn’t feel right, it may as well suck my dick. i hate it but that’s who i am.  i don’t know what career i want to pursue. i never have. no goals. i DO want to love. believe it or not, i have an extremely big heart. i was put on this earth to love somebody else, i believe. but without a job, nothing is possible. without job, no money. without money, no nothing. i hate that. if it were my world, i would be spending everyday with the person i love doing whatever i desire. that’s not the case, obviously. whatever the fuck we want. sounds like heaven, right?  i don’t think i was cut out to live this life. i’m too stubborn. a rebellious nature that i can’t control always has its grips on me. the only reason i haven’t killed myself yet is because i don’t want to harm my family. all of which i love, but certainly don’t like. they’re all kind of toxic people and annoy the fuck out of me. i probably am too. but the idea of inflicting so much pain upon my mom makes me sick. it’s not fair, and as ive said before, i don’t like to do not fair. i never asked to live, and really want to die. why should i feel bad about suicide? i don’t know. i almost resent my mom for bringing me onto this earth. i won’t watch myself become a sad and pathetic adult like my dad or aunt. i just know it’s gonna happen. life is fucking brutal, i know. i’ve seen it. it’s scary. but i’m already becoming my worst fear: a sad and pathetic adult. i feel like i’d be happier dead. if reincarnation is a thing, hopefully i get lucky, or else i’ll probably just kill myself again. if things just go black, shit, even better. i don’t ever have to exist again. i don’t know what’s next. but anything seems better than living on this earth. i wish things were different. i do. but i won’t let life destroy me the way it has everybody else. everybody is so sad. i’ll fucking kill myself before i disappoint my fucking family who has done a GOOD job raising me and taking care of me. wish i could just let life fuck me in the ass like it does to everyone else but i cant. i want to die so bad. god i seriously want to die so fucking bad",ideation

542,"First time I ever consider suicide Sorry for the long post.       I never considered suicide until last year, but I don't think I can go on much longer.        I'm from Lebanon, a small country in the Middle East. You may have heard about it in the news. This country that had an extraordinarily rich culture, perfect geography, and infinite potential, has turned to a literal hell hole in the span of a year and a half. And the worst is yet to come.           In 2019 I was 22, freshly graduated, and had my first job. I had moved out and started living independently, life was fucking great but I didn't realize it back then. I'll spare you the political and economical details unless someone is interested, but in October everything started turning to shit. The effects of decades of widespread corruption and sectarian division started to show, and the economy started going downhill.        I lost my job in January of 2020, along with a huge chunk of the population. I had to start financially relying on my parents again, which already took away what I enjoyed the most in my life: the fact I was finally a self-sufficient, responsible person. Then covid hit. And then on August 4th 2020, what some of you may know Lebanon for, happened.       The third biggest non-nuclear explosion in the history of mankind happened in the heart of Beirut, the capital. It created a shockwave that was felt all the way to Cyprus, a fucking ISLAND 200 kilometers away from Lebanon. Why? Because the government was so corrupt and negligent that thousands of tons of explosive chemicals were dangerously stored in a warehouse and caught fire.      Thankfully my family and I lived far enough from the explosion to suffer nothing but shattered windows, but I was a few hundred meters away from the blast when it happened. You can find footage of the explosion online, so I don't think I have to go in detail as to what happened. I knew my family were home so I didn't worry about them, but my grandpa lived even closer to the blast than I was, and phones were unusable. I started running towards his home, as I anticipated seeing him crushed by rubble.      The thought of describing what I saw that day, running through the city where I made my strongest friendships, found love, studied, graduated, and got into the professional world, already has me shaking and crying.     Entire houses and buildings I knew had turned into rubble. The road was a sea of glass, stone, and cement. Sirens, people shouting, screaming, crying, everywhere. I don't even want to think about how many dead people I ran by. I don't think anyone can even make a movie like this. I think I'm gonna stop talking about this.     Thankfully my grandpa only suffered minor injuries. I'm glad I wasn't the one to take him to the hospital because I don't think I could have taken it. I've heard stories and seen videos of destroyed hospitals, that were already crowded with covid cases, walls and floors covered in blood and doctors performing surgeries on the floor.       This was the last straw for Lebanon. In 2019, 1$ was equivalent to 1500 Lebanese pounds. Today, it's 13800, and increasing by the day. Medicine, fuel, electricity, and food are becoming less and less accessible. People are fighting in supermarkets over bread or milk for their kids. Lebanon is the poorest, hungriest, and most politically unstable it has ever been. Robberies and violence are becoming routine. We're headed to a collapse that will be remembered in history books as a case study of how corrupt, evil, greedy, and hateful humans can get.     And then there's me. I've spent the last few months alone in my appartment because of lockdowns and the financial crisis, with no job, no foreign passport or any other way to get out of this hell hole, and nothing to do except watching netflix or playing video games when the electricity and internet connection allow it. I roll a joint the second I wake up because I don't think I can face this life sober for a single hour.       Millions of people around the world go through poverty, traumas and wars, but what kills me from the inside is remembering the life I had, and could have had. I was a regular kid from a regular family, had friends, went to school, and was about to live a normal life. Now I understand how valuable this is. Many of my friends managed to leave or had already left to study abroad before the crisis. The others I barely see anymore. I can't imagine what my parents are going through, raising me for all these years just for me to have my life taken away from me like that.  I have no one to open up to, which is why I'm writing on a new account.       Now I can't do anything other than being a spectator of my own existence and watch hell break loose from my window, holding on to the memory of the two decades of ""normal life"" I had. I guess I'll just continue to exist until I find the courage to get this over with, or until some other mega bomb goes off next to my home.       I beg you to enjoy every friend, family member, pet, every meal in a restaurant, every roadtrip, every party,  every exam, hour spent at work, every laughter, every argument, every fight, every kiss, and every drink as if they were the last you will ever have, because they might very well be.",ideation

So yesterday morning i woke up and walked to get breakfast and i saw my brother with a wound on his nose. I told him about it as it looked like he didn’t notice. He didnt care but i started worrying that a bat bit his nose while he was sleeping (we never saw a bat in our lives) and i found a sticky gum like thing thats white. Its really big and i stepped on it a couple times it feels like gum. So i convinced myself that it was saliva of a rabid animal who flew in. He didn’t worry at all. I later told him about my fears. He started panicking. I panicked too. I didnt really give a shit wether or not i had rabies because im going to kill myself soon but i REALLY didn’t want him to get rabies. He later moved on and forgot about the fear because Of how rare rabies is in My country and the extremely small posibility that a rabid animal could have flew in without causing damage.

730,"I honestly can’t imagine liking my appearance (long vent) I never liked myself or thought I was pretty even when I was little. Back then I was mostly just indifferent to the way I looked, like I didn’t hate my appearance but I definitely didn’t love it. I do remember hating all my school pictures, and whenever I had to see my most recent one I’d look away because I disliked looking at myself. This was back when I was in about third grade I think.  Looking back, I don’t think I was pretty as a kid despite when people say. My family thinks I was a gorgeous baby and kid, but I really don’t see it. When I was in fifth grade there was a slideshow of all the kids in the grades’ baby, kindgarten and current pictures at elementary school graduation, and I remember wincing when mine can up. I was ashamed that everyone had to see me as an ugly little kid.  As I’m writing this I realize how awful it sounds. Maybe there’s just no such thing as a good picture of me, but either way I’m not made for photos. Even when I was little I wasn’t.  I really don’t know how other people can look at themselves in the mirror and not hate what they see. I’m happy they all don’t have to go through what I do. Saying this makes me feel incredibly awful, because I’m not covered in scars (on my face or other easily visible body parts at least) and don’t have any disfigurements or anything. I just hate my skin, my face, my everything.  Everyday when I wake up and look in the mirror I can’t help but think about how unattractive I am. I constantly think about how no one would ever want me and how I’ll never date anyone for several reasons, one of them being how much I dislike myself and my appearance. I think I’d be unfair to a potential boyfriend to have to date someone who hates themselves as much as I do, and that’s assuming someone would actually like me.  Two boys have liked me in the past, one in ninth grade and one a few weeks ago at a psych hospital. The one from ninth grade told me he liked me but not just because I was pretty, but for other reasons I forgot about. He was overall scary and extremely manipulative, so I took that with a grain of salt. The psych hospital guy was really nice and when I mentioned how unattractive I thought I was, he said that all the boys in the room would disagree. He ended up being manipulative as well and was scary too, and I’m never seeing him again anyways so I disregarded that statement.  I just don’t believe it when people call me pretty. I know that when you like a person they look more attractive to you and when you dislike someone they look uglier to you, so when my friends say how pretty I am I just remember that and think that must be the reason. Or they’re just being nice.  I know I’ll never date anyone for a lot of reasons, like because I’m scared of boys/men, hate myself and how I look, have trauma, and am asexual and afraid of sex in general. I don’t think anyone would want me.  Sorry for being a bummer yet again, I just don’t know where else I could vent about this.

756,"Kinda amazed I'm still around honestly. I'm 27, going to turn 28 in a few months. I've been depressed for as long as I can remember. When I was in elementary school I used to constantly wish I had never been born. I was convinced I'd kill myself by the time I was 16. Obviously, that didn't happen.  I've had ups and downs in my life, I had a period of maybe two years in college where I actually genuinely felt GOOD about my life and where it was headed. Then my depression and anxiety got worse again. Spent a week in a behavioral hospital. Got on meds. They took the edge off but I never got back to that positive space. I wasn't miserable though, so they did their job.  Fast forward to last year, my dad killed himself in February. It came out of nowhere. Not gonna get deep into it, but we never had a great relationship until we reconnected around 2018. It pretty much wrecked me. I'm still not ""over it."" I can't even handle thinking about him.  Literally the only reason I haven't killed myself is because of my mom. She has no other family and it would destroy her if I died, especially in that way. I will not do that to her. But, as it stands right now, I'm going to kill myself when she's gone. I've never admitted that to anyone but I need to get it off my chest.  I keep hoping that something will happen to make me want to stick around. That I'll find passion for something, get a good job, maybe a partner. You know, the usual things. But it's hard to even muster up the energy to do simple things like get out of bed and shower. It's also just. . . hard to plan for the future when you've spent your whole life thinking, ""I'm going to kill myself one day.""  Honestly I'm kinda just posting this to get it off my chest.

781,"(TW) Suicide is sometimes rational, and I'm trying to honestly figure out if that's where I'm at I'm 22, I've been homeless and fleeing domestic violence for most of my adult life with severe chronic PTSD, eating disorders that I'm statistically pretty likely to die from before 30 and depressive-psychotic episodes which often come at the worst times and put me in increased danger or can cause me to (accidentally) hurt anyone who cared enough to stick around. I wake up most days at 4 am re-experiencing rape, and my day usually gets worse from there on out. I've tried EVERY treatment I could access, from years of hospitalizations (10+, mostly voluntary and ALL of them made it much worse) and way more medication than any person should take, to off the books treatments and therapists, psycho-analysis, massage, acupuncture and Chinese herbs, other herbs, self-medicating with fun herbs, seeing dieticians and nutritionists and holistic life couches, DBT, CBT, ACT, EMDR, all kinds of groups and programs, live-in programs, eating disorder residentials, endless outpatient clinics, case management, peer support, even psychedelic therapy, getting an emotional support animal, skydiving, learning to play the harp, traveling the continent multiple times and trying to create my own hospital alternatives.  I've literally done everything I have the power to do to try and recover inside and outside of the system, and most of these things haven't made a considerable difference or have actually made it actively worse (meds lol). No matter the case, I don't have the resources to keep trying and I just don't have the energy anymore either.    My life ending early is likely to be unavoidable anyway, and continuing to live this miserably when I know it's likely for nothing (that I'll never get to recover, feel lasting happiness or maintain healthy relationships), feels cruel to me, especially when I can't stay alive without re-experiencing severe trauma near-daily and putting myself at real risk to repeat that trauma regularly.

She knows I need help, but she refuses to help me. She's literally killing me. I don't know how long I can stay like this. I also have misophonia and they think it's funny to purposely trigger it.

I have not a clue why. But it has financially crippled me. I can't see myself buying presents for Christmas or just surviving. I'm fucked. It doesn't matter how much I beg and plead for help, I get nothing. I see no reason to keep on living. I can't just keep barely surviving anymore.

921,"I don't think life was meant for me Right now I am crying because I am useless. Things haven't changed since I last posted which was when I was 24.. 27 now and my life is still stagnant and I don't see it moving any time sooner. I am still clueless, don't know what's going to happen. Except now I'm now under a lot of pressure because of my mom's health. First of all. I'm 27 never had a job because my anxiety and me feeling clueless about how the world works has held me back. My mom had a heart attack april 2020, she constantly bitches at me about how useless I am, and brought me down so much that I have 0 confidence. I then started talking to a toxic person online and that didn't help either. I just didn't want to be alone. They changed the way my whole brain thinks. I was manipulated and allowed it because I just didn't want to be alone plus it made me feel less crazy and weird talking to someone that was like that. It's hard to explain I guess I stopped loving myself so I just stayed. Well I stopped taking care of myself in like 2014. I havent been to a doctor since 2010. I have a hard time taking care of myself. I don't even know how to make appointments for myself. I hate company when they come over now and can't stand being around people. I have panic attacks. At 27 I should have my life partially figured out but I don't. The only accomplishment I have was from 2013. I watch my siblings all stepping ahead in life. My parents are divorced, we live with my brother. I feel like I don't belong here because my mom says if it weren't for them I'd be homeless and no one would take me in if it wasn't for them. I don't feel good about myself. I don't even feel attractive anymore. My mom always worries me, yells at me, puts me down,  says she's going to die soon within 8 years.  I feel like shit because I don't want that to happen and feel like if she does I'll be at fault, I want to kill myself because of her. She says I add nothing but stress to her life, and pretty much begs me to get out there and as stupid as it sounds I can't and won't. I am not normal, so please don't judge me. I don't need to hear that because I know. I just want to know if anyone else in my situation so I don't feel alone. At the same time. I wasn't always like this. I used to go out. Didn't suffer anxiety as bad and didn't have agoraphobia, or scared of company, but my family put me down a lot and bullied, made me feel unloved  in the past, it still happens today. but they don't see any issue in their behavior. My mom gaslit me a lot whenever I open up about how I feel.  I get intrusive thoughts where I feel like killing myself is best option because I won't suffer anymore and I won't be a burden to others. I don't want to live in regret and I feel like my mom did enough damage to me, when she dies it will be my fault and I know it's going to be in my head that I could have tried harder for her but didn't. I have a lot more problems I haven't listed because I just don't know what to say or how to say it, but as of right now I feel like killing myself, like I feel like a lost puppy in this world.

Rebounds never usually work out from what I’ve read so that’s good. But I’m pissed at him because he knows what using someone as a rebound does to them. For example me and my best friend were both used as rebounds of the same person. I think I still plan to kill myself the 28th so I only have 3 days left. I’ve been collecting pills for weeks now and have 30 so far. I’m definitely going to need more but I have a plan to get more. But I also have my trusty utility knife blade that’s also going to help with the job. Anyway yeah I’m tired of being alive especially because of my ex. It’s funny that his worst fear used to be losing me to suicide and now I’m sure he doesn’t care :),behavior

I’ve said and done horrible things that still stay with this person and each episode i have makes it worse and worse. i ruined my last chance at being involved in their life with my carelessness. i can’t stop thinking about it and throwing up and getting pains in my chest (here i am being the victim again when it shouldn’t even be about me) and i literally feel like i have no choice but to end my life. it’s what i deserve. i don’t know why i tried to convince myself my BPD was magically cured or something. what the fuck is wrong with me? how did i actually think i had it under control? what the fuck is the point of being here when there’s only one person alive who truly, completely cared about me and its my fault that he’s gone forever? how did i convince myself he didn’t care just because he left me? i fucking destroyed him while believing i was the victim the whole time. i feel like i owe it to him to hurt myself and suffer like he’s had to suffer emotionally and mentally because of me. i basically managed to punish him emotionally for loving me when no one else has or will. i can’t live like this and i don’t deserve to live at all. i don’t know what to do but i know that if i kill myself the world will go on. i can’t live with it. i deserve to feel his pain. i don’t deserve to live or be happy with myself. how have i not understood how disgustingly predictable i am? i need to die and i don’t feel like it’s an option not to anymore. but my family deserves better than to have to find my body. i don’t know what i’m gonna do but i need to do it soon before i start feeling sorry for myself again. i am truly worthless and undeserving of the love he gave me. i am a waste of time, money, and mental, physical &amp; emotional energy. i am truly the monster i so vehemently try to convince myself that i’m not. i need help or to not exist anymore. i’m seriously worried that i’ll do something to myself tonight but i also know i deserve it. is living a better self-punishment? i don’t want to be awake. i need to figure it out.  hang in there everyone and please stay strong for yourselves &amp; others so you don’t end up completely hurting them like me.   - s",ideation

1082,"equal parts bitter rant/unsent letter. today is November 3rd. the day that for many reasons, i had planned on for my suicide.   this decision was made 3 months ago to the date. on September 3rd.  i was in an incredible amount of pain &amp; needed a plan.   i decided that I’d find time to go to the beach. then return to my mother’s home where I’d do it.   there was pain. at that time.  over time the pain changed into vague apathy &amp; a general dissociation from this existence.   early September was also the time i went into a deep isolation. stopped talking to everyone. in an attempt to protect myself.   i don’t really have anything to say. if i cared more, i would articulate all the ways i felt aggrieved. &amp; maybe demand some kind of ramifications but. that doesn’t matter.  i’m not looking for sympathy. no one owes me anything.   i think that i want to communicate that there isn’t going to be a “better” me. there’s some hopes that maybe if i go to therapy. something.   sometime in September i wrote, ‘something inside me has died’ &amp; it isn’t coming back.   there’s nothing i am willing to work towards/to fix.   i am just patiently waiting for my next November 3rd.   i won’t set a date. so i feel flexible enough.  but i know it’s coming. i do not plan to live any longer than i already have - only to experience more pain.   i am wildly miserable now &amp; i just cannot imagine things getting worse. &amp; yet i know they will.   i am building up to the day that i will finally have the courage that sneakily eluded me today.",behavior

I'm extremely angry and suicidal and when I tell people that I keep thinking about people criticizing me they just say that I shouldn't let people's criticisms get to me or something like that. Everyone blames you for everything and says it's your fault if you say something like you feel like you're always criticized or they think you're being too emotional. I'm fucking tired of all these idiots. Maybe what actually needs to happen is that someone needs someone to be more understanding and just listen and then people wouldn't be thinking so much about thier negative experiences with people. It's just throwing fuel on the fire. All you're doing is exposing them to the thing that is triggering all thier trauma. Quit putting all the fucking blame on one person. Try to be more understanding and quit trying to correct or fix and criticize people and I bet you'll be so surprised to see that the person actually gets better if you do those things but also don't expect things to be better after just one conversation.

Everyone that knows me has even mentioned how shitty my luck is. It hasn't really bothered me but since I've started having other problems a while back, it just seems to have been amplified. At this point, I just expect everything to go wrong, which typically is what happens regardless of anything I try. Now I just deserve everything to go wrong and people to use me and mistreat me. I actually feel myself wanting people to use me and treat me poorly. I know that probably doesn't make sense but I deserve it. Really I deserve any kind of bad shit that comes my way. I'm a useless person anyway. I'm glad they can get some amusement from me or at least enjoy using me. I know I won't die soon because of how unlucky I am, so I'll have to do it myself eventually.

The windows are rolled down and I can hear the quietness all around. I just sit and escape into that subtle nothing for awhile.

1201,"am i in the wrong (therapy)?   really feel like my therapy isn’t working out. im not sure if im the one in the wrong, and im trying to look at it from all perspectives, so please help me out. i’ve been with this therapist since february 2020, almost a year and a half. im a minor and did not want to go to therapy but after being baker acted for a suicide attempt my parents forced me to start with this new therapist. i immediately told my parents i didn’t like her and i wanted to switch. they didn’t listen. in the past year and a half i have begged so many times and they refuse to let me switch. they say she has worked with hundreds of kids and is the best in the city. after a year and a half, i am so so so much worse, and while i don’t at all blame her for that because that is mostly due to myself and my mental illness, she has offered no help or support at all and has only made me feel worse. i have never felt like we clicked, i feel like she doesn’t understand what i’m trying to say. i talk about myself and how i feel and she tells me i am wrong. ljke she is telling me how she thinks i feel instead of listening to me talk. she constantly gets mad at me for “not trying hard enough” even though i have repeatedly told her that it is hard for me. i struggle with social anxiety so it is hard for me to open up to strangers. she often asks me if there is anything i would like to talk about and then gets mad at me when i say no, even though i have told her i am too anxious to bring my own subjects to talk about. i feel scared about saying the wrong things to her because of how she will react. if she deems that i’m “not trying hard enough” she gets my parents involved and tells them to be very strict with me, even though she knows that we don’t have the best relationship and in the past it has only made things worse. i finish all my homework with maximum effort and she still complains that i’m not trying. if she doesn’t think i’m trying she calls me spoiled and selfish because i’m not “using the resources im given” which i totally understand that im very lucky to have parents that can afford and care enough to put me in therapy, but being called spoiled and selfish for “not trying” even though i am just sends me into a downward spiral of self hatred and makes my depression so much worse. when i tell her about my suicidal thoughts she says im just “glamourizing/ glorifying death” and that i think it’s cool. which is rlly invalidating because she’s basically saying im suicidal for attention and because i think it’s cool. and when i try to calmly explain that i don’t at all think it’s cool, but i feel so trapped that i don’t see any other way out and im in so much unbearable pain that i can’t survive anymore she tells me “no i think you’re just glamorizing it” which upsets me further. she tells me to “choose happiness” which again, i get where she’s coming from because i know that choosing to have a positive mindset is important to beating depression, but i tell her that it’s rlly hard for me because no matter how hard i try to be happy i end up even more miserable, she tells me that it’s my fault for not trying hard enough and that if i wanted to be positive and happy i would. she constantly points out my flaws and not in a therapeutic way. like when she starts session she always says “hey how are you” and i said “i’m good, how are you” to be polite she says “ugh that’s not what you’re supposed to say you have to tell me how your week was, this is why i say you don’t even try. if you keep this up i’m going to have to tell your parents you aren’t trying.” also, the thing that is currently bothering me the most is her trying to discuss a disorder. now firstly, when she brought it up she said i could reject the diagnosis (non-verbal learning disorder). she told my mom and some teachers too to get multiple perspectives. everyone she talked to (parents, teachers, etc) said that it doesn’t sound like me at all and i meet none of the criteria. i talked to her about it and said “hey i really don’t feel like i fit this at all, but i’m open to the diagnosis and would love to hear why you think i have this. if i have NVLD i would love to be diagnosed and get treatment but i don’t want to be misdiagnosed especially because no one who knows me thinks i have the symptoms.” so i tried to listen to her with an open mind but the things she said were complete bullshit. like she went over the symptoms list and just said things that were completely false (like things that just never happened) and refused to listen when i told her “that’s not what happened” for example, last november i was at rock bottom, so suicidal and was failing out of school, so my parents switched me to a small private school with ten kids in my grade. i was so so so angry at them. also, on top of this the kids were actually insane (on my first day there one of them lied about being in sandy hook and another followed me through the parking garage). anyways, i was very angry and sad so instead of hanging out with the other kids during lunch break, i went up to the pharmacy and bought bottles of pills so i could try to kill myself. i spent the majority of my lunch breaks loooking for ways or places to kill myself because at the time my family was being very unsupportive and i wasn’t allowed to see my friends and i was going through so much. anyways, my therapist brought this up. and she said “kids with NVLD often are ‘loners’ or isolate themselves and are socially awkward. you going off on your own during lunch shows this behavior.l” and i said “ i was literally trying to KILL MYSELF how are you going to use that as an example??!” and she was like “i think it’s fair to use that as evidence you have NVLD” and all of her examples were like this!! and i was like “there’s literally no solid evidence and no one else who ACTUALLY KNOWS ME thinks i have this disorder it’s complete bullshit if you have real reasons fine but it’s not fair to use lies to make this claim instead of listening to me.” i just feel like it would be way more helpful and productive if i could explain how my brain works and how i interpret things and she tells me if that aligns with NVLD. but when i try that she says “yeah that doesn’t seem like NVLD but i still think you have it”. like when she asks me a question and i say “i don’t know” because i don’t like being put on the spot she says that that’s “not understanding broad concepts” so i automatically have NVLD. it’s just so frustrating. i told her i’ve done so much research and watched so many videos about people talking about their experiences with NVLD and how it affects them and i relate to NONE OF IT and she doesn’t listen. my mom has done the same thing and also says she doesn’t see how it relates to me because i’m good at reading social cues, know what to say, am good at making friends, grasp concepts well, etc. it makes me really mad that she refuses to listen. she makes me feel so horrible about myself. every session with her makes me hate her and hate myself. i’ve begged my parents to quit and they won’t let me. idk what to do. ",attempt

It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 26 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful. To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going.

She’s flirted with me a lot, even if she claims she hasn’t.She knows I like her. I’ve told her a few times. But she made it clear she wants to be just friends. At first I was okay with it, got a girlfriend, then I broke up with her because I was thinking of my friend, while I was with my now ex girlfriend. But I can’t take it anymore. She tells me about the people she’s had sex with, and every time she does it kills me a little more inside. She tells me about all the guys she likes. I want to be supporting and help her out. But I can’t do it. It makes me feel weak. I’ve talked to her about this before. She was understanding, but it made things weird for a while. But we got past it, and are back to normal now. But I just can’t be around her, even though all I want to be with her all the time. I just do whatever she wants, I’m there for her all the time. I let her control me honestly, but then I go and say it’s not her fault. Not her fault I caught feelings, not her fault it looked like she led me on, I mean hell she spent the night in my house. In my bed. But we’re just fiends, and that’s what friends do I guess? It’s not her fault I get upset over her having sex with other guys. She’s not my girl, and never will be. I don’t want to loose her as a friend, but keeping her is killing me too. But the thought of letting her go kills me more. She’s literally perfect in every way. I thought I was over her, I was catching feelings for someone else. All was good. Then she needed a place to sleep one night, and here I am again. In love with a girl, that doesn’t want me. While the girl who does want me has no idea. I’m scared to even try relationships because I don’t want to led them on. The whole reason my ex and I didn’t work. I don’t know what to do anymore.

I'm feeling a little nervous about posting here as I don't want anyone in my real life to find out but I thought this would be a good resource for me. If this post shouldn't go here let me know and I'll take it down.   I'm a first time mom to a 9 month old boy. I've had issues with depression and anxiety since middle school but I've always been able to manage it ok. A few years ago I started taking birth control pills to regulate my hormones which really helped my mental health a lot, so when I got married I just stayed on the pill for preventing pregnancy as well. It clearly didn't work for me, as I now have a 9 month old baby. Since giving birth I've struggled with PPD and PPA, and I needed to start taking some form of birth control again to prevent another pregnancy, but the pill messes with breastfeeding and failed last time so I couldn't do that and got the arm implant instead. I don't know if my current issues have to do with the new implant or just PPD/PPA or just because I haven't been able to take the pill anymore or what, but it's getting bad.   My mental health has declined so much in the last 9 months I feel like I'm not even the same person. It's getting constantly worse and worse every day to the point where I have saved and hidden the bottle of oxycontin they gave me after giving birth (they gave it to me due to complications I won't go into rn), in case I want to take them all at once and end it. I've taken them out of the bottle and just held them in my hand a few times, but I was too weak to go through with it. I know I have enough of them to kill me. I know my husband and son would be better off without me. My son is so young, he wouldn't remember me so he wouldn't truly feel the loss later in life. My husband is young (we're early 20s) and a wonderful man so he could easily find someone else, someone better. I'm toxic and treat him badly. I know he walks on eggshells, the smallest thing can set me off and I have these extreme mood swings, I feel like a crazy person but I can't stop. I completely break down all the time for literally any reason or sometimes no reason. I hate myself. I'm angry and frustrated constantly but I can't show it to my son, I have to make myself smile and play with him and meet his emotional needs, so then I have no energy left for my husband. I'm completely emotionally drained. At the end of every day at I just lay in bed exhausted but unable to sleep, wishing I was dead. I don't want to feel like this anymore, I don't want to feel anything. When I think about death it feels like peace, it gives me comfort. I just want to lay down and sleep and never wake up.   My husband has tried so hard to support me, he took over most of the household chores and is an equal parent when we're both home. I told him I was really struggling and even having some suicidal thoughts but I downplayed it. He begs me to see a therapist but he's scared to push me on it. He tells me all the time he appreciates me, and that he and my son need me. It just makes me feel worse. I've treated my husband so badly and he still is so gentle and caring. He deserves so much better and he'll never leave me and I can't leave him, I cant do this without him, so I should just make the choice for him and he'll be forced to move on and find someone better. He wants me to see a therapist so bad, he's scared and I hate seeing him like this i wish I just hadn't told him. I just can't do this I can't call anyone I can't ask for help I don't want to sit in a room and have someone tell me how shitty I am, I know how shitty I am and I don't need a therapist to tell me about it. what are they going to tell me that I don't already know? How do you even go about finding a therapist? I asked my doctor a couple years ago and she said I have to look into all the therapists in my area and find one that takes my insurance. That feels like an insurmountable hill. Not to mention that even if I find one I might not click with them and I've heard you have to meet several therapists before you find the right one for you I just would rather end it and have this all be over. I don't know what to say to my husband. I have to take my son in for his 9 month checkup in 6 days and they're going to make me fill out that fucking mental health form and I don't know what to do. I dont want to lie, I HATE lying with every fiber of my being, but if I fill it out accurately it'll set off the red flags and they'll have to ask me a bunch of questions and what if they decide I'm not fit to parent because I might kill myselfand  what if they take my son away? What if they call CPS and they try to take him away from me? I would rather die than lose my son.

I fight these battles every day inside my mind. I have nobody. People say they want to talk but all they want to do is tell me to see someone so they can move on. My family are beautiful people, yet my parents get angry at me if I talk about how I feel. And my brother has his own family and has no time for me. My fiance left me last year. He couldn't handle it. And when I stop trying to ask friends to see me, all of a sudden I started to spent every night alone.   I'm scared. I started to make goodbye videos last week. How can I do this to my son? How can my eight year old son spend his life wondering why he wasn't enough for his mother to live for?  I'm scared. I know how I'll do it. It's a matter of when.

But I let my student depression and low self-esteem tell me she didn't love me anymore, so I started seeking attention in the form of chatting to another women. It naturally got found out and, on top of our problems that was the last straw.  So I had to move in with my parents, my narcissistic, abusive mother. This was 2 weeks ago.  I still talk to my wife for arranging time with the kids and some general talk. There's no problems with seeing the kids, she even invited me over yesterday and today for a bit for the kids. I know I shouldn't get any hopes up that she's softening her hard-line of splitting up, but I did because we've talking more.   I worked most of today, I'm a community carer and we had a bit of cheeky banter, I though that maybe she was going invite me over for a bit. But instead we had a cigarette at the door and that was it.   I fucked everything up, I've got no hopes of repairing things with her no matter how hard I want to.

1365,"I really just want to die I’ve felt this way since I was 14, I’m 18 now. I had toxic friends who told me I couldn’t be depressed because my life is too good and it wasn’t possible, they berated me when I started isolating myself, telling me they were scared of me and that I was being a bitch. These people had been my friends for 3 years, I didn’t have anyone else because I was introverted and shy so I thought I had to stay with them or I’d have no one. My dad has always been emotionally manipulative and mentally abusive, I was terrified of being left on my own with him until age 12, he made me feel like I wasn’t worth anything unless I was good at school, which I wasn’t. I barely passed my GCSEs, I dropped out of A levels when we (the uk) went into the first lockdown because my head of sixth form told me I was just going to fail anyways. I’ve had a string of toxic relationships, been sexually abused a few times. I made really good friendships in the last year but in a matter of weeks I lost all of them and now they all hate me (it was my fault, I made a mistake and I fucked up, I deserved it). I feel so alone and so fucking numb, most days I can’t get out of bed. I used to get so passionate about things, I used to love so so strongly, but now the only thing I really feel is despair. It’s like death has a rope tied around me and it’s slowly dragging me away from everything. I wouldn’t even care if it just pulled a bit fucking quicker. I’m not scared of death at all, I haven’t been for years; I tried to kill myself back in May, I really thought I was going to die and I wasn’t scared at all, I was relieved that I would finally be able to rest properly. Since then it’s just gotten worse and all I can think about is how beautiful it would be just to suddenly cease to exist, to finally be at peace. The only reason I haven’t is because I feel so selfish leaving my mum on her own, she loves me so much and I love her, I just wish she could understand how much pain I’m in all the time and how difficult it is just to be alive. Actually fuck that, I’m not alive, I haven’t been alive for months, I’m just existing in a world that didn’t anticipate me surviving this long. Living isn’t lying in bed crying your eyes out every night. Living isn’t smiling to everyone and doing such a good job of convincing them you’re okay after years of practice. Living isn’t getting up and going about my day in a trance, feeling so numb it’s as if I’m watching someone else live my life for me while I crouch in the corner of my mind, shivering and sobbing. The worst part is that I don’t want to live. I don’t want to be happy because it makes it so much worse when you go back down again, I don’t want to be happy because that means having people around and all I’ll do is hurt them. I just wish there was a way to stop existing and make everyone forget I ever existed in the first place. I don’t want people to mourn for me because I want to die to stop hurting them. I wish people could see how much pain I’m in and how exhausted I am so that maybe they could understand even slightly why I felt I had to do it. I wish people could just be happy that I’d be at peace for the first time in so long. I just really really want to die.",attempt

Is my suicide justified then? Why does the majority of people think that most suicides are not justified. They can justify a person kill themselves if they are suffering with immense physical pain that isn’t going to go away considering how many options they have tried to reduce the suffering but to no avail. But when a person kills themselves if they are suffering with immense emotional pain that isn’t going to go away considering how many options they have tried to reduce the suffering but to no avail, then people say the suicide isn’t justified.

Sometimes I will try and change it for the better but I simply do not have the motivation and drive to make it consistent.

For the past few months I have been heavily debating on whether or not I kill myself. I look at the pros and cons and the pros seem to outweigh the cons.

I don't believe in wallowing in self pity or oversharing on the internet, but sheesh guys this is hard. People go on and on about how you shouldn't feel guilty about not being there, but the truth is that I can't feel anything else. I really do wish that I was in the same room to tell him ""NO!"". I wish I was there to hug him a last time. I wonder a lot if he thought about me ... was I not enough to make him stay?  I've never quite cried this much in my life and my entire world is collapsing into this burning hell on Earth. Everyday when I get up I can't send a stupid snap, share an unfunny history meme, or wonder about the future loudly. Who am I going to go to swim meets with? Who am I going to talk to to? All of a sudden, life is getting very real. Throughout this senior year, I've maintained a really good GPA and kept up with absolutely everything even through quarantine but honestly, I can't do this anymore. It's hurting me to think that life is going to move on.  I attended his funeral a week ago and listening to the pastor was disgusting. He was saying things like ""he chose to leave"". I do not believe that my best friend made the active choice to leave - he felt helpless and lonely - those are not the same thing. I will never believe that one thoughtfully considers the choice of killing themself.  I feel thrown off my path. It sucks to say this, but I'm going to have to prioritize my exams this spring over my mental health or anything else. And also, to hell with society about the stigma around mental health. You live in hell and make others walk through hell as well when you say us guys can't speak about our emotions. To hell with this rotten education system that requires 17 and 18 year olds to make choices about their 40 year-old selves.  I'm going to try to end by saying that it's going to kill me just the same when I have to graduate without him, listen to our favourite songs without him or get married and not have him be my best man. I'm getting ripped apart piece-by-piece everyday but I'm going to have to move forward with this pain. I need to hope that it hurts less in the future. I just need to get though my IB exams. I just need to make it to May.  I hope that if you've ever ""*considered*"" commiting suicide, you're being played by your own brain.

1407,"I hate everything about myself. So I’m 22, I have a year and a half left of school. I changed programs so all my friends have already graduated. From the outside it looks like I have it all. I’m a varsity athlete, executive director of three prominent student groups, an honours student, and I’m one of the supervisors at my job. People look up to me. I’m a trans rights activist. I’m a disability advocate. I’m a hard worker and I look like I persevere through things.   However, I don’t.   I’ve posted before, my family is shit basically. That situation is still horrible. However in the span of 72 hours I’ve needed to get glued back together in emerge twice, and I haven’t slept because I’m laying awake dissociating trying to not kill myself. Nothing feels real. I spend hours laying in one spot thinking about dying.   My friends left me when I became their boss at work, my partner just dumped me because I have too much going on, I’m broke and my solution to not having money is to be a sugar baby but I feel filthy because I’ve been sexually assaulted and never dealt with the trauma, my ex from several years ago is saying I stabbed him (that never happened, he’s currently having a psychotic break. he sexually assaulted me and I dumped him. That was it), I was in ANOTHER car accident, and I failed a practical (frisbee, it’s a blow off course) because I was mourning the death of my friend who got hit by a car cycling in September. My bio mom told me she doesn’t want anything to do with my, my dad and step mom don’t want me if I’m trans (‘you’re a monster destroying our daughter’).   My life has always been hard. I’ve been verbally, physically, and psychologically abused for much of it. I’ve been sexually assaulted four times. I’m chronically ill with epilepsy, gastroparesis, and a rare blood disorder that has no cure and just destroys my body. My parents denied me access to doctors when I was a kid so my system is completely fucked up. I need surgery to repair some things and I just found that out. I keep pushing through but I’m so. So. Fucking. Tired. I can’t push through it anymore. My counsellor wanted to take me to the hospital yesterday but I managed to talk through things because I knew if I went to the hospital I couldn’t kill myself.   I took too many pills and I’m still alive. I got a little carried away with self harm and then didn’t treat it for a good hour hoping things would just end. I can’t do this anymore. I hate everything about myself. Nothing is good enough. I’m not good enough. I made a video saying goodbye. This isn’t my ex partner’s fault, even though it lines up with me being dumped (time wise). Did it affect things? yes. But it was more of a ‘final straw’ situation. I can’t bring myself to delete the video. I cant bring myself to think of the next 20 minutes let alone the next 24 hours.  My body and mind are a mess. My life is a rollercoaster I can’t get off of. I have nothing and no one. I already have someone who will take my pets when I die. I wish I could make things work. I’ve tried so hard. But nothing helps. Everything always falls apart. Everything I touch breaks. I wreck everything. It feels like everything is out of my control; so I’m going to take back that control. I can control my life: whether I live or die. I know that if I die, everything will be better for everyone. Why push forward when there are so many reasons to give up. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.   These thoughts are all disjointed, none of my sentences flow properly; probably because I can’t focus and also because I’m just letting out what pops into my mind. My fingers are flying across the keyboard desperately trying to convey my thoughts in a last ditch attempt to talk things through with myself. No one can save me but myself, and I know that.",attempt

I knew that covid would negatively affect people with depression, anxiety and suicidal ideations. I’ve lost loved ones to suicide before, and last April was no exception.   I’ve gone to funeral after funeral after funeral. Life doesn’t promise us anything except that one day it will be over, so until then why not stick it out?  I want to share a couple things that I hope will help some of you out there. My wish is that whoever is reading this will shed light.   • We tend to want to disappear in order to be found. We also can want to disappear from existence because we are tired and the burden gets beyond heavy. You’re more resilient than you think. There’s always someone out there you may not have met yet who has an open heart and hand to be there for you. Your life and existence is an unique as a fingerprint. It’s one thing to relate but be careful when you compare. Life isn’t a Competition as much as a lot of people make it out to be. Sometimes a lot of want to see if “anyone cares” to find us....I’m telling you people do. Start with me because I do care about you...and I mean it.  • Why was I born? To make a difference for yourself and you have the power even in the smallest of ways to make a difference. I’ve asked myself why the hell I had to be born. “Why didn’t my mom abort me?” Crap like that. “I didn’t ask to be born.” Well, I’m here. I was given life for ME, and at the end of the day you were given life to allow yourself to enjoy. You can be there for people you care about, but you have to take time to look into what it really means to love yourself. Youtube has a lot of videos on self love. I know it seems like a dumb corny idea, but it’s worth giving yourself a fighting chance. You were born to go on a quest to experience more than just the lame and depressing situations we can feel stuck in. Reach out.   • The simple things in life can be more rewarding than you think. Mindfulness helps a ton. It may seem trivial, but as human beings the mind tends to be geared toward: instant gratification, quick fix, NEXT  Take time to actually taste the food and drink. Take time to focus on your body when you take deep breaths to relax. Meditation is underrated.  • Loneliness and longing for connection is normal. Amid this uncertain time, there are several platforms on cool new apps to meet new people. It may seem lame but you never know who you’re going to meet and connect with. You might actually enjoy yourself.   • We tend to have habits of thinking and cycles we revisit. The hardest part of breaking any habit is the beginning. Then it becomes easier and more rewarding, because the fruits of labor are.   • Allow yourself to be treated as if you were treating someone you love the most. We tend to negative self talk quite often and I’m telling you to cut that out immediately. We all have to keep ourselves in check but put down the bat. If you like to do art or sing because you like it even though you may feel like you’re not “good enough”, do it! Anyone can make art, and it’s so much healthier for the brain than people think. Don’t limit yourself. Don’t sell yourself short.   • Bad memories are part of life unfortunately, but there’s got to be at least one okay memory you have right? If you’re saying “no” you’re lying to yourself. It’s okay, right now you feel like crap and it feels like everything absolutely 100% sucks....but give it a little time....you’ll think of a good memory.....and perhaps (probably) there will be a good time in your future that you wouldn’t have imagined.

1563,"This is not Temporary... the pain never ends My name is Adam and i have been suicidal for as long as i can remember. It all started in school as a kid i was an awkward child in a small town, where you grow a reputation quickly, i was quickly known as the kid to stay away from if you want to be popular. I made my peace with it i thought maybe in high school i would have another chance, I quickly found out that wasnt the case, i got bullied like crazy in high school to the point that i really started considering it for the first time. I found out how to tie a noose and i found some rope in my dads workshop and tied one and kept it in my room and for long periods of time i would just look at it considering. I ended up not doing it thinking to myself, It must get better once school is over, that is what everyone keeps telling me they cant be lying right one day its going to get better. Then school ended with me never really having a friend in my life outside of my dog, never once having a sleep over or going to another kids house but i made it threw high school. Ontop of all that BS with just being a lonely piece of shit i have always been a failure when it comes to any kind of academics or skills that would lead to some kind of career, I am 25 years old and have never made over 10k a year, no kind of post secondary and no prospects to speak of what so ever. Still living with my mother and she wants me out more and more with each passing month, nothing saved to speak of, at this point i have moved on from the noose and i think about a cliff near my house and have decided when i do it it will be there as i imagine it being the least painful. To add some more shit ontop i am asexual or at least i think i am, as far as i can tell i have never been attracted to a man or women in my life time, never been on a date of course since i have never had a friend and everyday i just want to jump more, there is no enjoyment, no fun just dread of being a poor failure that will be homeless once my mom has had enough and has no chance as success in the future, the most successful future i can hope for is a trash apartment that i can pray i can afford on my cashier salary. I also just found out that I don't have a job anymore I was layed off for the winter and supposed to start again soon now I just found out they don't want me back so seems like just another reason to do it, when nothing good ever happens for you and it is just shit on shit on shit why keep going. I just want it over and i am going to make it happen soon, i have had enough and want it done. idk why but i started cutting myself recently... just on the arm idk why but i like the pain Jesus reading that i sound so fucked up...",behavior

On top of this I don't believe anything he says to me. Even yesterday he told me he loves me randomly and I couldn't help but think it's fake. Same with his plans of what we should do when we marry.

I email her and she still says its a riddle I have to solve...?

On the compt she never is specific and writer just the dimensions of the work. I know this may seem like so stupid but I'm taking 6 classes and they're all hard too. I'm in the program that helps students because of their disability. I have OCD and other shit but they still treat me like I'm wired the same. As if this pandemic isn't making me already stressed. Also, last December is when my brother took his own life. I found him with my mother. He was literally my light. He struggled with some very hard mental illnesses and was gone from this realm long ago. These days as its getting colder I'm getting sadder. What is the point of me being in school. i feel like a failure. I wish I was richer because I swear the only thing I like are films and making drinks/pastries.  I'd open up a cafe if I could like that's the only thing that kept me going in highschool because that was my future plan. Now that I've grown up, I know what my life is. That's not going to happen unless I come into some stable money and move from this city with a million other cafes. Life is so hard and I don't see any hope.

1593,"I know everyone have different reasons big or small as to why they want to off theirselves. Do I have a reason for me to leave this body? Dont I deserve to not be here? Why am I so scared to force it? *Very graphic* My name is Parish Mack. Im telling yall my name because I feel my deaaaathh being near. Mom and dad was never together so you can say i was a basstard child, a one night stand baby. Mom keeps other baby and my grandma raises me. Dad doing his own thing and drug dealing didnt raise me of course. Whenever he did come around he acted like a jealous assshole because he felt my grandma loved me more. Probably why he stole everyone she brought for me and some stuff of hers. When people want to change when they feel like it, everything is ""the past is the past"" but ohh when you do something its different. We will get to that. I lived a sheltered life and my grandmother did all she can to provide me a normal life. I was far from normal. I was molested when i was young kid from this guy next door. Back then i thought it was a game sitting on lap showing each other our penisesss. I was probably 5 or 7. I was also introduced to it from my 9 year old female cousin when i was around that age too. I get soo hornnny especially when i was able to ejaculate at 18. I was and still am a quiet, smelly, piece of nothing. Everyday i got bullied and i never stood up for myself. I keep so much bottled up. My grandma definitely made me feel loved. Closet thing to unconditional love i had. I never believed mom n dad loved me no matter what. Grandma adopted me and became my guardian.  Everything was going well (at least from a sheltered not knowing whats really going on point of view) until she started getting sick. She dieeddd on the day after my 18th birthday. I literally felt like i lost a part of me. Mom and dad all of sudden started coming around more. Looking back at it now I feel as though they did it to save face and to this day I regret ever getting closer to them. Backfired on me. Never talked about these things and they acted as if nothing happened. I started smoking, i started messing up badly. I started doing sick things. Incestt, it went from her wanting it more to me wanting it more and she didnt want to do it anymore. Went from staying with my aunt after my gma dieedd, to him, to my aunt, to mom, and then got an apartment at 19. I lose my apartment and everything in it and from there I started making them look good. They became the good guys and i eventually became the evil person. I shouldnt of messed up the way I did, but i really regret was NOT killllling myself around 2011. Fast forward, im 28, everything is all my fault, dad is a freemason living his best life, mom and everyone else in that family living their best life. Here i am, outside, not wanting to live being cursedd to go out in the most painful and humiliating way. As i said i messed up my life but what i messed up the most was not bringing up all the messed up stuff they did. I didnt bring it up. Therefore they felt that they were off the hook. Then i started f'n up badly which definitely let them off the hook. Everything is on me now and i got to accept that. I took on their faults along with the messed up stuff ive done. From 2011 until now.  I wish deaaathhh upon them everyday for bringing me into this world. Especially him. I dream of killlingggg him at least once a week. I know there is no Jesuss or Satann. I ""woke up"" but i ""woke up"" too late. And at this point idc and it dont matter what I know i don't want to be in this body anymore. I know im wrong regardless of who says otherwise and i just don't care. I told myself if i ever see them or any other family member and they try to come after me, either they end me or I end them.

1605,"Found out ex attempted suicide by overdose after she called me. She's in ICU after I called emergency services even though she was against it. I don't want her to be upset with me. What can I do for when she recovers and to prevent her from doing it again? I'm so sorry this is long and detailed.   She was my work colleague for 2 months before she moved on and I got to know her properly. We were together for almost 3 years and left on really good terms. We left because we knew it was too much work for both of us - I'm Christian and part-Palestinian, she's Jewish and part-Israeli. We were so deep in the relationship but also hesitant. Hesitant because of our family's reaction to our sexuality, religious and ethnic backgrounds. But I went into it because I knew there was a chance for a long term relationship - both of us worked in London and far away from our families who live outside the city.  She's Cambridge educated and one of the brightest and quickest minds in one of the most difficult and prestigious careers you could get into. So, my mind told me I didn't need to check on her all those months - she was definitely doing well after moving on from me and finding someone else.   She placed a missed call yesterday morning and I called back later that night to check why. I was anxious to pick up because her call meant something serious. She told me she called to hear my voice and apologise for telling me we couldn't work out.   I knew something was up so tried to stay as calm as possible. I told her it was lovely to hear from her, asked her where she was, if anyone was with her etc. and she told me she was alone in her flat, she apologised for calling earlier and that she was just dealing with a small overdose. I knew I had to get her medical attention . We finished the call without me telling her I was driving to her flat.  I got to her flat and told her I just wanted to see her, to speak to her. She let me in and we were so quiet. Nobody spoke for about 15 minutes, until I noticed she was getting off the sofa and I just went up to her and held her really tight. I didn't want her to leave, I didn't want her to go out of my sight for a second. I knew I had to be extra careful with my words to get her to come with me to the hospital. We sat talking about everything for a good 4 or so hours and I could tell she was in visible pain. I tried to be as subtle as possible, told her let's go together and check on you, just a quick check to see what's going on but it'll ultimately be your choice whether you want that treatment or not. She told me she wouldn't go, that she just wanted to wait at home for everything to end. We were silent for a while after she said that. I felt like I fucked up with my words because she didn't budge. I left her flat and just sat in the car, I couldn't just sit at home and let it happen. I walked back to her flat a few hours later, called emergency services and begged for her to come, just for a check up and somehow convinced her when they arrived.  I don't know what to do, I could only call those who knew about our relationship (all but one are outside the city), so I have almost no physical support. I've not slept in so long and called in sick for work today. What do I do if she gets upset with me? What can I do to help prevent this being repeated in the future?

If i jump over a bridge or something people might say that i did it for attention or whatever bullshit they say when someone commits suicide.  Anyways....I thought about not drinking water for multiple days to make me.dehydrated so that i can die.

However, it seems like we are heading in that direction. I have really poorly managed anxiety, we've been playing with my meds for months now. Almost a year ago I had a pretty serious suicide attempt, and it's been a waiting game since then to try and get me back on track due to the lack of access to the appropriate medical services.  Anyways, I feel guilty for becoming suicidal during the pandemic. There's so much else happening everywhere (there's no cases in my town), that I feel bad for even considering killing myself but that guilt is what's driving me to the edge. I feel like it's only a matter of  time before I snap. I live alone and I'm terrified that if they quarantine us I won't be able to see my caseworker or my therapist. I've been seeing someone twice a week most weeks because I can't make it more than a few days without going into extreme distress. It doesn't help that I'm coming out of a manic episode. I'm  terrified of being locked in my apartment alone, and I'm scared that i don't know what's happening. I don't even care about the virus. If I get it, I'm a high risk, so it might be bad. But we don't have any cases here. I'm more worried about the actions of other people. I have severe gastroparesis and I'm just so done with living a this point because I'm in such a horrible flare. I can't eat anything. The things I can eat everyone is emptying the shelves of (panic buying soup and rice...etc).   I  don't know what to do.  Ifeel like I can't go to the hospital to reach out for help and support when I'm in crisis, but I also can't keep doing this.

I m freaking out badly. i can't breath im shaking, im crying nonstop. im a hysterical mess. i have cptsd, and being around men triggers it badly, if they are going to arrest me, i will be a serious mental case and break down. i don't know what to do. im already starting to freak out so badly.  if they do say they are going to arrest me or have me arrested or evicted, etc I will end my life. I literally can't be through with that.

1863,"IDK what to do at this point or where to start Any advice is welcome I really need it now more than ever.    Long Story  So I'm writing this as a last-ditch effort, for a version of myself that wants a better life than I currently have. I’ll try to be as brief as I can, I grew up in a single-parent household with an overly protective religious parent. I am the oldest of three siblings on my mothers' side, I have too many siblings to count on my religious dads’ side.  I grew up taking care of my siblings BECAUSE WE ALL HAVE DIFFERENT FATHERS AND OUR FATHERS ARE EITHER DEAD OR TRASH, OR BOTH, and again single black mother with no college education and an indifferent extended family. My immediate family and I were in and out of homelessness throughout my middle &amp; high school years due to both my younger brothers and my mother's frequent sick spells.  At some point during all this, I decided that I was going to commit suicide because I couldn’t imagine a life beyond being there to helping her and my siblings and I felt pretty empty inside.  Growing up in high school I became aware that I was gay or at least BI and was living in the household that I was living in, this is also around the time I learned that my estranged father died. I became detached and isolated myself in high school and away from my family at home. After a time I became involved with my local community center and did a lot of volunteering to keep busy.  Through volunteering, I was shown that there could be a future beyond my current circumstances. I became the face of multiple programs for teens at the community center.  I graduated high school and managed to get into the college I wanted to attend in a different city. A few program directors as well as the founder of my community center gave me both supplies and some resources to make my first year at university easier.  I was able to meet up with a Community Center alum who was attending the same university I was going to and they were going to show me the ropes. I somehow involved my mother in the process and she suggested that I go to a different campus than the one I had set up so that another member of my estranged family could check in on me.  From that point forward it was a slow march downhill, I realized that I was surrounded by people who knew what they wanted and I had no clue. I was still pretending to be straight and pretending to have my shit together and didn't. In truth, I felt empty, alone, and guilty that I had left my family. I was also reminded that I was poor and university life cost money that I didn't have. I got a credit card and went into debt buying college books. I had an emotional and mental break, I failed out of university. I had a falling out with the nearby family member when I failed out of school because I was without an immediate way home and wanted to try and work and get back into school.  From that point onward I was back to feeling suicidal, I tried to regain lost ground but I was ashamed that I had failed, and let my mentors down. I eventual was able to return home and back to more isolation. My depression grew to the point that some days I was bedridden. That was in 2011 and here I am in 2020 feeling just as lost and isolated, things that I once enjoyed I don't now. I came out to my mom, she initially didn't take it well and to this day doesn't take it well. I feel like I have been lying to myself and others for so long that I no longer know what I want from life or why it's worth living. I feel empty, I want to feel like living again. I don’t know what to do with my life, I don't know what to do with my career, I’m in debt to the state and several universities due to me failing classes, I can't afford out of pocket tuition, and have been bouncing from job to job listlessly trying to get into a better financial position while dealing with some of the legit worst people on Earth. I’m the most overweight I’ve ever been. I’m just at a loss and I need to figure out where I go from here. I'm tired of feeling this way.  TL;DR  I’m suicidal, I don't know what to do with my life or career, I’ve been depressed for so long that I’ve lost interest in most things that used to bring me joy. I'm in debt to several educational institutions and am currently unable to continue a formal education because I can't afford it. I am currently very overweight and have always had body dysmorphia issues. I'm currently out of a job Idk what I’m going to do or if it’s even worth it to try. This is a final cry for help, idk what I’m expecting from here but at the very least this will have been a brief account of my life.",ideation

Kissless virgin too.  From 2012 Until 2016 I worked in a bar it was great up until a point  and had good mates great experience and  the most attractive girl in work really  liked me in summer 2014 and I didn’t do anything about it tho.I had a young baby faced pleasant look and felt at my best.   I did get called ugly still  it was sometimes by customers and other staff  tho, but a lot more good things than bad. Met some great people    ◾️***Back then in 2014 I looked better imo. Baby face slim face and appearance totally clear skin. I felt so normal and could go anywhere without feeling self conscious one bit*** my head size has gone bigger mainly with age now I have a big head on a slender body  and the receding hairline   I see tons of people who havnt changed a bit I look the same but a lot worse and puffier faced and my baby face has gone 😞   💡***now I look really  even worse bad. Lost my baby face (which killed me mentally) my hairline has receded more (thick hair tho) my face looks puffy with a red oily nose and slightly swollen nose tip. Havnt looked at myself fully faced for 2 years***    ◾️ an old guy once went to me ‘I wish I was your age again lad, the girls I’d pull’ and i replied with ‘we can swap if you want, I’m ugly so it’s shit’    I  can’t even play ps4 of a night like I used to because I’m too down about it. The light on the screen to my face makes me feel it more.  I havnt left the house hardly since 2016 tbh when I worked at a football stadium once a week and it was good . I felt totally fine up until then. Just every night 9pm to the shop over the road and even then I wear a hood up and a snood like a ninja even when it’s warm. And have to avoid the shop and go to another one 1km further if there’s a gang of girls/guys outside.  I was ok still up until I hit 29 then this.   ⬜️ You wouldn’t believe how different the world is to me now than between 2012-2015 back then girls liked me now I get treated like shit by them. Most of them where I live are horrible tbh   Using apps like tinder and bumble only getting a very few matches then being unmatched within minutes every time hurts too. Sorry I wasn’t the CK model you swiped right on ladies  I smoke weed some days and drink 20cl of scotch with Pepsi every night too I have too admit. (1 litre is 100cl)Iv nothing to look forward to otherwise that keeps me hell of a lot less unhappy   I like to stay up until 4am with the whiskey watching South Park or breaking bad/prison break until I’m drunk enough  to drop right asleep   ***bit i do I drink a fresh 75cl cold bottle of water every morning in fresh air  first thing. Does it help? Does it fuck***  ⬜️***pics in are on my only other post of me back then and now***⬜️   ***when I avoid mirrors and reflections of myself after a few days my mental health is total bliss and it’s a honeymoon phase mentally and I can play games etc and in a good mood and at least -enjoy my nights.

I recently put up a bunch of sticky notes on my desk with different methods and locations I could do it in then tore it down bc one of my friends asked me about it (I just told them it was for a novel I was writing or smth).

1965,"Why I Believe my Life is Simply Not Worth Living (1st post, please read) I'm a 16 year old girl &amp; I've recently realized that life isn't as good as I was once thought it was. For my entire childhood I've felt chronic melancholy or this horrible feeling that something was horribly wrong, even though there wasn't. As far as I know, I had a very healthy and loving upbringing, but for some reason I've always felt like I was put here on this planet to be hated, it's almost like a fact to me. Even when I was 4 years old I strongly believed this, &amp; I still do, &amp; I have no idea why. I have had chronic depression since 7th grade, very bad social anxiety, germaphobic OCD, lots of anxiety about tons of different things, horrible attention span/focusing issues, &amp; now I have POCD, which has made me the saddest out of all of these. I hate school SO much. Even writing one sentence for an English project saps all my energy. I have about 5 hours of homework every day but I usually only do a bit or sometimes none. What's bothering me now is that I have thought horrible things in the past, like when I was 8th grade I said I wanted to ""shoot up"" my school because I thought everyone hated me, even though they probably didn't at all. And I think I really did. I hate myself for saying this. It's weird to think that I said that because I'm such a different person now. But sometimes I get scared that maybe if I was pushed enough I would think that again. I don't feel like I would, but then again how do I know? I've never even killed a fly, I feel too bad.
